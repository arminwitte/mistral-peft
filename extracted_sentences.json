    "iii Kurzfassung Untersucht wurde das dynamische Verhalten des Wärmeübergangs und der Wand- schubspannung eines Zylinders in pulsierender Querströmung für kleine Störun- gen der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit.",
    "In diesem Regime ist der zeitlich gemittelte Wärmeübergang konstant, und Fluktuationen von Strömungsvariablen können als lineares, zeitinvariantes System beschrieben werden.",
    "Es wurde ein großer Bereich von Reynolds-Zahlen 0.1 ≤Re≤3900 mit Schwerpunkt auf die Regime ohne Wirbe- lablösung untersucht (Re ≤40).",
    "Letztere sind besonders interessant für Anwendun- gen wie das Rijke-Rohr und die Hitzdrahtanemometrie.",
    "Methoden der Systemidentifikation in Kombination mit CFD-Simulation (CFD/SI) wurden zur Datengenerierung verwendet.",
    "Die Übertragungsfunktionen von Ge- schwindigkeitspulsationen zu Pulsationen in Wärmeübergang und Wandschub- spannung wurden mit drei verschiedenen Methoden bewertet: Anregung einer numerischen Simulation mit der Sprungfunktion, Breitbandanregung von CFD- Simulationen kombiniert mit linearer Systemidentifikation und Lösen der lineari- sierten Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen im Frequenzbereich.",
    "Für Untersuchungen bei unterkritischer Strömung wurden LES-Simulationen verwendet.",
    "Die Dynamik des Wärmeübergangs und der Wandschubspannung wird von meh- reren Zeitskalen bestimmt.",
    "Diese entsprechen den jeweiligen Reaktionszeiten des Geschwindigkeitsfeldes und des Temperaturfeldes.",
    "Es gibt jedoch keine einfache Analogie wie die Reynolds-Analogie für stationäre Strömungen.",
    "Die Wechselwir- kung der verschiedenen Zeitverzögerungen führt zu einer nicht trivialen Abhängig- keit der Frequenzantwort des Wärmeübergangs und der Wandschubspannung von Strouhal-Zahlen und Reynolds-Zahlen.",
    "In der Literatur verfügbare Modelle für das dynamische Verhalten von Wärmeübergang und Wandschubspannung stimmen nur bis zu einem gewissen Grad mit den simulierten Daten überein.",
    "Diese Arbeit liefert ein Meta-Modell niedriger Ordnung, das den Wärmeübergang bei Reynolds- Zahlen in der Größenordnung von 10 besonders gut abbildet.",
    "Quantitative Ergebnisse werden für einen großen Bereich von Reynolds-Zahlen und Strouhal-Zahlen angegeben.",
    "Andere möglicherweise relevante Parameter wie ab- solute Temperaturdifferenzen, temperaturabhängige Eigenschaften und hohe Am- plituden wurden nicht erschöpfend behandelt.",
    "Das sehr vielseitige Verfahren kann jedoch für weitere Untersuchungen in dieser Hinsicht adaptiert werden.",
    "iv Abstract The dynamic behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow for small perturbations of flow velocity was investigated.",
    "In this regime, the time-averaged heat transfer is constant, and fluctuations of flow variables can be described as linear, time-invariant dynamics.",
    "A wide range of Reynolds numbers 0.1≤Re≤3900 was studied with emphasis on the regimes without vortex shedding (Re≤40).",
    "The latter are of particular interest for applications like the Rijke tube and hot-wire anemometry.",
    "Using system identification techniques in combination with CFD simulation (CFD/SI) for data generation, the transfer functions from velocity pulsations to pulsations in heat transfer and skin friction were assessed with three different methods: Step excitation of a numerical simulation, broadband excitation of CFD simulations combined with linear system identification, and solving the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in the frequency domain.",
    "For investigations in subcritical flow, LES simulations were used.",
    "The heat transfer and skin friction dynamics are governed by several time scales.",
    "These correspond to the respective response times of the velocity field and the tem- perature field.",
    "However, no simple analogy, like the Reynolds analogy for steady flow, exists.",
    "The interaction of the different time lags leads to a non-trivial depen- dence of the frequency response of heat transfer and skin friction on Strouhal num- bers and Reynolds numbers.",
    "Available analytical models for the dynamic behavior of skin friction and heat transfer match the simulated data only up to a point.",
    "This thesis provides a low-order meta-model, which excels at Reynolds numbers of order 10.",
    "Quantitative results are given for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Strouhal numbers.",
    "Other possibly relevant parameters, such as absolute temperature differ- ences, temperature-dependent properties, and high amplitudes were not covered exhaustively.",
    "However, the very versatile procedure can be very useful for further investigations in this regard.",
    "v Teile der vorliegenden Dissertationsschrift wurden vom Autor bereits vorab auf Konferenzen vorgetragen und als Konferenz- und Zeitschriftenbeiträge veröffent- licht (Strobio Chen et al., 2015; Witte et al., 2016a,b; Witte and Polifke, 2015, 2016, 2017a,b, 2019).",
    "Alle Vorveröffentlichungen sind entsprechend der gültigen Promo- tionsordnung ordnungsgemäß gemeldet.",
    "Sie sind deshalb nicht zwangsläufig im Detail einzeln referenziert.",
    "Vielmehr wurde bei der Referenzierung eigener Vorver- öffentlichungen Wert auf Verständlichkeit und inhaltlichen Bezug gelegt.",
    "Parts of this Ph.D. thesis have been presented by the author at conferences and published beforehand in conference proceeding or journal papers (Strobio Chen et al., 2015; Witte et al., 2016a,b; Witte and Polifke, 2015, 2016, 2017a,b, 2019).",

xxiv 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.1.1 Energy Conversion and Environmental Aspects Energy conversion is one of the most important factors in the history of humankind.",
    "Fire, which is the conversion of some type of fuel to chemical products, light, and heat by oxidation, was harnessed even in prehistoric times.",
    "Later, more sources of primary energy—natural sources of energy—were used and converted into mechan- ical energy, e.g.",
    "in windmills, water wheels for gristmills, and trip hammers.",
    "The industrial revolution, starting in the second half of the 18th century, was made pos- sible by the increasing use of steam power with coal as the primary energy source.",
    "From an engineering perspective, the conversion of energy from one form to an- other is one of the main tasks.",
    "Energy is needed for electricity, heat, transporta- tion, and the manufacturing of goods.",
    "In 2014, the supplied primary energy for the whole world was 13699 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) which amounts to 159319 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016).",
    "Oil, coal, and natural gas, all of which are fossil fuels, made up more than 80 % of all fuel shares (International Energy Agency, 2016).",
    "A total of 108043 TWh was consumed in 2014, 29.4 % of which by industry and 28.3 % by transportation.",
    "A share of 8.9 % of the consumed primary energy was put to non-energy use, e.g.",
    "chemical products (International Energy Agency, 2017).",
    "The total generation of electricity and heat in power stations was 23816 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016) and 3815 TWh, respectively (Inter- national Energy Agency, 2017).",
    "With losses of 32203 TWh, this leads to an overall efficiency for the conversion of primary energy to electricity and heat of 46.2 %.",
    "The use of carbon (coal) or hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) as energy source bears—among others—two main problems: During the combustion process nitrous oxides (NO x) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are generated in considerable amounts.",
    "NO xis associated with negative consequences for the health of humans (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2003) and is a precursor for other pollutants such as acid rain.",
    "CO 2plays a major role in the greenhouse effect determining earth’s sur- face temperature (Rodhe, 1990; Lacis et al., 2010).",
    "The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is caused to 60 % by the man-made emission of CO 2(Rodhe, 1990).",
    "In the last 200 years, the concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere rose from about 280 1 1 Introduction parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm (Houghton and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001).",
    "CO 2is besides water one of the main products of the combustion process and can only be reduced by increasing efficiency.",
    "To counteract the negative effect of the energy sector on the environment, the United Nations Summit in Brasil 1992 published objectives for the “energy devel- opment, efficiency and consumption” in the “ Agenda 21” United Nations : The basic and ultimate objective of this programme area is to reduce adverse effects on the atmosphere from the energy sector by promot- ing policies or programmes, as appropriate, to increase the contribution of environmentally sound and cost-effective energy systems, particu- larly new and renewable ones, through less polluting and more efficient energy production, transmission, distribution and use.",
    "This objective should reflect the need for equity, adequate energy supplies and increas- ing energy consumption in developing countries, [.",
    ".",
    ".",
    "], and the situations of countries highly vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change.",
    "This paragraph emphasizes the need for more efficient energy production and new energy systems.",
    "Both goals can only be achieved through research on existing ma- chinery and principles as well as on new approaches.",
    "1.1.2 Transformation Between Thermal Energy and Acoustic Energy One energy conversion mechanism that has to be taken into consideration is the conversion from thermal energy to acoustic energy and vice versa.",
    "Research in this area offers possibilities to achieve both objectives from the United Nations Summit: higher efficiency of existing technology and new approaches to energy conversion.",
    "Although known for about two centuries, this conversion mechanism has been ne- glected and came into focus again rather recently.",
    "The term thermoacoustics was coined to describe this effect which was first reported by Higgins  and Rijke .",
    "Higgins  discovered that a hydrogen flame placed in a tube would emit sound.",
    "This setup is now known as the “singing flame” .",
    "Later a similar phenomenon was found by Rijke  who was experimenting with a heated wire mesh inside a resonator tube.",
    "He also experienced a clear sound that was emitted from the open ends of the resonator.",
    "The device is now called the Rijke tube.",
    "Credit is also due to Rayleigh  who was the first to put thermoacoustics on a firm theoretical foundation.",
    "He recognized that the dynamics of the heat transfer between flame or heated wire and the fluid in the tube is the essential ingredient.",
    "At the time of these discoveries, these pioneers could not possibly image which importance their research might have for energy systems today.",
    "2 1.1 Motivation Thermoacoustic Instabilities in Energy Systems An example of a well-established energy system is the stationary industrial gas tur- bine.",
    "Modern gas turbines for electricity generation operate with lean and premixed combustion (Keller, 1995).",
    "Air is compressed to pressures as high as 30 times the environmental pressure (Jansohn, 2010).",
    "Subsequently, the air is mixed with natural gas in a plenum and oxidized at a high air–fuel ratio in the burner.",
    "The combustion products enter the turbine section at temperatures up to 1400◦C (Jansohn, 2010).",
    "The turbine converts the energy of the hot flue gas into mechanical energy driving the compressor and an electric generator to produce electrical energy.",
    "Gas turbines have a severe impact on the environment.",
    "A portion of 21.6 % of the total electricity was produced from natural gas (International Energy Agency, 2016) and mostly in gas turbines.",
    "In predictions for the year 2040, this share is expected to rise to 27.5 % (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016).",
    "The optimal op- erating point, especially the flame temperature, is determined by the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and NO xproduced in the combustion process.",
    "Lean pre- mixed combustion is however prone to thermoacoustic instabilities (Keller, 1995; Paschereit and Polifke, 1998; Jansohn, 2010; Laera et al., 2014).",
    "If such an instability occurs, small fluctuations in pressure and fluid velocity are amplified greatly.",
    "This amplitude can be as high as 1 % of the mean operating pressure of the combustion (Paschereit and Polifke, 1998).",
    "This has a negative impact on efficiency and the life cycle of the gas turbine (Laera et al., 2014).",
    "In turn, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted by the power plant is directly related to its efficiency.",
    "Moreover, ther- moacoustic oscillations disallows certain working conditions, e.g.",
    "turndown, that would allow a more flexible energy generation.",
    "Increasing the efficiency and flex- ibility of gas turbines for power generation would have a positive effect on their environmental impact.",
    "Domestic boilers, used for heat production on a household level are also prone to thermoacoustic instabilities.",
    "Large pulsations can be harmful to the device and im- pede efficiency similar to the gas turbine.",
    "In domestic boilers, the heat exchanger, which holds the water to be heated by the flue gas from the combustion, also in- fluences the thermoacoustic stability of this system (Strobio Chen et al., 2015).",
    "The heat exchanger is a cold, coiled tube placed in the hot flue gas stream in a cross- flow configuration.",
    "The heat transfer between the gas and the heat exchanger tubes can dampen or drive pressure oscillations.",
    "Of particular importance to this effect is the time lag between heat transfer and pressure oscillation.",
    "This phase lag decides whether acoustic fluctuations are dampened or excited.",
    "3 1 Introduction Harnessing the Thermoacoustic Effect In the above-mentioned examples of the gas turbine and the domestic boiler, the thermoacoustic effect, where thermal energy is converted into pressure fluctuations and acoustic velocity fluctuations, are harmful and thus unwanted.",
    "However, the thermoacoustic effect can be harnessed in devices such as a thermoacoustic engine or a thermoacoustic refrigerator.",
    "In the thermoacoustic engine, strong temperature gradients are created—most often through the use of heat exchangers—at a compo- nent called stack or regenerator.",
    "The working gas moves back and forth through the temperature gradient.",
    "It absorbs heat closer to the hot side, leading to an expansion of the gas and releases the heat to the stack at the cold end and thus the gas is com- pressed.",
    "Periodic compression and expansion of the working gas is acoustic energy, which can be converted to mechanical energy or electrical energy or be transmitted to a second thermoacoustic stage.",
    "This second stage also has a stack and two heat exchangers.",
    "At the second stack, a temperature gradient develops caused by the acoustic oscillation.",
    "The hot end is cooled against ambient conditions allowing the cold side to assume temperatures below ambient conditions.",
    "This is called a ther- moacoustic refrigerator.",
    "It does not necessarily have to be implemented as a second thermoacoustic stage but can also be driven, e.g.",
    "by a piston.",
    "These configurations are rather simple to build and very robust.",
    "The basic body is usually a rigid resonator tube with closed ends.",
    "However, as of today, devices harnessing the thermoacoustic effect suffer from low efficiency.",
    "1.1.3 Heat Transfer Dynamics in Unsteady Flow The configurations mentioned in the previous sections in which thermoacoustics play a vital role can be divided into two groups.",
    "In the “singing flame” and the gas turbine, the combustion process is driving the instabilities.",
    "In contrast, in the Rijke tube, in domestic boilers, as well as in thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators the fluctuations are driven by the heat transfer between the fluid (working gas) and a solid body.",
    "This makes the heat transfer between a solid body in fluctuating flow worthwhile investigating.",
    "Moreover, configurations with solid–gas heat transfer, like the Rijke tube, are often used in the basic research of combustion instabilities.",
    "The Rijke tube, in particular, is the prototype of a thermoacoustic device (Rijke, 1859; Raun et al., 1993).",
    "It has gained interest for the study of the phenomenon of thermoacoustic oscillations in the last decades although there are little direct applications in industry.",
    "It is a cheap tool to study thermoacoustic phenomena as they occur, as a potentially harmful byproduct, in stationary gas turbines for power generation (Benoit and Nicoud, 2005).",
    "In the case of the Rijke tube, for example, the centerpiece is a heated wire, usually in the form of a loosely wound coil or mesh.",
    "A resonator tube, hence the name Rijke 4 1.2 Aims tube, sets the conditions for fluctuations to grow in strength.",
    "This makes the config- uration of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow the perfect specimen for basic research in this area.",
    "The single cylinder stands for the wire, and the acoustic wave inside the tube is represented by the pulsations.",
    "An additional practical example, where the effect of a bluff body in fluctuating cross- flow plays a vital role is hot-wire anemometry (Bruun, 1996).",
    "For this method for flow measurement, turbulence and its effect on the heat transfer are important.",
    "Here, the pulsations are due to fluctuations occurring in turbulent flow.",
    "Closely related to the transfer of heat between solid body and fluid is the transfer of momentum.",
    "It appears as the skin friction on the surface of the solid body.",
    "Although of lesser importance for cylindrical configurations, the effect of its dynamic behav- ior can be seen as the Basset history force in the case of a solid spherical particle Basset .",
    "It significantly influences the trajectory of a particle in unsteady flow or if the particle experiences acceleration.",
    "1.1.4 Modeling and Modeling Techniques In the case of any complex phenomenon, there is a desire for modeling.",
    "A model, often in the form of mathematical formulas, is a vehicle to understand phenomena, to place them in a greater perspective and can ultimately serve as a design tool.",
    "Hence, this thesis is also motivated by the desire to find an adequate procedure to acquire a model for the dynamic behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow and to provide models for cases like the Rijke tube.",
    "This has never been done in such detail using data based modeling techniques.",
    "The models presented in this thesis refer to the heated wire in the Rijke tube mostly and can directly be used in research activities involving a Rijke tube.",
    "Additionally, the techniques refined and assessed in this thesis can be applied on similar configu- rations like domestic boilers and thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators.",
    "It is also of interest in research directly related to gas turbines.",
    "This thesis tries to make a step towards a sustainable and ecologically sensitive energy production by improving the models and modeling techniques in the area of thermoacoustics.",
    "1.2 Aims This thesis had three main goals: The first objective was to give an exhaustive qual- itative and quantitative description of the linear dynamic behavior of heat trans- fer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow in different flow regimes (Reynolds numbers).",
    "In particular, Reynolds numbers Re ≤40 are of interest for 5 1 Introduction the Rijke tube and hot-wire anemometry.",
    "Implications for these pulsating flow con- figurations are drawn.",
    "The limitations of previous studies of this problem, e.g.",
    "by Lighthill , are scrutinized.",
    "Crucial assumptions are identified and compared to solutions from computational fluid dynamics (CFD).",
    "This way, a much more com- prehensive understanding of the complex flow physics was achieved.",
    "The assessment of techniques for system identification (SI) in combination with CFD simulation for data generation in the scope of skin friction and heat transfer was the second aim.",
    "This procedure not only supplements the first goal but also provides a framework for further studies in this field using SI techniques.",
    "The final objective was to develop low-order models for skin friction and heat trans- fer.",
    "Transfer functions—as they often appear in control theory—are well founded in theory and provide a concise representation of the results.",
    "A parametrized low- order model for the heat transfer dynamics is of avail in the modeling of the Rijke tube for further studies on thermoacoustic oscillations.",
    "Particular attention was given to two phenomena: peak gain that occurs at low but non-zero frequencies and the phase difference at high frequencies.",
    "1.3 Scope This thesis is based on techniques and methods introduced by Föller et al.",
    "for the investigation of this problem, but represents a significant advancement over previous computational studies (Apelt and Ledwich, 1979; Kwon and Lee, 1985; Nicoli and Pelcé, 1989; Payne, 1958; Föller et al., 2008).",

    "A thorough derivation was given, e.g.",
    "by Schlichting and Gersten .",
    "They make use of the fact that, if the viscosity is small, a surface with no-slip condition affects the flow field only in a small region close to the surface: the boundary layer.",
    "Two main assumptions are made to derive the equations: (1) The boundary layer thickness is proportional to the square root of the viscosity δ∼⎷ν.",
    "(2) The boundary layer thickness is much smaller than the characteristic length of the body submerged in the fluid.",
    "For a streamlined body, the characteristic length is the length along which the flow occurs.",

    "Hence, the outer flow is governed by the Euler equations (White, 2007), which 44 3.2 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations neglect the viscous terms.",

    "For the calculation at low frequencies, such a simplification cannot be invoked.",
    "To solve the boundary layer equations, an integral Kármán– Polhausen treatment (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006, Section 8.1) was used.",

    "Heckl  linearized King’s Law and modified it with a time-lagged velocity fluc- tuation u′(t−τ) to account for the dynamics of the heat transfer.",
    "This simple model is written as Q̇′=Lw(Tw−T∞)√︄ πk cvρd 2uu′, (3.58) which is an application of the n−τmodel, is called Modified King’s Law.",

    "The parameters are the steady-state gain Kand a time constant cτ.",
    "It is used to describe the heat transfer dynamics in conjunction with the Modified King’s Law where the time constant is not used in conjunction with a PT1 model, but as the time lag of the n−τmodel.",

    "Section 4.4 deals with the sys- tem identification process employed to build models from acquired data and finally techniques to validate identified models are shown in Section 4.5.",
    "The last section of this chapter (i.e.",
    "Section 4.6) shows how system theory is applied to the dynamics of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow.",
    "4.1 Linear Time Invariant Systems The notion of a linear and time invariant (LTI) system is important for the applica- tion of system theory.",
    "A large set of methods exists to describe and process this type of system.",
    "The assumptions involved—linearity and time invariance—are often jus- tified, or situations can be found when an LTI description is sufficiently accurate.",
    "In these cases, considerations based on linear theory lead to good results (Ljung, 1999).",
    "74 4.1 Linear Time Invariant Systems 4.1.1 Definition An LTI system is defined by two characteristics: linearity and time invariance.",
    "Time invariance implies system characteristics do not change with time and thus its re- sponse to a certain input signal does not depend on absolute time (Ljung, 1999).",
    "This means that an arbitrary operator f, representing the system dynamics, applied to a signal shifted in time yields the same result but with the same shift in time as the signal.",
    "This can be represented by Ifu(t)f−→ y(t) , then u(t−τ)f−→ y(t−τ) (4.1) where uand ydenote input time series and result time series of a time invariant operation fandτis a constant shift time (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "A system, represented by the operator f, is considered linear if its response to a linear combination (sum) of inputs is the same as the linear combination of the re- sponses to the individual inputs (Ljung, 1999).",
    "This holds, even if a constant scaling factor is applied and can be written by f(a u 1+u2)=a f(u1)+f(u2) (4.2) where u1and u2are the variables, fis the linear operation, and ais a constant (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "Linearity implies that the principles of homogeneity (multiplica- tion with a constant factor) and superposition (addition of inputs) hold.",
    "The latter explicitly allows any complex time series to be decomposed into simpler signals, e.g.",
    "individual impulses.",
    "The linearity requirement may be violated due to constant offsets in input and output.",
    "In this case, linear models can relate deviation variables that vary around a nominal operating point.",
    "These offsets are estimated (mean) and removed to achieve a linear equation, e.g.",
    "(y−y0)=f(u−u0) (4.3) where y0and u0denote the (quasi-)steady state of output and input, respectively (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "Generally, the linear model may consist of a first-order Taylor’s series approximation of the nonlinear system around a steady state (cf.",
    "Section 2.4) (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "4.1.2 Properties LTI systems exhibit two general properties important for modeling purposes: causality/non-causality and stability/instability .",
    "A suitable model has to reflect these properties, e.g.",
    "a model should be non-causal if the system is non-causal.",
    "75 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Causality If the response at a certain time depends only on the input up to this instant in time, i.e.",
    "it does not depend on ”future“ values, then the system is called causal.",
    "A system in which the past, present, and future inputs are involved is referred to as non-causal (Ljung, 1999).",
    "Stability The assumption of stability implies that the response of a system will not grow in- definitely.",
    "More precisely, an LTI system is said to be stable, if all bounded-inputs yield bounded-outputs (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "This is the concept of a BIBO stable system which is a standard definition for LTI system.",
    "BIBO stability is denoted by ∥y(t)∥ < ∞ for all ∥u(t)∥ < ∞ .",
    "(4.4) This is important for the modeling process as a model for a stable system should also be stable (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "If a steady state exists, this indicates that the system is stable (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "4.1.3 Convolution Model and Impulse Response A model should relate an input (function) to an output (function) by a mathematical operation.",
    "For an LTI system, this can be achieved using the convolution operation.",
    "From the pointwise multiplication of a function with another (shifted) function in- tegrated over the shift variable a third function results.",
    "This can be written as y(t)=∞∫︂ −∞g(τ)u(t−τ)dτ=g(t)∗u(t).",
    "(4.5) This type of model is referred to as convolution model and is the most fundamental representation of an LTI system (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "The third function involved, g(τ), is called impulse response function .",
    "This is due to the fact that this is the response generated by the system when excited with a unit impulse (Dirac δfunction, the neutral element of the convolution) defined by δ(t)≡0 for all t̸=0 and∞∫︂ −∞δ(t)dt=1.",
    "(4.6) 76 4.1 Linear Time Invariant Systems The impulse response exhaustively describes the dynamic behavior of an LTI system (Keesman, 2011).",
    "It is equivalent to the concept of Green’s Functions (Duffy, 2001).",
    "For a causal system with zero initial conditions, the convolution model is given by y(t)=t∫︂ 0g(τ)u(t−τ)dτ (4.7) using only information from a start time “0” up to the current time t. The foundation of the impulse response function is the superposition principle.",
    "It states that the response of a linear system to the simultaneous action of several causes is obtained by first determining the effects of the separate causes and then adding them in the proper manner (cf.",
    "definition of linearity and time invariance).",
    "If a system is BIBO stable, then the impulse response is absolutely convergent (Tan- girala, 2014).",
    "This can be expressed as ∞∫︂ −∞g(t)dt< ∞ .",
    "(4.8) 4.1.4 Transfer Function Causal convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the Laplace domain (Keesman, 2011).",
    "Applying the Laplace transform (Phillips et al., 2008) defined by F(s)=L{f(t)}=∞∫︂ 0f(t)e−stdt (4.9) with the complex-valued frequency parameter s=σ+iωto input u(t), output y(t), and impulse response function g(t), Equation (4.5) can be written as Y(s)=G(s)·U(s).",
    "(4.10) The frequency parameter s∈Cis a complex-valued quantity with the angular fre- quency ωas imaginary part and the growth rate σas real part.",
    "G(s), which is the Laplace transform of the impulse response function g(t), is called transfer function .",
    "For convenience, the notation y=Gu (4.11) is introduced.",
    "It reads “the linear operator G, representing the LTI system, is applied tou” .",
    "The operator Ghas to be in the same domain as the signals yand u.",
    "This is the fundamental representation of dynamic behavior used in this thesis.",

    "Input(s) u, output(s) y, and a disturbance v. Based on Söderström and Stoica .",
    "4.1.5 Disturbances In dealing with real systems, the mapping from input to output may not be perfect, yet disturbances can influence the system.",
    "Among these disturbances are measure- ment noise and uncontrollable inputs.",
    "In general, they represent the influence of the environment on the system.",
    "These disturbances have to be taken into account as they effect the quality of the model.",
    "Different authors categorize disturbances in various ways, but most distinguish two types.",
    "An input disturbance wis characterized by the fact that it is an exogenous signal originating from the environment and directly affecting the behavior of the system (Keesman, 2011).",
    "It can be measured (Ljung, 1999; Tangirala, 2014) and it has external causes (Isermann and Münchhof, 2011), i.e.",
    "the influence of the en- vironment on the system.",
    "In contrast, the output disturbance v(Keesman, 2011) is an exogenous signal that affects the output but cannot be manipulated like the input.",
    "This disturbance is not measured (Tangirala, 2014), but may be observed due to its impact on the output (Ljung, 1999).",
    "It can also be interpreted as inter- nal disturbance (Isermann and Münchhof, 2011).",
    "A distinction between measured disturbance wand inputs uis often less important for the system identification process (Ljung, 1999).",
    "Thus, wis omitted in the following sections.",
    "Figure 4.1 above depicts a system that is only influenced by inputs.",
    "This corresponds to a purely deterministic model.",
    "However, in the scope of disturbances, a more re- alistic system is shown in Figure 4.2.",
    "A stochastic disturbance v(t) is included to account for unpredictable signals.",

    "(4.12) The noise free deterministic model is given by x(t)=Gu(t) (4.13) where Gis the representation of the deterministic part of the system, i.e.",
    "transfer function, applied to the input.",

    "it origi- nates from white noise , but may be colored .",
    "This is denoted by v(t)=He(t) (4.14) where His a model for the noise spectrum applied to the white noise sequence e(t).",
    "Figure 4.3 depicts these relationships.",
    "Following Tangirala (2014, p. 14), the continuous time description is widely used for deterministic systems.",
    "Stochastic influences, i.e.",
    "disturbances, are quantified in adiscrete time frame as they are picked up by sensors usually working in discrete time.",
    "This is in accordance with Ljung (1999, p. 233) who regards continuous time white noise descriptions as delicate mathematical objects.",
    "He suggests dealing with hybrid models, where the noise is handled in discrete time.",
    "Nevertheless, Beygi and Dounavis  reported an approach to include noise modeling using an in- strumental variable method.",
    "In this thesis a purely discrete time point of view was adopted whenever disturbance or noise modeling was of importance.",
    "79 4 Linear Dynamic Systems White Noise and Colored Noise The disturbance vis generally any kind of signal not part of the deterministic system and therefore, by definition, unpredictable.",
    "To account for this, it is deduced from a random signal e(t) and filtered by a model for the stochastic part H(c.f.",
    "Equa- tion (4.14)).",
    "The random signal is often modeled as white noise (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "It is a sequence of uncorrelated variables with zero mean (stationary) and finite variance.",
    "A useful assumption is that the variables follow a normal distribution Nwith variance σ2 e. This is denoted by e[k]∼N(0,σ2 e) (4.15) and is called Gaussian white noise (GWN).",
    "Signal–to–Noise Ratio The signal–to–noise ratio (SNR) is a measure for the strength of the (true) response of the system compared to the noise.",
    "A high SNR is paramount for all estimation methods to achieve good models.",
    "The overall SNR is evaluated as the ratio of the variances of output and noise given by SNR=σ2 x σ2v.",
    "(4.16) A frequency dependent estimate can be found by using the asymptotic ensemble av- erage of the power spectral density (PSD) γ.",
    "The SNR is defined in frequency domain as SNR(ω)=γxx(ω) γv v(ω)(4.17) where γxxandγv vare the PSDs of the noise-free output and the noise, respectively (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "Coherence The coherence is used to determine if a linear relationship between two signals exists.",
    "It is given by |κyu(ω)|2=⃓⃓⃓⃓⃓γyu(ω) √︁γuu(ω)γy y(ω)⃓⃓⃓⃓⃓2 =1 1+1/SNR( ω).",
    "(4.18) 80 4.2 Data Basis If the coherence is not unity |κyu(ω)|2̸=1 this can cave two reasons.",
    "(1) uand ydepend on each other non-linearly or (2) the linear relationship is hidden by a high noise level.",
    "This is shown in Equation (4.18), where the coherence is linked to the SNR.",
    "These measures are used to determine a priori if good estimates can be expected at certain frequency ranges when estimating an LTI model.",
    "4.2 Data Basis Information on systems can be acquired from various sources and in different frameworks.",
    "Most commonly, it can be distinguished between time and frequency domain as well as between discrete and continuous data.",
    "These concepts are impor- tant for data handling and data manipulation.",
    "4.2.1 Continuous and Discrete Time Data Time is usually experienced as continuous and variables evolving over time are thus modeled as continuous variables.",
    "Many concepts, i.e.",
    "differential equations, are based on the notion of continuity.",
    "However, measurements are usually snapshots taken at certain instants in time.",
    "Successive measurements may be acquired distinct intervals of time apart.",
    "Thus, the variable is observed at discrete sampling instants.",
    "This concept, in contrast to continuous time, is called discrete time.",
    "In numerical computations of unsteady processes, only solutions at discrete instants in time are calculated.",
    "Sampling The transformation from continuous time to discrete time is called sampling .",
    "Dis- crete values are picked from a continuous time series in intervals called sampling times .",
    "In the case of periodic sampling, the temporal spacing between sampling instants is constant.",
    "This time Tsis referred to as the sampling interval with [ Ts]= time units per sample.",
    "It can be seen as one time unit.",
    "Any sampled instant is writ- ten in continuous time by t=k T swith k=0,1,..., N−1 where Nis the total number of samples.",
    "Accordingly, a sampling frequency is defined by Fs=1/Tswith [Fs]=samples/time (Tangirala, 2014) and ωs=2πFs=2π/Tsfor the angular fre- quency, respectively.",
    "One of the most important statements in signal processing is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem (Åström and Wittenmark, 1997).",
    "It states that for a given sam- pling frequency Fsperfect reconstruction of a signal (in continuous time) is possible for a bandlimit ofFNy=Fs/2.",
    "The term bandlimit refers to a finite frequency above 81 4 Linear Dynamic Systems which the power spectral density of the signal is zero.",
    "The frequency FNyis called the Nyquist frequency .",
    "Similarly, the Nyquist rate , at which a bandlimited signal has to be sampled, is 2 FNy.",
    "If the sampling theorem is violated, aliasing occurs.",
    "Frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency appear as lower frequencies falsifying the signal.",
    "This defect can- not be recovered a posteriori and has to be avoided, e.g.",
    "by low-pass filtering a signal before (down-)sampling.",
    "(Tangirala, 2014) Sampling (with zero-order hold) has an impact on the definition of causality of a system.",
    "Although a system is still considered causal, if no future inputs affect the output, the term strict causality is introduced (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "It also excludes in- stantaneous effects at time k=0 which are “unphysical” in a sense that if input and output are measured at the same instant, any signal would have to travel infinitely fast in order to cause a response at k=0.",
    "Reconstruction A common way to transform a discrete time signal to continuous time is to hold the discrete value for Tsand then assume the next discrete value.",
    "This is called zero-order hold (ZOH).",
    "Analogously, the first-order hold (FOH) interpolates linearly between two successive values.",
    "This, however, is only possible, if the next value is already known.",
    "4.2.2 Frequency Domain In contrast to the time domain, the frequency domain does not quantify the evolu- tion of a signal but the recurrence of patterns.",
    "The most versatile representation of the frequency domain is the s-domain or Laplace domain.",
    "For periodic signals, i.e.",
    "a superposition of sine waves, the Fourier transform was established.",
    "In the discrete framework, both concepts are represented by the Z -domain and the discrete Fourier transform , respectively.",

    "The Laplace transform converts a function in the time domain to the frequency domain.",
    "It is defined in Equation (4.9) and (originally) restricted to functions of twith t>0 (unilateral Laplace transform).",
    "The inverse Laplace transform is denoted L−1.",
    "82 4.2 Data Basis Fourier Transform The continuous Fourier transform is similar to the Laplace transform with two ma- jor differences: The Fourier transform is evaluated for −∞ < t< ∞ rather than starting at zero, which would be equivalent to a bilateral Laplace transform.",
    "Further- more, the complex-valued argument sis reduced to iω, i.e.",
    "the growth rate σ=0.",
    "Thus, it can only represent stable systems (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "The Fourier transform is defined as fˆ(ω)=F{f[k]}=+∞∫︂ −∞e−iωtf(t)dt.",
    "(4.19) The result of a Fourier transformation is called the frequency domain representa- tion of f(t).",
    "It can be interpreted as the amplitude and the phase shift at a certain frequency ω.",
    "In discrete time, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) exists.",
    "The DTFD for- mally requires an infinitely long input signal.",
    "Hence, for computational purposes, the signal is assumed to be periodic, and the corresponding technique is called discrete Fourier transform (DFT) given by fˆN(ω)=1⎷ NN−1∑︂ k=0f[k]e−iωdl(4.20) for a sampled signal f[k]) with k=0,1,2,..., N−1.",

    "Similarly, the Gauss–Newton method uses the OLS method on the residuals to improve an initial guess of the parameters iteratively.",
    "For the Gauß–Newton method, the residual of the ith iteration is given by ϵi=y−yˆ(︂ θ(i))︂ (4.67) where the estimated output yˆ(︁ θ(i))︁ depends on the parameters evaluated in the ith iteration.",
    "As for the OLS method, the goal of the Gauß–Newton method is to find a minimum where the derivative of the objective function with respect to the coefficients is zero.",
    "Instead of introducing the objective function V, like in Equa- tion (4.56), it is more convenient to use the derivatives of the estimated output evaluated by Ψ(θ)=∂ϵ(θ) ∂θ=[︃∂ϵ ∂θ1...]︃T (4.68) as defined in Equation (4.53).",
    "These are called pseudo-regressors in the nonlinear framework.",

    "(4.69) The relation of the NLS method to the OLS method becomes even more apparent in the fact that if the estimator is linear, then Ψ→Φ(Nocedal and Wright, 2006).",
    "The Levenberg–Marquardt method (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) can be seen as an improved version of the Gauß–Newton algorithm.",
    "It uses a trust region approach, similar to regularization, to enhance stability and convergence.",
    "Moreover, efficient implementations involving QR-factorization are known for the Gauß–Newton and Levenberg–Marquardt methods.",
    "The mentioned NLS methods need initial values for the search algorithm.",
    "These initial values are crucial as NLS algorithms are prone to become “trapped” in a local minimum instead of finding the true global minimum.",

    "However, if the residuals are not GWN, the OLS procedure will never yield the true values of θ(Ljung, 1999).",
    "Hence, the regression model is biased whenever the equation error is colored (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "Variance Besides accuracy, the ability to estimate the “true” value, precision is important.",

    "A weak perturba- tion (ϵ=0.1) was imposed to assure a linear response.",
    "The sudden change is applied within one time step and simulation is continued until a new stationary state (only very small changes over time) is reached.",

    "(5.9) Again, ϵdenotes the amplitude of the pulsation and is set to ϵ=0.1 to investigate the linear frequency response.",
    "This amplitude was chosen to keep well below the threshold of about ϵ≈0.3 where the approximation of an LTI systems ceases to be valid in the case of the heat transfer (Heckl, 1990; Hantschk and Vortmeyer, 1999; Selimefendigil et al., 2012).",
    "A nonlinear response in heat transfer and even flow reversal could be achieved by ϵ>1.0.",
    "Broadband Input The broadband excitation is used in simulations to create and acquire the data for the SI procedure.",
    "The broadband input in combination with SI has many advan- tages over the step input and the sine input.",
    "In contrast to the step input, which would theoretically be sufficient to describe the LTI dynamics, a broadband signal continuously excites the system and is, therefore, less prone to disturbances influ- encing the response.",
    "The frequency spectrum of the input can be predefined and hence also very high frequencies, possibly interfering with the convergence of the numerical procedure, are avoided.",
    "This is also the main advantage over the sine input.",

    "The prototype wavelet is designed with the desired features like a specific corner frequency.",
    "The time series is created with the desired overall length as fluctuations in the interval [ −1, 1].",
    "To acquire the proper input signal for the CFD simulations, the time series was scaled, and a constant for the mean flow was added.",
    "If necessary, the time series was pre-filtered with a fifth order Butterworth filter to achieve the desired frequency spectrum.",
    "This is beneficial for CFD simulations, because the signal varies smoothly between time instances.",
    "The corner frequency chosen for this thesis corresponds to Sr ≈60.",
    "This is high enough so that a good power spectral density of the frequency range of interest 0 ≤Sr≤40 is achieved, but the changes between successive input values are small enough to not impede the convergence of the CFD simulation.",
    "To have a sufficiently smooth input signal, a recommendation is to ensure 20<ωs ωb<40 (5.10) where ωs=2π/Tsis the sampling frequency and ωbis the 3 dB bandwidth of the signal (Franklin et al., 1997, Chapter 11).",
    "It was therefore reasonable to sample the input signal with Ts=0.001.",
    "An advantage of the non-Gaussian simulation is that the input signal does not fol- low a Gaussian distribution, but is almost uniformly distributed.",
    "This results in a comparably high crest factor (Tangirala, 2014), which is desirable for identification experiments because the amplitude extrema are assumed more often than in the case of a random Gauss signal.",
    "5.2.2 Computational Procedure To perform SI, time series data for the quantities of interest needed to be generated.",
    "In order to obtain these time series, a simulation over a certain period of time had to be carried out.",
    "For this simulation an algorithm that solves Equations (2.63) to (2.65) accurately for every time step was necessary.",

    "This algorithm is the combination of two well-known algorithms for transient simulations, PISO (Issa, 1986) and transient-SIMPLE (Patankar and Spald- ing, 1972; Caretto et al., 1973).",
    "It employs two so-called “correctors” , which are loops of the PISO algorithm, to compute a Laplace equation for pressure correction.",
    "Sub- sequently, new values for the momentum are calculated.",
    "In addition, for every time step, there are “outer correctors” corresponding to loops of the transient-SIMPLE 123 5 Data Generation algorithm.",
    "In these corrector steps, also the mass flux across the faces of the finite volumes is updated.",
    "For every time step, several outer corrections were computed until a specified initial residual of 1 ×10−6was reached for pressure, velocity, and temperature.",
    "Usually, 10 to 50 outer correctors are necessary to achieve this min- imum tolerance.",
    "Each of these transient-SIMPLE loops triggered two PISO loops.",
    "This algorithm was computationally more expensive than each algorithm by itself (about a factor of two compared to PISO, which needed more iterations of the lin- ear equation solvers).",
    "However, the PIMPLE scheme results in stable and accurate solutions.",
    "In this application, a solution for every time step was sought that provided good results up to frequencies in the range of Sr =40.",
    "Small time steps were necessary to achieve this.",
    "Time step size was determined by the CFL number which was fixed to CFL≤0.2.",
    "Larger CFL numbers lead to an overprediction of the amplitude of GNu, although the simulation runs stable.",
    "Using only the PISO algorithm, yielded good values for |GNu|and was computa- tionally less expensive.",
    "However, the mass flux was only updated once each time step and therefore “lagged” behind.",
    "This lag leads to overpredicted values at high frequencies in GNuor necessitates much smaller time steps.",
    "Spatial gradients and divergence terms were approximated using a central differ- ence scheme (termed “linear” in OpenFOAM) that is second order in space.",
    "An unbounded, second order, conservative scheme (named “corrected”) was used for Laplacian terms and surface normal gradients are calculated with explicit non- orthogonal correction (named “corrected”).",
    "As the temporal scheme, a second order approximation was chosen using three time levels calculating present values from two previous time instants.",
    "For the first time step, the implicit Euler scheme (Ferziger and Peri´ c, 2002) was used.",
    "The size of each time step was evaluated with the calculated velocities forcing the maximum CFL number to CFL max≤0.2.",
    "The maximum time between two instances was limited to ∆t=5×10−3, even if the CFL number was CFL max<0.2.",
    "This ensured a specified minimum temporal resolution for the highest frequency.",

    "To achieve the desired value for Re 0, given an unperturbed inlet velocity and a cylinder diameter, the kinematic viscosity νwas set accordingly.",
    "At least two seconds were simulated using the finite volume approach.",

    "It would have been possible, of course, to use more sectors and thus analyze the circumferential variation of heat transfer dynamics in more detail.",
    "However, with four sectors, a good compromise between the level of detail and ease of presentation is achieved.",

    "A better resolution can be achieved by appending the last value of the times series (the new steady-state value) multiple times.",
    "This is allowed as the value should not change as long as the input is constant.",
    "A discrete Fourier transform of the Heaviside step function, however, leads to zeros at certain frequencies in the transformed quantity.",
    "This is not desirable because at these frequencies the computation of the frequency response is inaccurate or fails completely.",
    "Therefore, this method was rejected as well.",
    "The step response h[k] is the integral of the impulse response g[k].",
    "Hence, the im- pulse response can be computed from the step response data with finite differences given by g[k]=h[k]−h[k−1] Ts.",

    "Mathematically, this corresponds to the application of the Z-transform on the computed data.",
    "This method is straightforward, but the FIR model has cer- tain disadvantages like a large number of coefficients depending on the time step size.",
    "Thus, method (3) was also rejected in favor of method (4).",
    "The most promising procedure to acquire a transfer function from step response data is detailed in the following.",
    "Data Preparation The time series data was acquired from the simulation as described in Section 5.2.3.",
    "The computations were performed with variable time step to ensure a constant CFL number.",
    "These time steps are usually much smaller than the desired maximum fre- quency to ensure a certain smoothness of the signals.",
    "For further processing, the time series were linearly interpolated to a constant sampling time step equivalent to the smallest time step of the simulation.",
    "This occurs at rates much higher than the range of interest where the PSD of the signal is low.",
    "Hence, the information loss and the aliasing introduced by the interpolation are minimal.",
    "Subsequently, an anti-aliasing filter was applied to the time series, and they are downsampled to a bandwidth Strouhal number Sr =240.",
    "This is still six times higher than the maximum frequency of interest, but the amount of data is reduced considerably.",
    "Frequency Response At first, the impulse response was computed from the step response data using Equation (6.6).",
    "The final steady-state value, which is zero in the case of a BIBO stable system such as the one at hand, was appended to the original time series to enhance the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform in the consecutive step.",
    "To acquire a frequency response, it is only necessary to compute the Fourier transform of the impulse response.",
    "The Fourier transform of the unit impulse is unity, i.e.",
    "it is the neutral element in frequency space, and a frequency-wise division like in the case of the step response is not required.",
    "This avoids the problem arising in the ill-conditioned computation of the frequency response directly from the step response.",
    "The frequency response computed from step response data is shown in Figure 6.5 for the heat transfer pulsations caused by velocity pulsations and in Figure 6.6 for the skin friction as solid lines.",
    "For comparison, the frequency response of the trans- fer function computed in Section 6.3 are included as dashed lines.",

    "Subsequently, the transfer function is validated, i.e.",
    "the model quality is assessed.",
    "The best model for each mean flow Reynolds number Re 0is reported in Section 6.4.",
    "The CFD/SI approach allows to determine the response function over a wide fre- quency range using data from a single CFD simulation with broadband excitation.",
    "In contrast, the FFT approach, based on forcing with a single frequency, requires one simulation per frequency.",
    "Other types of signals, e.g.",
    "sums of sinusoids, chirps, or sawtooth signals, have also been used in the past but did not perform as effi- ciently as broadband noise.",
    "This is due to the fact that the latter provides high and constant power spectral density over all frequencies of interest.",
    "Hence, the excita- tion is persistent and limited in amplitude (Tangirala, 2014).",
    "Moreover, different signal time series can be designed to be decorrelated.",
    "This allows extending the available time series for identification by simply concatenating the series of two separate experiments or simulations.",
    "For the identification with multiple inputs (MISO or MIMO systems), decorrelated excitation signals allow the SI procedure to distinguish between the inputs.",
    "Numerous SI procedures and auxiliary tools are implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., 2016).",
    "The CFD/SI procedure can be divided into five main steps: After an input signal is created with the desired properties and the solver is set up to give an accurate representation of the underlying physics, this signal is used in the CFD simulation.",
    "During the computation, time advances and time series are acquired at every time step.",
    "These time series are used for parameter estimation and 158 6.3 CFD/SI for validation.",
    "This data is processed and eventually fed to the identification rou- tine.",

    "Depending on whether the full cylinder or only parts of it should be analyzed, the data of the individual sectors were combined as desired.",
    "All time series were recorded with variable time steps as the simulation was set to keep the CFL number constant to a specific maximum value (CFL max≤0.2).",
    "To achieve a constant sampling time, necessary for the identification procedure, the data were linearly interpolated to a constant sampling time step corresponding to the smallest time increment in the simulation.",
    "The PSD at frequencies associated with the smallest time step is low and hence the aliasing introduced by the interpolation is negligible.",
    "Subsequently, the data is filtered and down-sampled to a larger sampling time Ts.",
    "A general guideline to choose the Tsin practice is about 20 to 40 samples in one settling time cτ, where cτis the dominant time constant or the time constant of a first order approximation of the system (Åström and Wittenmark, 1997, Chapter 2).",
    "For cτ=0.2 (Lighthill, 1954), this leads to Ts=0.005−0.01.",
    "In this thesis, Ts= 0.01309 was chosen, which yields a Nyquist frequency of Sr Nyquist =240 six times higher than the frequency of interest.",
    "In the step response simulations, a rise time ofcτ=0.2378 for a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0=40 was found.",
    "This result confirms the choice of sampling time.",

    "Following this path proved to be successful for Re 0≤40.",
    "The second method reported in this chapter was processed the frequency response data from the LNSE simulations.",
    "The identification of a continuous time transfer function from the acquired data yields results with a very good fit to the raw data.",
    "The identification requires only a small amount of data preparation.",
    "Together with the efficiency of the (incompressible) LNSE approach, this is the quickest way to de- velop transfer functions for Re 0≤40.",
    "However, this approach, like the step response method, fails to deliver acceptable results when vortex shedding occurs due to the fact that a true steady-state solution is required.",
    "Using a time or cycle average in- stead of a steady-state solution might be possible together with further adjustments, but no acceptable results could be achieved in due time.",
    "The CFD/SI method, was the third method.",
    "It used time domain data generated with broadband excitation and subsequently, a transfer function was developed.",
    "Two different identification approaches were considered.",
    "Continuous time identification uses the time domain data transformed into fre- quency space to directly develop a continuous time transfer function.",
    "The identi- fication method is basically the same as in the LNSE approach, but the frequency domain data, acquired using FFT, is not as good-natured as the frequency response data from the LNSE.",
    "The results showed the best agreement with the simulated data in cross-validation tests for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0≤40.",
    "The VF identifi- cation method can be used on data with Re 0>40, i.e.",
    "data contaminated by tonal or turbulent noise.",
    "However, noise in discrete time domain data cannot be handled by the VF approach, and hence it competes with the OE model identification but yields inferior results compared to a BJ model in the presence of intense or strongly colored disturbances.",
    "Discrete time identification in the framework of the CFD/SI approach proved to be the most versatile method.",
    "The identification of OE models from time domain data yielded excellent results.",
    "The time series acquired from a CFD simulation with broadband excitation can be used directly with very little pre-processing (resam- pling and linearization).",
    "Theoretically, the OE model identification can find the transfer function of the deterministic part even in the presence of higher noise 195 6 Transfer Function Identification levels.",
    "Transformation to a continuous time transfer function is facilitated through bilinear transform.",
    "The BJ model is an OE model with parametrization of the noise and, hence, basically an extension when noise handling, e.g.",
    "in the cases with Re0>40, is necessary.",
    "Step excitation and simulation in the frequency domain are unsuited to develop transfer functions in the presence of tonal or broadband noise.",
    "The excitation of the system with only one single step, which is superimposed by disturbances, is not enough to separate the deterministic response from the stochastic noise.",
    "Hence, the true step response cannot be inferred like in the case of laminar flow (cf.",
    "Sec- tion 6.1).",
    "This was also shown by Cabrera  for the case of Re 0=3900.",
    "Moreover, a single step excitation is also only of limited avail in determining step response characteristics like steady-state gain, rise time, and overshoot (cf.",
    "Section 6.1.3).",
    "Similar reasoning holds for tonal noise.",
    "No technique exists to distinguish between an overshoot or oscillations of the step response and the sinusoidal disturbance of the tonal noise.",
    "A clear distinction between deterministic system and noise would only be possible if several steps are used and the noise contribution cancels to zero across all steps due to its nature.",
    "This already leads to the principle of persistent excitation which is the idea behind broadband excitation in conjunction with SI.",
    "In the scope of tonal noise or turbulent noise, the LNSE approach is an interesting method.",
    "Both tonal noise originating from vortex shedding and broadband noise from turbulence are transient phenomena.",
    "To be represented in the model, these effects have to be included in the solution the linearization is based upon, i.e.",
    "the “steady-state” solution.",
    "Hence, instead of a true steady-state solution, which can only be found for Re 0.40, an averaged solution may be computed.",
    "In the presence of tonal noise, a cycle-average may be used at this point.",
    "This would allow simulat- ing a frequency response giving credit to the noise through the averaged solution.",
    "A transfer function can be identified from this response at discrete frequencies with- out a noise model.",
    "However, in the case of the flow around a cylinder, it was not possible to compute an averaged solution that allowed for a stable solution of the linearized equations.",
    "Some stabilization technique might represent a remedy for this numerical instability, but it was not within the scope of this thesis.",
    "Moreover, in order to treat turbulent flow with this method, the LNSE solver would have to be extended to three spatial dimensions and probably a model for the turbulence.",
    "To conclude the capabilities of each identification method in the presence of tonal or broadband noise, only OE, BJ, and the VF method remain.",
    "BJ is suited best be- cause of the possibility to combine a low order model for the deterministic transfer function with a noise model of rather high order that is able to reproduce the char- acteristics of the tonal noise or broadband noise.",

    "Bayly’s model matches well with the identified frequency response at low Reynolds numbers.",
    "The relation given by Bayly  yields fair results up to Re =0.1 (as shown in the figure as dashed lines) but should not be used for mean flow Reynolds numbers above Re =0.5.",
    "Lighthill  stated that his model is applicable if a laminar boundary layer exists and gave Re >10 as a limit.",
    "This is due to the fact that the boundary layer equations used by Lighthill  make use of the limiting process Re → ∞ .",
    "Indeed, the iden- tified frequency response at Re 0=40 shows very similar low and high-frequency limits in the amplitude.",
    "Lighthill’s time constant cτ=0.2, however, is considerably smaller than the dominant time scale in the Re 0=40 case from SI ( cτ≈0.3).",

    "Figure 6.26) or from the step response at t→ ∞ (cf.",

    "The red spot close to the side of the cylinder relative to the flow marks noticeably higher velocities in proximity to the surface.",
    "A gray color directly at the cylinder boundary indicates no change, which reflects the fact that the no-slip con- dition is imposed.",
    "The flow field relaxes to the new steady state over time, to some extent reversing the sudden changes.",
    "The drastic change instantly after the step input is due to the immediate high pres- sure gradient establishing to facilitate the acceleration of the flow.",
    "This favorable pressure gradient is responsible for large velocity gradients in proximity to the cylin- der.",
    "Another way to interpret this is an increased generation of vorticity at the cylin- der, which is subsequently transported by convection and diffusion.",
    "A new, thinner, thermal boundary layer establishes after the step excitation, and hot fluid in proximity to the cylinder is swept away.",
    "This is indicated by the comparably cooler (blue) region that forms at the windward side of the cylinder and spreads further downstream at later instances in time.",
    "This cooler region shows that there is a higher temperature gradient at the cylinder, resulting in a rise in heat transfer rate.",
    "In addition, a hotter zone is initially forming at the lee side of the cylinder over a time of approximately one passage time.",
    "Eventually, it is swept away downstream with the flow, and the temperature at the backward stagnation point of the cylinder is also slightly lower than before the perturbation.",
    "This is in accordance with the step response behavior of sector 4 as shown in Figure 6.2.",
    "The appearance of this hot zone is visible as a drop below the original steady-state value shortly after the step input occurred.",
    "The hotter fluid starts to move downstream between t=0.7 and t=1.5.",
    "7.2.2 Behavior at Different Mean Flow Reynolds Numbers Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5 show the flow fields for Re 0=0.4.",
    "At this low Reynolds number, the flow fields are in transition for a long time, and a new steady state is not reached at the end of the figure series, although the last flow field was captured 25 flow passage times after the step occurred.",
    "This can also be seen in Figure 6.1.",
    "However, the cold leeward zone and the hot windward zone can readily be detected.",
    "Also, the sudden change of the velocity field restores slightly and within a compara- bly large amount of time until the new steady state is reached.",
    "In the case of Re 0=4 (Figure 7.6 and Figure 7.7), gradients are much stronger and cold and hot zones are more pronounced.",

    "The development of the cold zone is partially counteracted and it reaches its maximum after about t≈7 (Figure 7.7, second row).",
    "The change in heat transfer rate slows down towards the new steady-state value but still overshoots it.",
    "After t≈2, the hot zone visible in the third row in Figure 7.6 departs.",
    "This corresponds to the positive values that are assumed in the heat transfer step response of sector 4 (cf.",
    "Figure 6.2 (b)).",
    "The step response flow field of a cylinder in crossflow with an initial Reynolds number of Re 0=40 (Figure 7.8 and Figure 7.9) shows a slightly different behavior.",

    "Only a small section at the cylinder, close to the flow separation point, remains colored in gray indicating no change.",
    "Again, the pressure gradient necessary to accelerate the flow affects the boundary layer.",
    "The adverse pressure gradient due to the curvature is counteracted by the favorable pressure gradient from the step input.",
    "This causes the separation point, where the flow cannot longer follow the curvature of the cylinder and the recircu- lation zone starts, to shift towards the rearward stagnation point.",
    "The recirculation zone seems to collapse and is restored when the excess of vorticity is transported downstream.",
    "The size of the colder and hotter zones are smaller than in the case of Re 0=0.4 and Re0=4, similar o the steady-state boundary field visible in Figure 7.3.",
    "Gradients are stronger (different color scales are used) and changes are faster, e.g.",
    "happen in shorter succession to the step input than at lower mean flow Reynolds numbers.",

    "A Strouhal number of Sr =0.01 was cho- sen to approximate a quasi-steady state.",
    "A major outcome is that the temperature fluctuations are strong for Sr ≤0.5.",
    "At Strouhal numbers of Sr =0.01 and Sr =0.1, the amplitude of Θ1assumes large values upwind of the cylinder visible as red areas.",
    "The fluctuations at values greater than Sr >0.5 are comparably weak.",

    "at Sr =40, the generation of vorticity fluctuations is much stronger than at low Strouhal numbers.",
    "The dynamic boundary layer thickness is small, and hence the velocity gradients are large.",

    "Again, the highest value ( |ζ1|max=81.0) is measured at Sr=40.",
    "A major difference to the behavior at the lower mean flow Reynolds numbers is the occurrence of high amplitude fluctuations downstream of the cylinder and in the shear layer next to the recirculation zone.",
    "The recirculation zone is visible as the closed streamline at the lee side of the cylinder.",
    "The temperature fluctuations in front of the cylinder are comparable in amplitude to the Re 0=4 case.",

    "They are a direct result of the surface normal gradients in the LNSE flow fields at certain Strouhal numbers.",
    "All of these representations shed light on the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer and the skin friction as well as the distinct features of the respective transfer functions.",
    "228 7.5 Discussion Deviations from models reported previously, especially the model by Lighthill , can be physically motivated and explained.",
    "Most notably, the peak gain phenomenon and the phase lag in the heat transfer as well as the low-frequency behavior of the skin friction.",
    "The latter is very uniquely linked in its time scales to the cylindrical shape.",
    "In the light of these investigations, the analytical approach by Lighthill (1954, cf.",
    "Section 3.2.2) can be reassessed.",
    "In short, Lighthill’s assumptions and simplifica- tions can be summarized as follows: (1) The boundary layer equations were used to describe the flow.",
    "Lighthill  then treated these equations differently for the limit of low and high frequencies.",
    "He later identified Sr =20 as the frequency where both limiting solutions approximately matched for the skin friction.",
    "(2) High frequencies were assessed using the solution of Stokes’ second problem (Stokes, 1851, cf.",
    "Section 3.1.2).",
    "(3) For low frequencies, the term including the frequency parameter (Strouhal number) could not be assumed small, and hence, simplifica- tions similar to those made by Stokes were not possible.",
    "Instead, Lighthill used an integral Kármán–Polhausen treatment (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006).",
    "(4) The parameters for the fourth order polynomial profiles were taken from solutions for the flat plate boundary layer (Blasius layer) and the stagnation point flow (Hiemenz layer) (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006).",
    "From the steady-state flow fields depicted in Section 7.1, it already becomes evi- dent that the notion of a boundary layer (assumption 1) does not apply to the flow around a cylinder with mean flow Reynolds numbers of Re 0=0.4 and Re 0=4 (Fig- ure 7.1 and Figure 7.2, respectively).",
    "Even at Re 0=40, the zone disturbed by the flow is not only a thin layer (Figure 7.3).",
    "Lighthill  stated that his approximate solution should be valid above Re 0>10, but this limit has to be raised in the light of this investigation.",
    "This is noteworthy inasmuch as most Rijke tubes operate at mean flow Reynolds numbers below Re 0<40 (cf.",
    "Table 3.1).",
    "Lighthill  built his model on the observation that the major part of the heat transfer occurs in the front quadrant of the cylinder (assumption 4).",
    "The findings in this thesis confirm this also for the fluctuations and even for lower Reynolds num- bers.",
    "However, still a significant part of the heat transfer occurs at angles φ>π/4.",
    "This also points to one of the main limitations in any study using the boundary layer equations to describe the flow (assumption 1).",
    "The heat transfer at the lee side of the cylinder (sector 4 at angles φ>3π/4) is not negligible and has a different phase than the windward part of the cylinder (cf.",
    "Fig- ure 7.20 and Figure 7.21).",
    "It causes the theoretical phase limit of ∠GNu> −π/2 at Sr→ ∞ predicted by Lighthill  never to be reached.",
    "Using Stokes’ solution for the high frequency behavior cannot represent this as Stokes developed it for a flat plate (assumption 2).",
    "Also, the low frequency approximation, which is a first order time lag system, has the same theoretical limit of ∠GNu(Sr→ ∞ )= −π/2 and can- 229 7 Flow Field Representations not represent this phenomenon.",
    "For the skin friction at high frequencies, however, Stokes’ second problem (cf.",
    "Section 3.1.2) is a good approximation even for curved geometries like the cylinder.",
    "Föller and Polifke  also reported that the limiting frequency was above ∠GNu> −π/2.",
    "However, the recirculation zone, as proposed by Föller and Polifke , can now be ruled out as a cause for this difference in phase because no recirculation occurs at Re 0=4.",
    "The enlarged phase limit occurs predominately at low mean flow Reynolds numbers.",
    "Inspecting the solution by Bayly , which specifically treats Re 0<1, reveals also phase values above ∠GNu> −π/2 at high Strouhal numbers.",

    "If the temperature at the surface of the cylinder is substantially different from the flow temperature, the fluid parameters are not constant and lead to a dif- ferent dynamic behavior.",
    "The small temperature difference assumption, introduced for most computations in this thesis, allowed to reduce the complexity of the CFD simulations and to compare the results with other studies.",

    "The fluid close to the cylinder heats up substantially, resulting in a higher viscosity.",

    "Three different shortcomings of this approach have been addressed: Different Prandtl numbers, variable fluid properties in conjunction with large temperature differences, and high pulsation amplitudes.",
    "It was shown that the Prandtl number has a much weaker impact on the frequency response than the Reynolds number and can readily be omitted from the parametrization.",
    "Moreover, although the temperature difference between the free-stream and the surface of the cylinder has some influence on the dynamic behavior, it does not change it fun- damentally and may be corrected with simple measures, e.g.",

    "249 9 Aspects of Applications Low Mach Number As can be seen from the Rayleigh Index in Figure 9.4, the transfer of thermal energy to acoustic energy is strongest at Strouhal numbers of order one for typical mean flow Reynolds numbers (0.1 ≤Re0≤40).",
    "With the relationship between Mach num- ber and Strouhal number given in Equation (9.1), the Mach number under these conditions is Ma≈πd L. (9.11) Usually, the wire diameter dis about three orders of magnitude smaller than the length of the resonator tube L. Hence, the Mach number is of order 10−3, and the assumption of low Mach numbers is justified.",
    "Low Helmholtz Number In the case of a Rijke tube, the speed of sound is much larger than the free-stream velocity.",
    "Therefore, the Mach number is of order 10−3.",
    "Indeed, even for moderate Strouhal numbers (Sr <40 in the present study) the Helmholtz number is also small He =SrMa ≪1.",
    "Thus, the region of heat transfer is “acoustically compact” , i.e.",
    "its length is much smaller than the acoustic wavelength (Rienstra and Hirschberg, 2015; Telionis, 1981).",
    "This implies that an incompressible flow model is adequate.",

    "Overheating The influence of the temperature difference (or overheating) ∆Tis neglected in this work to ensure comparability to analytical methods.",
    "The influence in the steady state can be estimated from the correction factor of Nußelt number correlations.",
    "Collis and Williams  (cf.",
    "Equation (2.23)) gave the correction factor (Tm/T∞)0.17, where Tmstands for the arithmetic mean between the temperature 250 9.1 Rijke Tube of the cylinder and the inbound fluid with T∞.",
    "This factor accounts for the tem- perature dependence of fluid properties like viscosity and thermal conductivity.",
    "It can be rewritten as [1 +∆T/(2T∞)]0.17indicating that low temperature differences between fluid and cylinder have negligible effect on the Nußelt number, e.g.",
    "for wire temperatures of ∆T=200K above a fluid temperature of T∞=300K this term enlarges the Nußelt number by only 5% and less than 11% for ∆T=500K.",
    "In the correlation by Sparrow et al.",

    "Equation (2.24)), the correction fac- tor is ( µ/µw)1/4.",
    "The temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity is given by Sutherland’s law (Equation (2.33)).",
    "This results in a Nußelt number reduced by 8.8 % for∆T=300K and 15.5 % for ∆T=500K at an ambient temperature of 300 K. Constant Wall Temperature Heat conduction in the cylinder was not resolved.",
    "Instead, a constant temperature Twon the surface of the cylinder was assumed.",
    "This assumption is also justified for Rijke tubes (Gelbert et al., 2012; Subramanian et al., 2010).",
    "A lumped thermal capacitance model (Baehr and Stephan, 2011; Bergman et al., 2011) is applicable, if the Biot number is much smaller than one Bi ≪1.",

    "In the Rijke tube, another factor comes into play.",
    "No net flux of fluid can occur in the direction perpendicular to the tube axis, i.e.",
    "it cannot penetrate the solid tube material.",
    "Hence, mixed convection effects are neglected in this thesis.",

    "Nevertheless, Kopitz  showed, that radiative heat transfer it not negligible concerning the overall heat transfer in the Rijke tube.",
    "In his experiments, there was significant energy exchange between the heater and the tube wall.",
    "This impeded temperature measurements and caused heat-up of the whole tube.",

    "Thus, this method causes the following limitations.",
    "Overheating In a real Rijke tube, a certain amount of thermal power has to be introduced in order to overcome the hydraulic losses and achieve a limit cycle.",
    "Hence, the temperature of the wire has to be substantially higher than the ambient temperature.",
    "The as- sumption of low temperature differences is violated.",
    "It was, however, established in Section 8.3.2 that the dynamic behavior does not change fundamentally and some correction, e.g.",
    "the use of an effective mean flow Reynolds number, copes with this shortcoming.",
    "High Amplitudes The linear regime only describes the onset of thermoacoustic oscillations in the Rijke tube.",
    "At higher amplitudes, the nonlinearity of the heat transfer plays an im- 253 9 Aspects of Applications portant role, but it cannot be handled accurately by a linear model.",
    "Nevertheless, as shown in Section 8.3.3, the dynamics are still represented adequately to some extent even at pulsation amplitudes in the order of the mean flow velocity.",
    "Non-Uniformity A constant velocity profile is used in the CFD computations for a single wire.",
    "How- ever, in the resonator tube, a boundary layer will establish, leading to a character- istic velocity profile.",
    "This is not so much of concern for a single wire, because the wire diameter is usually much smaller than the tube diameter d≪D.",
    "Yet, different wires placed at a different distance from the cylinder axis experience different mean flow velocities and therefore locally different Reynolds numbers and Strouhal num- bers.",
    "Moreover, oscillations in the Rijke tube do not only scale the velocity profile in the tube but also interact with the boundary layer at the tube wall and introduce additional dynamics.",
    "Wire Pattern As the last limitation, the isolated wire has to be mentioned.",
    "To introduce the nec- essary amount of thermal energy, the heated wire has to be inserted in the tube as a coil or some sort of repeating pattern.",
    "This also means that the wires interact with each other.",
    "If the distance of the wires in lateral direction is large enough, however, this interaction is negligible.",
    "Usually, this distance is several wire diameters and fulfilling the far field requirement.",
    "A different picture can be drawn in the case of successive wires where one wire is in the (thermal) wake of the other.",
    "A simulation was conducted at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0=3 with two successive wires at a distance of 10 d. The transfer function of the second wire was of the same shape as that of the first, but the amplitude values were about 10% to 20% smaller.",

    "In the first method, changes in the wire temperature lead to changes in electrical resistance.",

    "It poses a difficulty in the data acquisition as the signal imposed at the inlet decouples.",
    "Two changes were implemented in the computa- tional procedure to minimize this effect: The domain boundary was chosen circular so with any inflow angle the face normals of the inlet point towards the cylinder.",
    "The second change concerned the position of the data acquisition plane.",
    "It was located as close to the cylinder as possible to acquire the actual input accurately.",
    "Velocity fluctuations, i.e.",
    "Reynolds number fluctuations, and fluctuations in the an- gle of attack influence the heat transfer.",
    "Hence, the system is of MISO type, and an according model had to be identified.",

    "The dynamic influence of Reynolds number fluctuations on Nußelt number fluctuations GReis expected to be the same as GNuin Section 6.3.",
    "The transfer behavior between the angle of attack and the Nußelt number Gαshows a low gain at high frequencies where the boundary layer cannot adapt to the fast changes in the flow.",
    "In the quasi- steady limit, the adaption occurs instantly, and no change in heat transfer occurs.",
    "However, at reasonably low frequencies changes in the boundary layer affect the Nußelt number.",
    "The relative influence of both fluctuations, Reynolds number fluctuations and fluc- tuations in the angle of attack, is determined by standardization of all quantities.",
    "From the standardized transfer functions conclusions can be drawn on how much of the variance in Nußelt number is explained by either Re′orα′.",

    "Peak and drop in the gain of GReare well beyond the operating range of the controller for very thin wires.",
    "The influence of the angle of attack is negligible in the low-frequency limit.",
    "The boundary layer adapts to slow changes in the angle of attack comparably fast and therefore the gain is zero.",
    "The influence of the angle of attack becomes stronger towards the cutoff frequency of the controller.",
    "The rise in gain is about one order of magnitude.",
    "This effect would even be stronger if thicker wires were considered and the peak gain of Gαis in the pass-band of the controller.",
    "Towards even higher frequencies, the inertia of the fluid leads to a band-pass-like behavior as visible in Figure 9.7.",
    "The comparison between the frequency ranges of the wire and the CTA controller with the frequency responses of the heat transfer fluctuations to pulsations in ap- proaching flow velocity and angle of attack shows that anemometers operate mostly in the quasi-steady limit.",
    "Hence, the heat transfer dynamics play only a minor role.",

    "Recently, the effect of an HX on thermoacoustic combustion instabilities in a heating system was investigated by Surendran and Heckl (2014, 2015).",
    "In these studies, the so-called n−τmodel was used to describe unsteady heat transfer.",
    "This model corresponds to the low- frequency limit of Lighthill’s results for heat transfer in pulsating crossflow: A charac- teristic time delay τleads to a linearly growing phase lag in the frequency response.",
    "This approach is simple and quite popular but does not give a realistic description of the dynamics.",
    "The HX in crossflow itself is much like the configuration investigated in this thesis, in particular, a low-pass behavior is obtained.",
    "However, the interactions between consecutive elements of an HX have a significant impact on its response function (Strobio Chen et al., 2015).",
    "Combinations of HX and flames, as found in configura- tions of applied interest, were investigated with respect to the dynamic heat transfer behavior from a hydrodynamic and thermoacoustic point of view by Hosseini et al.",
    "(2014b,a) and from a system point of view by Strobio Chen et al.",
    "(Strobio Chen et al., 2016).",
    "Surendran et al.",
    "determined the frequency response function of the HX in this configuration from the discrete Fourier transform of the response of the 259 9 Aspects of Applications heat transfer rate to a step input, which was determined by numerical simulation.",
    "The HX is principally very similar to the (isolated) cylinder assessed in this thesis.",
    "However, some differences arise, which are addressed in the following.",
    "9.3.1 Temperature Difference The temperature difference between inflow and outflow of the HX and the resulting change in fluid properties play an important role in quantifying the dynamic be- havior.",
    "The qualitative behavior, however, is very similar to the heated cylinder.",
    "The most substantial difference is the arrangement.",
    "In the case of the cylinder, one bluff body is singled out surrounded by a theoretically infinite amount of fluid.",
    "The HX, in contrast, consists of tightly wound coils with only small clearances between the exchanger pipes.",
    "A specifically determined amount of fluid passes through, trans- ferring its excess in enthalpy to the fluid in the exchanger tubes.",
    "This especially impacts the quasi-steady behavior, i.e.",
    "the low-frequency limit.",
    "9.3.2 Low Frequency Limit Heat transfer between a surface and a convective flow can be described by Newton’s law of cooling (Bergman et al., 2011) given by q̇=h(Tw−T∞).",
    "(9.22) In the isolated wire configuration (Rijke tube) addressed in this thesis, the enthalpy change of the flow is insignificant.",
    "Both temperatures Twand T∞are constant.",
    "The low-frequency limit is determined by the heat transfer coefficient h, i.e.",
    "the Nußelt number.",
    "This is different in the case of the HX.",
    "The initially large temperature differ- ence ( Tw−T∞) between HX surface and passing flow diminishes along the exhaust gas path until it almost vanishes.",
    "This is necessary to achieve high efficiencies.",
    "The low-frequency limit, in this case, is controlled by the enthalpy difference rather than the heat transfer.",
    "The heat transferred in the HX is given by q̇=uρcp(Tu−Td) (9.23) where Tuand Tdare the fluid temperatures upstream and downstream of the HX.",
    "Asymptotic expansion of velocity u, downstream temperature Td, and density ρ yields q̇0+ϵq̇′=cp(u0+ϵu′)(ρ0+ϵρ′)(︁ Tu−(Td,0+ϵT′ d))︁ .",

    "Two of which are the improvement of exist- ing devices and the development of new technologies with high potentiality.",
    "This thesis strives to aid this process through the following findings.",
    "10.1 Summary The dynamic response of the heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsat- ing crossflow were investigated for small perturbations of flow velocity.",
    "The cycle- averaged heat transfer is independent of the fluctuations such that pulsations of flow variables can be described as LTI systems.",
    "The foundation of this study was time series data acquired from CFD simulations of a single cylinder in crossflow solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.",
    "The assumptions leading to this simplified treatment are justified for the application that was the primary mo- tivation for this thesis: the Rijke tube.",
    "The numerical procedure was designed and examined thoroughly to yield optimal results regarding the desired dynamic behav- ior.",
    "The dynamic behavior was quantified by transfer functions.",
    "These are models in the framework of LTI systems known from control theory and electrical engineer- ing.",
    "Three fundamentally different ways—with the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations as the only commonality—were implemented and compared.",
    "Transfer functions were developed from the response to a sudden rise in input velocity (step response), from a frequency domain approach, where perturbations are linearized and solved with finite differences (LNSE), and from time domain simulations with broadband excitation (CFD/SI).",
    "For the latter, discrete time identification and con- tinuous time identification were considered.",
    "The results are in excellent agreement for all simulation and identification methods for mean flow Reynolds numbers of Re0≤40.",
    "The CFD/SI approach offers more variability, as it does not rely on the existence of a steady state.",
    "Several improvements were easily possible such as the extension to the regime of vortex shedding and transition to turbulence in the wake Re0>40.",
    "Continuous time identification and discrete time identification yielded compara- ble results as long as disturbances were well-behaved.",
    "However, in the cases where 263 10 Conclusions and Outlook vortex shedding occurs, and a strong tonal component is present in the noise, the OE model structure from the discrete time framework can readily be extended to a BJ model with a parametrization of the disturbance.",
    "In addition to the assessment of model types and parameter estimation methods, other advanced identification techniques, e.g.",
    "regularization and uncertainty quantification, were surveyed.",
    "The results of the investigations were tabulated and depicted as Bode plots of the frequency responses.",
    "The heat transfer dynamics and the skin friction dynamics are governed by several time scales, corresponding to the response times of the velocity field and temperature field, respectively.",
    "The interaction of the different time lags leads to a non-trivial dependence of the respective frequency responses on Strouhal numbers and mean flow Reynolds numbers.",
    "The transfer behavior of the heat transfer appears like a low-pass filter with one dominant time scale, similar to the analytical predictions by Lighthill  or Bayly .",
    "However, several devia- tions from this behavior were found and explained, most notably the occurrence of a peak gain at 0 <Sr<1 and the phase values at very high frequencies.",
    "The skin fric- tion, in contrast, behaves like a high-pass filter.",
    "A strong dependence on the mean flow Reynolds number exists which is not present in the existing analytical models by Lighthill  and Gersten .",
    "Unification in the manner of a Reynolds analogy is not possible in the dynamic case.",
    "The present study represents also a significant advancement over previous computational studies (Apelt and Ledwich, 1979; Kwon and Lee, 1985; Nicoli and Pelcé, 1989; Payne, 1958; Föller et al., 2008).",
    "In particular, the time lag, which is of paramount importance for thermoacoustic stability in a Rijke tube, is determined with quantitative accuracy.",
    "The advantage of CFD simulations is complete access to the flow field at any instant in time.",
    "This is used to examine the evolution of the near field of the cylinder in unprecedented detail.",
    "Step response simulations and the results from the LNSE approach allow insight in the temporal development and the behavior in the fre- quency domain, respectively.",
    "This was also used to show detailed circumferential distributions of the Nußelt number fluctuations and friction coefficient fluctuations at different excitation frequencies.",
    "To make the results from this thesis readily available in tasks like the modeling of a Rijke tube, a first order parametrized model was developed.",
    "The model includes the dependence of the transfer behavior on Strouhal number and Reynolds number and can be used in the range 0.1 ≤Re0≤40 and 0 <Sr≤40.",
    "The steady-state gain and the time constant are given as correlations developed from the complete series of simulations in the regime without vortex shedding.",
    "Three applications are investigated in the scope of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow: The Rijke tube, hot-wire anemometry, and an HX as an acoustic element.",
    "Special consideration was given to the Rijke tube, and the transfer functions developed in this thesis were related to the stability of thermoacoustic oscillations in the tube.",
    "For 264 10.2 Implications for Further Research the hot-wire anemometer, an additional fact was investigated.",
    "A fluctuating angle of attack, which originates from turbulent fluctuations of the flow to be measured, has some impact on the heat transfer dynamics and therefore on the measurement.",
    "10.2 Implications for Further Research Further investigations will address gas turbines as well as the Rijke tube as a proto- type of a thermoacoustic device.",
    "Moreover, machinery exploiting the thermoacous- tic effect, e.g.",
    "thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators, will profit from the results and methods assessed in this study.",
    "Although high amplitudes, and therefore the nonlinear heat transfer dynamics, play a vital role in this type of device, linear stabil- ity (or instability) is still a primary design criterion.",
    "Thermoacoustic prime movers are of interest, e.g.",
    "for the power generation from waste heat (Witte et al., 2015).",
    "High efficiency is of secondary importance compared to acquisition costs and service costs.",
    "These devices are predestined for this task as they are simple to build and very robust in operation once they are adequately designed.",
    "This argument also applies to thermoacoustic refrigerators.",
    "They may be used where robustness is a crucial requirement as they can be built with no moving parts.",
    "This gives these devices an advantage over conventional compression refrigerators even though the latter offer much higher efficiencies.",
    "Recent investigations in thermoacoustic devices in- clude the possibilities to incorporate thermoacoustic prime movers or refrigerators in other assemblies.",
    "One aspect that has been studied in the past was the influence of mean flow inside the device (Holzinger et al., 2012, 2015).",
    "Such a configuration, in turn, is similar to the Rijke tube.",
    "Thermoacoustic devices are in need of much more robust design tools and smart concepts for integration in machinery that supplies heat or acoustic energy.",
    "Although linear models, such as those assessed in this study, offer a great deal of insight and the possibility to investigate linear stability, the nonlinear behavior has to be subject to further investigations.",
    "A system may be linearly stable but nonlinear or non-normal effects may trigger high amplitudes.",
    "Moreover, if high amplitudes are desired, linear models often seize to be valid and can at most predict the coarse behavior but usually fail to recover correct amplitudes or power output.",
    "Another application with cylinders subject to pulsating flow, which is of interest for future investigations is the total artificial lung (TAL).",
    "The TAL is a device still under development, and it aims to replace all functions of a human lung, i.e.",
    "to remove CO 2from blood and to supply it with oxygen (O 2).",
    "To achieve this, the (pulsatile) blood flow passes small tubes from which the mass transfer occurs.",
    "Lin et al.",
    "studied these mass transfer effects in a water tunnel at very low Reynolds numbers.",
    "Numerical investigations were carried out by Zierenberg et al.",
    "(2006, 2007, 5 ≤Re≤ 40,0.25 ≤Wo≤4,0.25 ≤A≤0.75,Sc =1000), Qamar et al.",
    "(2011, 0.33 <KC<1, 265 10 Conclusions and Outlook 0.5d<A<d, 5<Re<20), and Qamar et al.",
    "(2012, 0.2 ≤A≤0.6, 0.57 ≤KC≤2, Re=5,10).",
    "The flow conditions examined in these studies are not unlike to the range of interest in this thesis.",
    "The Reynolds numbers are in the range 1 ≤Re≤50 and the fluid is incompressible.",
    "The largest difference is the high Schmidt number (Sc=1000) which is much larger than the ratio of transport properties considered in this thesis which mainly focuses on air (Pr =0.7).",
    "Besides the cylinder, another archetypal problem in thermo-fluid dynamics is a sphere in crossflow.",
    "CFD/SI methods or the LNSE can be used to investigate the impact of pulsations on the skin friction and the heat transfer.",
    "The skin friction plays an important role in the movement of small spherical particles or droplets.",
    "The movement can be described by a force balance including effects like inertia, virtual mass, and fluid drag.",
    "The latter has a “history” that has to be considered due to the dynamics of the skin friction.",
    "This history force, often called Basset force, can be identified from numerical simulations in a similar manner as the friction coefficient.",
    "The major difference is the dependence on flow acceleration instead of velocity like in this thesis.",
    "The Basset force plays an important role in the case of continuous acceleration, e.g.",
    "under the influence of gravity or in the case of droplets oscillating in an acoustic field.",
    "Moreover, the heat transfer between a droplet and the surrounding fluid plays a role in the evaporation of liquid fuels, and the heat transfer dynamics can influence the spray combustion process.",
    "A topic explicitly excluded in this thesis are state space models.",
    "These models exist besides input–output models and have certain desirable properties, especially in conjunction with computational methods and systems with a large number of in- puts and outputs.",
    "The models reported in this thesis can easily be transformed into state space models.",
    "However, in the field of SI, useful methods like balanced trunca- tion model reduction and model order identification exist, which makes the direct identification of state space models an exciting topic for further investigations.",
    "This thesis offers detailed models for the behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow.",
    "Moreover, a comprehensive procedure is given to acquire accurate results at flow conditions not investigated in detail in this thesis.",
    "The reported results allow the development of models with different levels of detail in investigations, e.g.",
    "of the thermoacoustic effect in the Rijke tube.",
    "Findings con- cerning the field of thermoacoustic can be transferred to other devices.",
    "On the one hand to help suppress thermoacoustic instabilities and ensure proper performance, e.g.",
    "in the case of stationary gas turbines for power generation or in domestic boilers.",
    "On the other hand, the thermoacoustic effect may be used purposefully in devices, e.g.",
    "in thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators.",
    "The ultimate goal is to contribute to maintaining the standard of living that was granted by the devices mentioned above, while most importantly reducing the toll on the environment.",
    "Specifically, to reduce noxious emissions like NO xand small particles as well as greenhouse gases like CO 2.",
