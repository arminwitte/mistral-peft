Research in this area offers possibilities to achieve both objectives from the United Nations Summit: higher efficiency of existing technology and new approaches to energy conversion. Although known for about two centuries, this conversion mechanism has been neglected and came into focus again rather recently. The term thermoacoustics was coined to describe this effect which was first reported by Higgins (1802) and Rijke (1859). Higgins (1802) discovered that a hydrogen flame placed in a tube would emit sound. This setup is now known as the \u201csinging flame\u201d. Later a similar phenomenon was found by Rijke (1859) who was experimenting with a heated wire mesh inside a resonator tube.",

R and pref are constants and hence the density only depends on the temperature. This approximation has several consequences: Compression and expansion can only occur through changes in temperature. Small changes in local pressure and density are not coupled, and thus there is no wave propagation, and the speed of sound approaches infinity a \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, an isobaric temperature change will not result in a change in volume or density and thus cp = cv = c. This also implies \u03b3 = 1.

Though boundary conditions differ somewhat, the analogy remains reasonably accurate. When the Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are equal to one, certain relationships between friction coefficient, Reynolds number, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number hold. Reynolds' analogy provides a way to relate these parameters, but it's most accurate when the Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are near one and there's little pressure change. The Chilton-Colburn analogy is a more refined version that works for a broader range of Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, but only under favorable pressure conditions. If these conditions are met, the analogy can be used with average surface values."

    "input": "3.1.1 Thermoacoustics\nThe first experiments on pulsating flows in conjunction with heat release from combustion were carried out in the late 18th century by Higgins (1802). A hydrogen flame was observed to produce audible sound if confined in a suitable glass tube. The \u201csinging flame\u201d was seen as an amusement, but should prove to be a significant discovery concerning combustion instabilities occurring in rocket engines and modern gas turbines (Keller, 1995).\nIn pulsating or oscillating flow, heat transfer can damp, but also drive instabilities. The first observations of this thermoacoustic effect caused by heat transfer were reported by Sondhau\u00df (1850) and Rijke (1859). Sondhau\u00df (1850) described an effect experienced by glass blowers. In a heated glass bulb with a long neck, thermal energy is transformed into acoustic energy, which can be perceived as audible sound. This effect can be intensified by the use of a stack, a porous medium inside the neck, which extends the surface area (Swift, 2002, 2007). The important mechanisms for this self-sustaining oscillations take place in the boundary layer, which establishes in an oscillating flow at the solid surface. Kirchhoff (1868) described the influence of heat transfer on acoustic fields mathematically, and Rayleigh (1896) gave a widely accepted explanation for the thermoacoustic effect. A complete mathematical model of the Sondhau\u00df tube was given by Kramers (1949) and eventually improved significantly by Rott (1969).\nThe setup examined by Rijke (1859) is similar to the Sondhau\u00df tube. It also has a glass tube as the main corpus. As in the case of the Sondhau\u00df tube, the tube in Rijke\u2019s case serves as a resonator in which a standing wave exists. However, in this case, it is open at both ends. A heated wire mesh, placed in the lower half of the vertical tube induces a buoyancy driven mean flow. The heat transfer at the mesh responds dynamically to fluctuations in mean flow velocity so that the heat transfer and the standing wave pressure interact constructively.",

The use of a porous stack enhances this effect. Oscillations occur in the boundary layer near solid surfaces.

    "output": "Basset's work in 1888 introduced a formula describing the movement of a sphere within a thick fluid. This formula takes into account the sphere's acceleration and how the changing flow pattern impacts its current motion, leading to what is known as the Basset force. This force is calculated using an integral that considers the sphere's past accelerations, weighted by how long ago they occurred. This weighting factor decreases over time. The kernel represents how the sphere's surface friction responds to acceleration changes. Understanding the dynamics of skin friction is crucial for analyzing particle movement in sound fields or under forces like gravity. While the Basset force has been studied by various researchers since its initial development, this particular thesis will focus on the dynamics of skin friction but will not specifically address spherical geometries."

    "output": "Lighthill's 1954 paper, a significant work, explored how laminar skin friction and heat transfer respond to changes in the velocity of the flow. He simplified the Navier-Stokes equations using boundary layer approximations to develop estimated solutions for velocity and temperature near the wall, specifically for small oscillations. He then calculated the displacement thickness, skin friction, and heat flow. His analysis extended to a cylinder in crossflow at low Reynolds numbers, determining the heat transfer response in terms of amplitude and phase shift. Lighthill acknowledged that his findings are valid for Reynolds numbers greater than 10 and when a laminar boundary layer is present. He also suggested that the heat transfer rate's reaction to changes in free-stream velocity depends on how quickly the viscous and thermal boundary layers adjust. For periodic disturbances, this delay influences the heat transfer's frequency response phase. He estimated the low-frequency heat transfer lag as roughly one-fifth the ratio of cylinder diameter to free-stream velocity. Lighthill used a perturbation method, introducing slight oscillations around a stable average. He examined scenarios at high and low frequencies and used a K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u2013Polhausen integral treatment to solve the boundary layer equations, acknowledging the approximate nature of the results based on the assumptions used, like modeling the velocity profile with a fourth-order polynomial."

The heat transfer over a flat plate demonstrates a peak amplitude, distinguishing it from flow near stagnation points. While Gersten's series expansion addressed some limitations of Lighthill's integral approach, challenges persist when applied to cylinders, as wedge flow solutions fail to accurately represent cylinder curvature.

The results were presented graphically, showing how the Nu\u00dfelt number, drag, and friction changed over time. The Nu\u00dfelt number increased exponentially after the sudden jump, similar to a time lag in control systems. Drag quickly decreased before gradually returning to a steady value.

This is in accordance with Ljung (1999, p. 233) who regards continuous time white noise descriptions as delicate mathematical objects. He suggests dealing with hybrid models, where the noise is handled in discrete time. Nevertheless, Beygi and Dounavis (2012) reported an approach to include noise modeling using an instrumental variable method. In this thesis a purely discrete time point of view was adopted whenever disturbance or noise modeling was of importance.",

Although alternative methods exist, such as the instrumental variable method described by Beygi and Dounavis, this work primarily utilizes a discrete-time approach when modeling disturbances and noise."

In his introduction, Ljung (1999) even states that \u201cInferring models from observations and studying their properties is really what science is about.\u201d\nThe process of SI is very general and widely known in different fields such as electrical engineering, economy, and psychology. SI is used when processes are either too complex to gain insight using first principles, i.e. physical laws, or the calculation is too costly in terms of time or resources. Its goal is to obtain an efficient and accurate model for a process from acquired data. The properties of this model can be analyzed to get insight in the process, or the model may be used for further calculations.",

It uses a cost function V, defined as the sum of squared errors, to estimate parameters. By setting the derivative of V with respect to the coefficients to zero, we arrive at the normal equations, which can be solved to find the optimal parameter estimates. The solution can be directly computed using the inverse of a matrix involving the regressors, or alternatively using QR-factorization for improved numerical stability.

The frequency spectrum of the input can be predefined and hence also very high frequencies, possibly interfering with the convergence of the numerical procedure, are avoided.

This was achieved by solving the nonlinear equations sequentially.\nThe nonlinear equation system was solved by using an initial velocity, calculated from the potential equations (cf. Section 2.2.7), to evaluate the stream function. The derivative of the stream function was used as the velocity in the subsequent iteration. The vorticity generated at the surface of the cylinder to fulfill the no-slip condition was propagated. This procedure was repeated until changes in the solutionwere small compared to the initial change. Convergence was improved through the use of a relaxation factor. Figure 5.8 depicts a flow chart of the iterative procedure.\nThe temperature is not coupled with the other equations and could hence be calculated in a final step outside the iteration loop.\nThe change in vorticity normalized with the vorticity after the first iteration written as\n\u03c3 =\n\u2225\u03b6(i )\u2225\u2212\u2225\u03b6(i\u22121)\u2225\n\u2225\u03b6(1)\u2225\n(5.41)\nwas used as the convergence criterion.

    "input": "The first order equations are linear and can hence be solved efficiently by using the matrix left division function from MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., 2016, mldivide \u201c\\\u201d). The equations for stream function and vorticity are coupled, and they are hence collected in a single system matrix. For convenience also the temperature is induced. This is not strictly necessary and can also be calculated sequentially. The structure of the matrix can be depicted as\n[\nA\u03c8 B\u03c8\u03b6 0\nC\u03b6,\u03c8 A\u03b6 0\n0 0 A\u03b8\n]\n[\n\u03c8\n\u03b6\n\u0398\n] = \n[\n\u03c8\n\u03b6\n\u0398\n]\n\u03b4\u03a9\n. (5.43)\nThe finite difference stencil for the respective Equation (5.31) to (5.33) is included in A\u03c8, A\u03b6, and A\u0398. The submatrix B\u03c8,\u03b6 couples the vorticity with the stream function equations. In an analogous manner, the derivatives of the stream function (velocities) are coupled with the vorticity equation throughC\u03b6,\u03c8. \u03b4\u03a9denotes the boundary conditions. The terms iSr r 2 \u03b61 and iSr r 2\u03981 serve as source terms and are included through the diagonals in A\u03b6 and A\u0398.",

When dealing with linearized Navier-Stokes equations in the frequency domain, this is done in two steps. First, the wave's amplitude is defined in the boundary condition related to the stream function's periodic behavior. Second, the frequency, characterized by the Strouhal number, is incorporated into the system matrix and can be adjusted to control the excitation."
