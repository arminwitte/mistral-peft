Moreover, my thanks go to Anja Friedrich, Margitta Witte, and Manuela Witte who made sure that this thesis does not scare off the gentle reader outside the thermo-fluid dynamics world (at least not immediately). For regular transdepartmental exchange including caffeinated beverages I am grateful to Peter Holfelder and Volker Schneider. Complementing my tasks at the Thermo-Fluid Dynamics Group, I was teaching assistant to the Master’ s level course “Heat and Mass Transfer”. I perfectly enjoyed working with the numerous students who came to my exercise course, the supple- mentary course, and office hours. I would like to thank every student who made me think harder, and I hope they put to good use the things they learned I also had the opportunity to get to know a few students who were helping me with my work and explored interesting topics surrounding and scratching the scope of this thesis.

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Matthew Juniper who made it possible for me to visit his research group at the University of Cambridge and especially Alessandro Orchini and José Aguilar. I enjoyed the exchange and fruitful discus- sions. Of course, this thesis would not have been possible without the support of my par- ents Maria and Otto Baumgartner as well as my sister Julia Baumgartner for which I am deeply grateful. Most of all I would like to thank my wife, Susanne. She was with me all the way with valuable discussions and a keen eye for what is relevant despite her own thesis and despite much more important things like carrying a new life. iii Kurzfassung Untersucht wurde das dynamische Verhalten des Wärmeübergangs und der Wand- schubspannung eines Zylinders in pulsierender Querströmung für kleine Störun- gen der Strömungsgeschwindigkeit. In diesem Regime ist der zeitlich gemittelte Wärmeübergang konstant, und Fluktuationen von Strömungsvariablen können als lineares, zeitinvariantes System beschrieben werden. Es wurde ein großer Bereich von Reynolds-Zahlen 0.01 ≤ Re ≤ 3900 mit Schwerpunkt auf die Regime ohne Wirbe- lablösung untersucht (Re ≤ 40). Letztere sind besonders interessant für Anwendun- gen wie das Rijke-Rohr und die Hitzdrahtanemometrie. Methoden der Systemidentifikation in Kombination mit CFD-Simulation (CFD/SI) wurden zur Datengenerierung verwendet. Die Übertragungsfunktionen von Ge- schwindigkeitspulsationen zu Pulsationen in Wärmeübergang und Wandschub- spannung wurden mit drei verschiedenen Methoden bewertet: Anregung einer numerischen Simulation mit der Sprungfunktion, Breitbandanregung von CFD- Simulationen kombiniert mit linearer Systemidentifikation und Lösen der lineari- sierten Navier-Stokes-Gleichungen im Frequenzbereich. Für Untersuchungen bei unterkritischer Strömung wurden LES-Simulationen verwendet. Die Dynamik des Wärmeübergangs und der Wandschubspannung wird von meh- reren Zeitskalen bestimmt. Diese entsprechen den jeweiligen Reaktionszeiten des Geschwindigkeitsfeldes und des Temperaturfeldes. Es gibt jedoch keine einfache Analogie wie die Reynolds-Analogie für stationäre Strömungen. Die Wechselwir- kung der verschiedenen Zeitverzögerungen führt zu einer nicht trivialen Abhängig- keit der Frequenzantwort des Wärmeübergangs und der Wandschubspannung von Strouhal-Zahlen und Reynolds-Zahlen. In der Literatur verfügbare Modelle für das dynamische Verhalten von Wärmeübergang und Wandschubspannung stimmen nur bis zu einem gewissen Grad mit den simulierten Daten überein. Diese Arbeit liefert ein Meta-Modell niedriger Ordnung, das den Wärmeübergang bei Reynolds- Zahlen in der Größenordnung von 10 besonders gut abbildet. Quantitative Ergebnisse werden für einen großen Bereich von Reynolds-Zahlen und Strouhal-Zahlen angegeben. Andere möglicherweise relevante Parameter wie ab- solute Temperaturdifferenzen, temperaturabhängige Eigenschaften und hohe Am- plituden wurden nicht erschöpfend behandelt. Das sehr vielseitige Verfahren kann jedoch für weitere Untersuchungen in dieser Hinsicht adaptiert werden. iv Abstract The dynamic behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow for small perturbations of flow velocity was investigated. In this regime, the time-averaged heat transfer is constant, and fluctuations of flow variables can be described as linear, time-invariant dynamics. A wide range of Reynolds numbers 0.01 ≤ Re ≤ 3900 was studied with emphasis on the regimes without vortex shedding (Re ≤ 40). The latter are of particular interest for applications like the Rijke tube and hot-wire anemometry. Using system identification techniques in combination with CFD simulation (CFD/SI) for data generation, the transfer functions from velocity pulsations to pulsations in heat transfer and skin friction were assessed with three different methods: Step excitation of a numerical simulation, broadband excitation of CFD simulations combined with linear system identification, and solving the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in the frequency domain. For investigations in subcritical flow, LES simulations were used. The heat transfer and skin friction dynamics are governed by several time scales. These correspond to the respective response times of the velocity field and the tem- perature field. However, no simple analogy, like the Reynolds analogy for steady flow, exists. The interaction of the different time lags leads to a non-trivial depen- dence of the frequency response of heat transfer and skin friction on Strouhal num- bers and Reynolds numbers. Available analytical models for the dynamic behavior of skin friction and heat transfer match the simulated data only up to a point. This thesis provides a low-order meta-model, which excels at Reynolds numbers of order 10. Quantitative results are given for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and Strouhal numbers. Other possibly relevant parameters, such as absolute temperature differ- ences, temperature-dependent properties, and high amplitudes were not covered exhaustively. However, the very versatile procedure can be very useful for further investigations in this regard. v Teile der vorliegenden Dissertationsschrift wurden vom Autor bereits vorab auf Konferenzen vorgetragen und als Konferenz- und Zeitschriftenbeiträge veröffent- licht (Strobio Chen et al, 2015; Witte et al, 2016 a,b; Witte and Polifke, 2015, 2016, 2017 a,b, 2019).

Fire, which is the conversion of some type of fuel to chemical products, light, and heat by oxidation, was harnessed even in prehistoric times. Later, more sources of primary energy—natural sources of energy—were used and converted into mechan- ical energy, e.g. in windmills, water wheels for gristmills, and trip hammers. The industrial revolution, starting in the second half of the 18 th century, was made pos- sible by the increasing use of steam power with coal as the primary energy source. From an engineering perspective, the conversion of energy from one form to an- other is one of the main tasks. Energy is needed for electricity, heat, transporta- tion, and the manufacturing of goods. In 2014, the supplied primary energy for the whole world was 13 699 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) which amounts to 159319 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016). Oil, coal, and natural gas, all of which are fossil fuels, made up more than 80 % of all fuel shares (International Energy Agency, 2016). A total of 108 043 TWh was consumed in 2014, 29.04 % of which by industry and 28.03 % by transportation. A share of 8.09 % of the consumed primary energy was put to non-energy use, e.g. chemical products (International Energy Agency, 2017). The total generation of electricity and heat in power stations was 23 816 TWh (International Energy Agency, 2016) and 3815 TWh, respectively (Inter- national Energy Agency, 2017). With losses of 32 203 TWh, this leads to an overall efficiency for the conversion of primary energy to electricity and heat of 46.02 %. The use of carbon (coal) or hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) as energy source bears—among others—two main problems: During the combustion process nitrous oxides (NO x) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are generated in considerable amounts. NOx is associated with negative consequences for the health of humans (WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2003) and is a precursor for other pollutants such as acid rain. CO 2 plays a major role in the greenhouse effect determining earth’ s sur- face temperature (Rodhe, 1990; Lacis et al, 2010). The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is caused to 60 % by the man-made emission of CO 2 (Rodhe, 1990). In the last 200 years, the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere rose from about 280 1 Introduction parts per million (ppm) to over 400 ppm (Houghton and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001). CO 2 is besides water one of the main products of the combustion process and can only be reduced by increasing efficiency. To counteract the negative effect of the energy sector on the environment, the United Nations Summit in Brasil 1992 published objectives for the “energy devel- opment, efficiency and consumption” in the “ Agenda 21” United Nations : The basic and ultimate objective of this programme area is to reduce adverse effects on the atmosphere from the energy sector by promot- ing policies or programmes, as appropriate, to increase the contribution of environmentally sound and cost-effective energy systems, particu- larly new and renewable ones, through less polluting and more efficient energy production, transmission, distribution and use. This objective should reflect the need for equity, adequate energy supplies and increas- ing energy consumption in developing countries, [. ], and the situations of countries highly vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change. This paragraph emphasizes the need for more efficient energy production and new energy systems. Both goals can only be achieved through research on existing ma- chinery and principles as well as on new approaches. 1.01.02 Transformation Between Thermal Energy and Acoustic Energy One energy conversion mechanism that has to be taken into consideration is the conversion from thermal energy to acoustic energy and vice versa. Research in this area offers possibilities to achieve both objectives from the United Nations Summit: higher efficiency of existing technology and new approaches to energy conversion. Although known for about two centuries, this conversion mechanism has been ne- glected and came into focus again rather recently. The term thermoacoustics was coined to describe this effect which was first reported by Higgins and Rijke. Higgins discovered that a hydrogen flame placed in a tube would emit sound. This setup is now known as the “singing flame”. Later a similar phenomenon was found by Rijke who was experimenting with a heated wire mesh inside a resonator tube. He also experienced a clear sound that was emitted from the open ends of the resonator. The device is now called the Rijke tube. Credit is also due to Rayleigh who was the first to put thermoacoustics on a firm theoretical foundation. He recognized that the dynamics of the heat transfer between flame or heated wire and the fluid in the tube is the essential ingredient. At the time of these discoveries, these pioneers could not possibly image which importance their research might have for energy systems today. 1.01 Motivation Thermoacoustic Instabilities in Energy Systems An example of a well-established energy system is the stationary industrial gas tur- bine. Modern gas turbines for electricity generation operate with lean and premixed combustion (Keller, 1995). Air is compressed to pressures as high as 30 times the environmental pressure (Jansohn, 2010). Subsequently, the air is mixed with natural gas in a plenum and oxidized at a high air–fuel ratio in the burner. The combustion products enter the turbine section at temperatures up to 1400 ◦C (Jansohn, 2010). The turbine converts the energy of the hot flue gas into mechanical energy driving the compressor and an electric generator to produce electrical energy. Gas turbines have a severe impact on the environment. A portion of 21.06 % of the total electricity was produced from natural gas (International Energy Agency, 2016) and mostly in gas turbines. In predictions for the year 2040, this share is expected to rise to 27.05 % (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016). The optimal op- erating point, especially the flame temperature, is determined by the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and NO x produced in the combustion process. Lean pre- mixed combustion is however prone to thermoacoustic instabilities (Keller, 1995; Paschereit and Polifke, 1998; Jansohn, 2010; Laera et al, 2014). If such an instability occurs, small fluctuations in pressure and fluid velocity are amplified greatly. This amplitude can be as high as 1 % of the mean operating pressure of the combustion (Paschereit and Polifke, 1998). This has a negative impact on efficiency and the life cycle of the gas turbine (Laera et al, 2014). In turn, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted by the power plant is directly related to its efficiency. Moreover, ther- moacoustic oscillations disallows certain working conditions, e.g. turndown, that would allow a more flexible energy generation. Increasing the efficiency and flex- ibility of gas turbines for power generation would have a positive effect on their environmental impact. Domestic boilers, used for heat production on a household level are also prone to thermoacoustic instabilities. Large pulsations can be harmful to the device and im- pede efficiency similar to the gas turbine. In domestic boilers, the heat exchanger, which holds the water to be heated by the flue gas from the combustion, also in- fluences the thermoacoustic stability of this system (Strobio Chen et al, 2015). The heat exchanger is a cold, coiled tube placed in the hot flue gas stream in a cross- flow configuration. The heat transfer between the gas and the heat exchanger tubes can dampen or drive pressure oscillations. Of particular importance to this effect is the time lag between heat transfer and pressure oscillation. This phase lag decides whether acoustic fluctuations are dampened or excited. 1 Introduction Harnessing the Thermoacoustic Effect In the above-mentioned examples of the gas turbine and the domestic boiler, the thermoacoustic effect, where thermal energy is converted into pressure fluctuations and acoustic velocity fluctuations, are harmful and thus unwanted. However, the thermoacoustic effect can be harnessed in devices such as a thermoacoustic engine or a thermoacoustic refrigerator. In the thermoacoustic engine, strong temperature gradients are created—most often through the use of heat exchangers—at a compo- nent called stack or regenerator. The working gas moves back and forth through the temperature gradient. It absorbs heat closer to the hot side, leading to an expansion of the gas and releases the heat to the stack at the cold end and thus the gas is com- pressed. Periodic compression and expansion of the working gas is acoustic energy, which can be converted to mechanical energy or electrical energy or be transmitted to a second thermoacoustic stage. This second stage also has a stack and two heat exchangers. At the second stack, a temperature gradient develops caused by the acoustic oscillation. The hot end is cooled against ambient conditions allowing the cold side to assume temperatures below ambient conditions. This is called a ther- moacoustic refrigerator. It does not necessarily have to be implemented as a second thermoacoustic stage but can also be driven, e.g. by a piston. These configurations are rather simple to build and very robust. The basic body is usually a rigid resonator tube with closed ends. However, as of today, devices harnessing the thermoacoustic effect suffer from low efficiency. 1.01.03 Heat Transfer Dynamics in Unsteady Flow The configurations mentioned in the previous sections in which thermoacoustics play a vital role can be divided into two groups. In the “singing flame” and the gas turbine, the combustion process is driving the instabilities. In contrast, in the Rijke tube, in domestic boilers, as well as in thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators the fluctuations are driven by the heat transfer between the fluid (working gas) and a solid body. This makes the heat transfer between a solid body in fluctuating flow worthwhile investigating. Moreover, configurations with solid–gas heat transfer, like the Rijke tube, are often used in the basic research of combustion instabilities. The Rijke tube, in particular, is the prototype of a thermoacoustic device (Rijke, 1859; Raun et al, 1993). It has gained interest for the study of the phenomenon of thermoacoustic oscillations in the last decades although there are little direct applications in industry. It is a cheap tool to study thermoacoustic phenomena as they occur, as a potentially harmful byproduct, in stationary gas turbines for power generation (Benoit and Nicoud, 2005). In the case of the Rijke tube, for example, the centerpiece is a heated wire, usually in the form of a loosely wound coil or mesh. A resonator tube, hence the name Rijke 1.02 Aims tube, sets the conditions for fluctuations to grow in strength. This makes the config- uration of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow the perfect specimen for basic research in this area. The single cylinder stands for the wire, and the acoustic wave inside the tube is represented by the pulsations. An additional practical example, where the effect of a bluff body in fluctuating cross- flow plays a vital role is hot-wire anemometry (Bruun, 1996). For this method for flow measurement, turbulence and its effect on the heat transfer are important. Here, the pulsations are due to fluctuations occurring in turbulent flow. Closely related to the transfer of heat between solid body and fluid is the transfer of momentum. It appears as the skin friction on the surface of the solid body. Although of lesser importance for cylindrical configurations, the effect of its dynamic behav- ior can be seen as the Basset history force in the case of a solid spherical particle Basset. It significantly influences the trajectory of a particle in unsteady flow or if the particle experiences acceleration. 1.01.04 Modeling and Modeling Techniques In the case of any complex phenomenon, there is a desire for modeling. A model, often in the form of mathematical formulas, is a vehicle to understand phenomena, to place them in a greater perspective and can ultimately serve as a design tool. Hence, this thesis is also motivated by the desire to find an adequate procedure to acquire a model for the dynamic behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow and to provide models for cases like the Rijke tube. This has never been done in such detail using data based modeling techniques. The models presented in this thesis refer to the heated wire in the Rijke tube mostly and can directly be used in research activities involving a Rijke tube. Additionally, the techniques refined and assessed in this thesis can be applied on similar configu- rations like domestic boilers and thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators. It is also of interest in research directly related to gas turbines. This thesis tries to make a step towards a sustainable and ecologically sensitive energy production by improving the models and modeling techniques in the area of thermoacoustics. 1.02 Aims This thesis had three main goals: The first objective was to give an exhaustive qual- itative and quantitative description of the linear dynamic behavior of heat trans- fer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow in different flow regimes (Reynolds numbers). In particular, Reynolds numbers Re ≤ 40 are of interest for 1 Introduction the Rijke tube and hot-wire anemometry. Implications for these pulsating flow con- figurations are drawn. The limitations of previous studies of this problem, e.g. by Lighthill, are scrutinized. Crucial assumptions are identified and compared to solutions from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This way, a much more com- prehensive understanding of the complex flow physics was achieved. The assessment of techniques for system identification (SI) in combination with CFD simulation for data generation in the scope of skin friction and heat transfer was the second aim. This procedure not only supplements the first goal but also provides a framework for further studies in this field using SI techniques. The final objective was to develop low-order models for skin friction and heat trans- fer. Transfer functions—as they often appear in control theory—are well founded in theory and provide a concise representation of the results. A parametrized low- order model for the heat transfer dynamics is of avail in the modeling of the Rijke tube for further studies on thermoacoustic oscillations. Particular attention was given to two phenomena: peak gain that occurs at low but non-zero frequencies and the phase difference at high frequencies. 1.03 Scope This thesis is based on techniques and methods introduced by Föller et al for the investigation of this problem, but represents a significant advancement over previous computational studies (Apelt and Ledwich, 1979; Kwon and Lee, 1985; Nicoli and Pelcé, 1989; Payne, 1958; Föller et al, 2008). The heat transfer of a heated cylinder in pulsating crossflow was analyzed through state-of-the-art CFD meth- ods focusing on flow at Reynolds numbers of Re = 0.04, Re = 4, Re = 40, Re = 120, Re = 240, and Re = 3900. Reynolds numbers below the vortex shedding threshold (Re ≤ 40) are examined in even more detail. The dynamics are quantified using SI techniques. This approach to combine CFD simulations for data generation and SI methods to acquire models for the transfer behavior is called CFD/SI method. It represents the foundation for this thesis. After introducing the phenomena of a cylinder in steady crossflow, governing equa- tions are given, and simplifications are discussed in Chapter 2. Methods and results from previous studies of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow reported in the scientific literature are presented in Chapter 3. Special consideration is given to the widely acknowledged work by Lighthill and succeeding analytical papers. Chapter 4 deals with linear dynamic systems that are used to describe the dynamic nature of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. The framework is introduced, and the methods employed in later chapters are shown in detail. The methods and settings of CFD techniques are presented in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, 1.03 Scope heat transfer and skin friction dynamics of a cylinder in crossflow are quantified using data from CFD/SI method. The results are tabulated as transfer functions and presented as step responses and frequency responses of the linear system. Differ- ent approaches to acquire the transfer function are assessed and finally compared. To improve the understanding of the underlying flow physics, Chapter 7 offers a detailed view of the flow field and the spatial distribution of skin friction and heat transfer. Low order models are presented in Chapter 8, designed to be valid for a broad range of Reynolds numbers including corrections for different conditions. Applications, namely the Rijke Tube, hot-wire anemometry, and heat exchangers, are outlined in Chapter 9. In Chapter 10, conclusions are drawn, and an outlook for further areas of research is provided. 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder A circular cylinder is one of the most basic shapes in geometry. Its surface is defined by all points in a fixed distance r from an (infinitely long) straight line, which is called axis. Fluid flow around a circular cylinder, perpendicular to its axis, and heat transfer between cylinder 1 and fluid is one of the archetypal problems of thermo- fluid dynamics (King, 1914; Collis and Williams, 1959; Tritton, 1959; Fornberg, 1980; Sparrow et al, 2004; Baehr and Stephan, 2011; Bergman et al, 2011; Hucho, 2011). It is a geometrically simple example for external flow, i.e. flow around a bluff body. The steady-state flow was assessed very thoroughly in the past (Zdravkovich, 1997) and is an important vantage point for further analyses. In this section, the case of a cylinder in steady crossflow is surveyed first. Subsequently, governing equations are given and the concept of small perturbations in free-stream flow velocity, i.e. pulsations, is introduced. 2.01 Cylinder in Steady Crossflow A cylinder, placed in a stream of fluid with constant and uniform velocity, disturbs the flow. The fluid can neither pass through the cylinder nor slip along its surface. At the most upstream point of the cylinder, the fluid is at rest, and the kinetic energy of the fluid is converted into enthalpy, i.e. pressure. This location is called theforward stagnation point. Along a streamline close to the surface of the cylinder, the favor- able pressure gradient forces the fluid to accelerate along the circumference of the cylinder. It reaches a velocity higher than the velocity of the approaching flow in a short distance to the surface of the cylinder. The pressure gradient reverses at the lee side of the cylinder, causing the flow to decelerate until reaching therear stagnation point. Velocity profiles at different positions along the cylinder circumference are sketched in Figure 2.01. Under the assumption that the flow of a Newtonian fluid 2 is isothermal and in- compressible, the velocity field around a cylinder is determined by four reference quantities: cylinder diameterd, free-stream velocityu∞, dynamic viscosityµref, and density ρref. This relationship can be written as u = f (d,u∞,µref,ρref). (2.01) 1 For reasons of readability, cylinder in this thesis always refers to a circular cylinder. 2 A fluid where the viscous forces are linearly dependent on the strain rate (White, 2007). 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder windward side lee side cylinder forward stagnation point rearward stagnation point Figure 2.01: Sketch of a Cylinder in Steady Crossflow.Velocity profiles are shown as blue arrows. Grey lines signify the thickness of the boundary layer and the zone of flow separation. The basic dimensions involved are mass, length, and time. Following a dimensional analysis, there is one parameter group describing the relationship between these quantities. This dimensionless quantity is known as Reynolds number and is defined as Re = u∞ d ν (2.02) with the kinematic viscosity νref = µrefρref. The Reynolds number can also be in- terpreted as the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces, i.e. the ratio of convective momentum transport to diffusive momentum transport (Bergman et al, 2011). Different velocity profiles lead to characteristic patterns, or regimes, of the flow especially downstream of the cylinder, where the adverse pressure gradient is governing the flow. Theses patterns are characterized by the Reynolds number (Zdravkovich, 1997), as explained in a short survey of the physical phenomena in the following section. 2.01.01 Phenomenology Several authors gave comprehensive lists of flow regimes of cylinders in crossflow (Gersten, 1965; Zdravkovich, 1997; Hucho, 2011). The regimes identified by Hucho are reproduced in Table 2.01. 2.01 Cylinder in Steady Crossflow Reynolds number range Regime Re → 0 creeping flow Re < 50 closed wake 50 < Re < 140 −200 Kármán vortex street 200 < Re < 260 transition in far wake 260 < Re < 1 ×103 transition in near wake 1 ×103 < Re < 2 ×105 transition in shear layer 2 ×105 < Re < 4 ×105 critical 4 ×105 < Re < 1 ×106 post-critical 1 ×106 < Re trans-critical Table 2.01: Cylinder Flow Regimes (Hucho, 2011). Regime Re creeping flow 0.04 attached flow 4 closed vortex pair 40 Kármán vortex street 120 transition in wake 240 subcritical 3900 Table 2.02: Reynolds Numbers Examined in this Thesis. The range Re ≤ 40 is exam- ined in more detail. Recent numerical simulations by Rajani et al assessed the flow past a cylin- der in the laminar regime. Flow separation and the formation of a closed wake are reported to occur at Re > 6.01. For the wake instability, Rajani et al found the onset of vortex shedding to occur at 48 < Re < 49. This is close to the value of Re = 47 reported by Norberg. Rajani et al also found that the distortion of the spanwise vorticity (z-direction) occurs at Re> 250 and Re> 200 in streamwise direction (x-direction). The flow is two-dimensional for Re< 200. Similarly, Norberg reported this onset of three-dimensional structures to occur at Re > 190. In this thesis, one exemplary Reynolds number is chosen for every regime. Table 2.02 lists the flow regimes encountered at the flow conditions examined in this thesis. 2.01.02 Heat and Momentum Transfer To quantify the flow around a cylinder, a frame of reference has to be set. In this thesis, three different coordinate systems are used. The Cartesian coordinate system is the most important one. The x 1-direction is parallel to the undisturbed flow. The 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder x∗ y∗ x 1 x 2 φ r Figure 2.02: Coordinate Systems for the Cylinder. x 2-coordinate and the x 3-coordinate are normal to the first so that the x 3-direction is parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Hence, for flow with a negligible contribution in the axial direction, the coordinate system is reduced to [ x 1 x 2]T. The second frame of reference used is polar coordinates ([ r φ]T ). The origin is located in the center of the cylinder, but against the usual convention, the angle is chosen in such way that the forward stagnation point is located at φ = 0. The last coordinate system in- troduced in this thesis is denoted by [x∗ y∗]T. The x∗-direction follows the contour of the cylinder starting at the forward stagnation point. Accordingly,y∗ is the height above the surface of the cylinder. All three coordinate systems are depicted in Figure 2.02. If a cylinder (or any object for that matter) is submerged in a fluid and relative movement between cylinder and fluid occurs, momentum is transferred. This mo- mentum transfer, for a quasi-two-dimensional object like the cylinder, is quantified by drag and lift. Drag forces act in the direction of the flow. Lift forces occur nor- mal to the direction of the flow and the axis of the cylinder. The lift force is not considered further in this thesis, as the problem is symmetric and therefore the net contribution is zero. Fluctuations in the lift exist due to vortex shedding (Norberg, 2003), but are not the scope of this thesis, as they are not caused by forced pulsa- tions. Similar to the momentum transfer, heat transfer occurs when a temperature difference between the cylinder and the fluid exists. Directly at the surface of the cylinder, the flow velocity is zero (no-slip condition). At this position, momentum transfer occurs only throughskin friction and pressure differences. Skin friction is quantified through surface shear stress τw is given by τw = µ ∂u ∂y∗ ⃓⃓⃓⃓ y∗=0 (2.03) 2.01 Cylinder in Steady Crossflow d ∆T Nu Re Pr c f Figure 2.03: Sketch of a Cylinder in Steady Crossflow. assuming an isotropic and incompressible Newtonian fluid. The constant of propor- tionality is the dynamic viscosityµ. Similarly, theheat transfer rate at the surface q̇ w is given by Fourier’ s law for heat conduction written as q̇ w = −k ∂T ∂y∗ ⃓⃓⃓⃓ y∗=0 (2.04) with thermal conductivity k. Figure 2.03 shows a sketch of the problem with the relevant dimensionless parame- ters which will be developed below. Drag At the surface of the cylinder, the fluid is at rest. Heat and momentum transfer occur through viscous forces and pressure gradients. Conjointly, they amount to the drag force Fd acting on the bluff body. They solely depend on the fluid parameters u∞, ρref, and µref as well as the geometric quantity d. This drag force is denoted by Fd = f (d,u∞,ρref,µref). (2.05) Through dimensional analysis, this can be written as Fd 1/2 A ρref u 2∞ = f (Re) (2.06) where A is a reference area and 1/2ρu 2 ∞ is the dynamic pressure. The dimensionless group on the left hand side is called drag coefficient. It is given by cd = Fd 1/2 A ρref u 2∞. (2.07) The drag is a combination of form drag, also called pressure drag, caused by the cylindrical shape and the skin friction drag, caused by the friction on the surface. 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder hence, the drag coefficient is the linear combination of the pressure coefficient and the skin friction coefficient and hence reads cd = cp +c f (2.08) where cp represents the average pressure coefficient and c f is the average skin fric- tion coefficient. Friction Coefficients and Pressure Coefficients The pressure coefficient is evaluated from the relative pressure at each point on the surface of the cylinder. This is written as cp,φ(φ) = p(φ) −pref 1/2ρrefu 2∞. (2.09) Accordingly, the friction coefficient is calculated from the surface normal gradient of the flow parallel to the surface. This is denoted by c f,φ(φ) = ν 1/2 u 2∞ ∂uφ ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2. (2.010) The frictional part of the drag is also referred to as skin friction. Unlike the pressure, which adjusts instantaneously in an incompressible fluid, the skin friction has a convective nature, much like the heat transfer. Figure 2.04 shows the local pressure and friction coefficients for a cylinder in steady crossflow with Re = 0.04, Re = 4, and Re = 40. The average friction and pressure coefficients are given by c f = ν 1/2 u 2∞ 2π 2π∫︂ ∂uφ ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2 dφ = 2 Re d u∞ 2π 2π∫︂ ∂uφ ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2 dφ (2.011) and cp = 1 πρref u 2∞ 2π∫︂ (︁ p(φ) −pref )︁ dφ. (2.012) Figure 2.05 depicts pressure coefficient and friction coefficient as well as their combi- nation, the drag coefficient, over a range of Reynolds numbers. A simple empirical correlation for cd, valid for 1. Re. 2.05 ×105 was reported by White. It is given by cd = 1 + 10.00 Re(2/3).

It is determined by the heat conduction at the surface, the heat conduc- tion within the fluid, and the enthalpy transport by the flow. The involved thermo- dynamic reference quantities are heat transfer rate q̇, the temperature difference between the cylinder and the free-stream ∆T, isobaric specific heat capacity cp,ref, as well as thermal conductivity kref. These parameters are accompanied by three fluid dynamic quantities: velocity u∞, density ρref, and dynamic viscosity µref. The geometric quantity is the cylinder diameter d.The heat transfer rate can thus be inferred from q̇ = f (d,u∞,ρref,µref,cp,ref,kref,∆T ). (2.014) With the basic parameters—mass, length, time, and temperature—the heat transfer is determined by four dimensionless groups of reference quantities to describe the process q̇ kref/d ∆T = f (Re, Pr,Ec). (2.015) In addition to the Reynolds number, two other dimensionless groups appear. The Prandtl number Pr = νref α (2.016) with thermal diffusivityα = kref/(ρref cp,ref). It is the ratio of the diffusive momentum transport to the diffusive heat transfer. The group Ec = u 2 ∞ cp,ref ∆T (2.017) is called Eckert number and characterizes heat dissipation by the ratio of kinetic energy to flow enthalpy difference. Under the assumption of small velocities, the Eckert number vanishes Ec→ 0. Using Newton’ s law of coolingq̇ = h ∆T, the heat transfer reduces to h kref/d = f (Re, Pr,Ec). (2.018) With the Nußelt number given by Nu = h d kref, (2.019) this further simplifies to Nu = f (Re, Pr).

Re = 0.04 ( ), Re = 4 ( ), Re = 40 ( ), Re = 120 ( ), Re = 240 ( ), Re = 3900 ( ). Nußelt Number The temperature gradient at the cylinder can be non-dimensionalized using a char- acteristic length and a characteristic temperature difference. In this case, the char- acteristic length is the cylinder diameter d, and the characteristic temperature dif- ference is measured between undisturbed fluid and cylinder. The resulting dimen- sionless group is called Nußelt number and defined by Nuφ(φ) = d ∆T ∂T ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2. (2.021) In Figure 2.06, the Nußelt number distribution along the surface of the cylinder (0 ≤ φ ≤ π) is shown for three different Reynolds numbers. The average Nußelt number is given by Nu = d ∆T 2π 2π∫︂ ∂T ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2 dφ. (2.022) Similarity considerations show that identical Reynolds numbers and Prandtl num- bers yield similar temperature distributions and thus identical Nußelt numbers (Bergman et al, 2011). The average Nußelt number of a cylinder in steady crossflow can be evaluated using correlations of the form Nu = f (Re, Pr) (cf. Equation (2.020)). A number of correlations for the average Nußelt number exists with different do- mains of validity and accuracy (Bergman et al, 2011; Collis and Williams, 1959; Sparrow et al, 2004). Two correlations, for negligible temperature differences and 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder 10−2 10−1 100 101 102 103 10410−1 Re Nu Figure 2.07: Nußelt Number and Correlations.

The dots mark the values of Re = 0.04 ( ), Re = 4 ( ), Re = 40 ( ), Re = 120 ( ), Re = 240 ( ), and Re = 3900 ( ). a Prandtl number of Pr = 0.07, as well as point values for several Reynolds numbers under consideration are shown in Figure 2.07. Collis and Williams developed a correlation especially for air flow (Pr ≈ 0.07) and low Reynolds numbers (0.002 ≤ Re ≤ 44). It is given as a power law by Nu = (︁ 0.024 +0.056 Re 0.045)︁(︃Tm T∞ )︃0.017. (2.023) The Reynolds number is evaluated at the arithmetic mean temperature Tm between the temperature of the cylinder and the inbound fluid with T∞. A correction for the temperature dependence of the fluid parameters, e.g. viscosity, density, and thermal conductivity, is introduced with the term ( Tm/T∞)0.017. It can be rewritten as [1 +∆T /(2 T∞)]0.017 to incorporate the temperature difference between fluid and cylinder. For higher Reynolds numbers (1 ≤ Re ≤ 1.00 ×105), the correlation by Sparrow et al can be used. It is given by Nu = 0.025 + (︁ 0.04 Re 1/2 +0.006 Re 2/3)︁ Pr 0.037 (︃ µ µwall )︃1/4. (2.024) 2.01 Cylinder in Steady Crossflow In this case, fluid properties are evaluated at the free-stream temperature T∞. The correction term µ/µwall adjusts the Nußelt number to accommodate different cylin- der temperatures. 2.01.03 Flow Separation and Turbulence According to Rajani et al, an important regime change occurs at Re ≈ 6.01. In this case, and for any higher Reynolds number, the inertia of the fluid is not strong enough to overcome the adverse pressure gradient. Hence, the flow separates and detaches from the surface of the cylinder. In numerical simulations, the angle at the surface of the cylinder where separation occurs was evaluated. The smallest Reynolds number for which separation was de- tected in this case is Re ≈ 6.04. The angle φsep at which separation occurs at different Reynolds numbers is shown in Table 2.03. At higher Reynolds numbers, no steady recirculation zone exists, but vortices are shed periodically at both sides. The sepa- ration angle changes with time. Cycle averaged values are also given Table 2.03. Flow separation creates a wake that is no longer confined to a defined area, but the vor- tices are convected downstream. Turbulence develops downstream of the cylinder as a result of hydrodynamic instabilities within these flow structures. In laminar flows, small scale disturbances of the flow are immediately dampened out by the effect of viscosity dominating over inertia. However, flow with higher inertial forces and smaller viscous forces tends to accommodate slowly decaying chaotic three-dimensional flow structures. These are called turbulence. Enhanced mixing due to turbulence increases momentum and heat transfer (Davidson, 2004). Hence, effectively increased viscosity and thermal conductivity determine the fric- tion coefficient and the Nußelt number. The Reynolds number is often used as an indicator whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Low Reynolds numbers point towards laminar flow and large values characterize turbulent flow. This can also be seen in Table 2.01. Flow separation is a precursor to turbulence. A quantity subject to turbulence can be characterized by the mean value and the turbulent fluctuation. As an example, this is written for a component of the velocity vector as ui = ui +u′′ i.

The mean value is denoted by u and u′′ i is the fluctuation. 3 Turbulent structures carry energy in form of turbulent kinetic energy given by (Pope, 2000) E = 1 (︁ u′′ i u′′ i )︁. (2.026) Turbulence can be observed as flow structures. These structures can be seen as eddies of a certain wavenumber κ. This wavenumber may be interpreted as the reciprocal of a turnover time. Figure 2.08 depicts the relation between energy and wavenumber qualitatively. Turbulence gains kinetic energy at the largest scales (production process). This en- ergy is transferred to smaller scales, i.e. higher wavenumbers, and finally dissipated at the smallest scales (Kolmogorov scales). This process is called the energy cascade. Figure 2.08 distinguishes three regions in the lifecycle of an eddy passing through the energy cascade. Region I is the region of the largest eddies described by the integral time scale and length scale. In the context of a cylinder in crossflow, these scales are determined by the flow velocity and the diameter of the cylinder. The eddies, contributing to this region, carry the major part of the energy and most energy is produced. Region II is called the inertial range. Energy is neither produced nor dissipated but transferred to Region III. The energy spectrum in Region II is charac- terized by E(κ) =C ϵ2/3κ−5/3 (2.027) where C is a universal constant and ϵ is the dissipation rate. It is often referred to as Kolmogorov’ s−5/3 spectrum (Pope, 2000). The dissipation of the eddies occurs in Region III. This regime is characterized by the Kolmogorov length scale ( ∼ Re−3/4) and time scale ( ∼ Re−1/2) (Pope, 2000). Region II and Region III form the universal equilibrium range where the influence of the integral scales is weak. This range can be described by universal principles. 3 The notation with double prime signs ′′ was chosen to distinguish turbulent from “acoustic” fluctuations. 2.02 Governing Equations wavenumber energy I II III Figure 2.08: Energy of Turbulent Structures.Diagram adapted from Pope. Resolving these smallest scales is in many cases computationally very costly or even impossible considering today’ s computational capabilities. A practical and efficient way is therefore to model turbulence (Pope, 2000). 2.02 Governing Equations Fluid flow in the limit of small Knudsen numbers can be described by the con- tinuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics (Pope, 2000). In three spatial dimensions xi (x = [x 1 x 2 x 3]T ) and time t, the flow field is defined by a velocity vector ui with one component for every spatial direction, pressure p, and temper- ature T. Therefore, five balance equations for continuity, momentum for all three spatial directions, and energy have to be solved. Additionally, fluid properties are re- quired, which are generally dependent on temperature and pressure. Assuming an isotropic Newtonian fluid, stress tensors and strain rate have a linear dependence, and Fourier’ s law for heat conduction can be applied. In this case, the so-called transport properties are the first and the second coefficient of viscosity µ(T, p) and λ(T, p), respectively, and the thermal conductivity k(T, p). They are accompanied by the thermodynamic properties density ρ(T, p) and isobaric specific heat capac- ity cp (T, p). Moreover, body forces bi can act on the fluid. The most complete set of equations is the Navier–Stokes equations 4 which have been shown to represent experimental observations exceptionally well (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006). 4 The designation Navier–Stokes equations is used in this thesis for the full set of equations including continuity equation and energy equation. 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder 2.02.01 Navier–Stokes Equations The full compressible Navier–Stokes equations include the continuity equation, mo- mentum, and energy transport, and an equation of state. The following equations are given in index notation making use of the Einstein summation convention. Fur- thermore, δi j is the Kronecker delta δi j = 1 for i = j and δi j = 0 for i ̸= j. The Navier–Stokes equations (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006; White, 2007; Davidson, 2004; Landau et al, 1959) can be written by ∂ρ ∂t +u j ∂ (︁ ρu j )︁ ∂x j = 0 (2.028) ∂ (︁ ρui )︁ ∂t + ∂ (︁ ρui u j )︁ ∂x j = ρbi − ∂p ∂xi + ∂τi j ∂x j (2.029) τi j = µ (︃∂ui ∂x j + ∂u j ∂xi )︃ +δi j λ∂ul ∂xl (2.030) ∂ (︁ ρcp T )︁ ∂t + ∂ (︁ u j ρcp T )︁ ∂x j = βT (︃∂p ∂t +u j ∂p ∂x j )︃ + ∂ ∂x j (︃ k ∂T ∂x j )︃ +Φ (2.031) Φ = τi j ∂ui ∂x j (2.032) where τi j is the stress tensor and Φ denotes the dissipation function. 2.02.02 Fluid Properties Fluid properties can be classified in transport properties and thermodynamic prop- erties. In general, fluid properties depend on the thermodynamic state, i.e. on pres- sure and temperature. They can be interpolated from tabulated values or assessed with expressions. Most important is the notion of an ideal gas where the fluid prop- erties do not depend on its pressure but temperature, only. Transport Properties The first and second coefficient of viscosity, also called dynamic viscosity µ and bulk viscosity λ, are used to calculate the stress tensor τ (cf. Equation (2.030)). The 2.02 Governing Equations dynamic viscosity can be evaluated using Sutherland’ s law for the temperature de- pendency. It can be written as µ = AS ⎷ T 1 +TS /T (2.033) with the constants AS and TS depending on the fluid (White, 2007). For air, these constants are AS = 1.0458 ×10−6 kg/(ms K 1/2) and TS = 110.04 K. Sutherland’ s law is often given with three constants T 0, µ0, and S. In this case, the coefficients for Equa- tion (2.033) are TS = S and AS = (T 0 +S)µ0/T 3/2 0. Both viscosities are related by Stokes’ hypothesis. The thermal conductivity of a polyatomic gas can be evaluated using the modified Eucken formula (Poling et al, 2001). The formula was deduced from elementary arguments on the degrees of freedom of a gas molecule. It is given by k = µ(cp −R) (︄ 1.032 + 1.077 cp /︁ R −1 )︄ (2.034) where R denotes the specific gas constant. This constant is R = 287.0058 J/(kg K) for air. Thermodynamic Properties Fluid flows without chemical reactions or sudden changes, e.g. shock waves, exhibit only minor deviations from the thermodynamic equilibrium. It is, therefore, com- mon to assume that ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics are applicable (White, 2007). The most important thermodynamic properties are pressure, temperature, density, enthalpy, entropy, and internal energy. Considering the known equations of state, only two properties are independent. The most common choice is to use p and T (White, 2007). These are the variables solved for in the transport equations given above (Equation (2.028)–(2.032)). From these primary thermodynamic variables, secondary thermodynamic proper- ties can be derived. These are the isobaric specific heat capacity given by cp = ∂h ∂T ⃓⃓⃓⃓ p, (2.035) where h denotes the enthalpy, and the isochoric specific heat capacity written as cv = ∂u ∂T ⃓⃓⃓⃓ v. (2.036) The internal energy is denoted by u. The ratio of the specific heats is γ = cp cv. (2.037) 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder This ratio is close to 1.00 for nearly incompressible fluids and usually does not exceed 1.07 for any fluid (White, 2007). A quantity of similar importance, especially in gases, is the speed of sound, defined as a 2 = ∂p ∂ρ ⃓⃓⃓⃓ s = γ (︃∂p ∂ρ )︃ T. (2.038) The thermal expansion coefficient is given by β = −1 ρ (︃∂ρ ∂T )︃ p. (2.039) If pressure changes are small, the thermodynamic properties depend on temper- ature only. For specific isobaric heat capacity, enthalpy, and entropy, polynomial expressions in temperature have been developed (Chase, 1998). The respective quantity is evaluated using cp (T ) = R (︁ a 1 +a 2 T +a 3 T 2 +a 4 T 3 +a 5 T 4)︁, (2.040) h(T ) = R (︁ a 1 T +(a 2 T 2)/2 +(a 3 T 3)/3 +(a 4 T 4)/4 +(a 5 T 5)/5 +a 6 )︁, (2.041) s(T ) = R (︁ a 1 l n T +a 2 T +(a 3 T 2)/2 +(a 4 T 3)/3 +(a 5 T 4)/4 +a 7 )︁, (2.042) where a 1,a 7 are tabulated coefficients for a large number of fluids (Chase, 1998). Ideal Gas Law The ideal gas law is the equation of state for an ideal gas derived from kinetic theory. For many cases, e.g. air at ambient conditions, the ideal gas law is a good approxi- mation (Stephan et al, 2013; White, 2007). With the pressure and the temperature known from the transport equations, density is evaluated by ρ = p R T. (2.043) Inserting Equation (2.043) in Equation (2.038), the speed of sound for an ideal gas is given by a = √︁ γR T. (2.044) For ideal gases, the specific enthalpy includes the internal energy and the pressure– volume work h = u +R T. Therefore, the isobaric specific heat capacity can be eval- uated by cp = cv +R = γ γ−1 R. (2.045) 2.02 Governing Equations Isobaric Perfect Gas Under the assumption that the spatial and the temporal pressure changes are small, the formulation for an isobaric perfect gas expressed as ρ = pref RT (2.046) can be used. R and pref are constants and hence the density only depends on the temperature. This approximation has several consequences: Compression and expansion can only occur through changes in temperature. Small changes in local pressure and density are not coupled, and thus there is no wave propagation, and the speed of sound approaches infinity a → ∞. Moreover, an isobaric temperature change will not result in a change in volume or density and thus cp = cv = c. This also implies γ = 1. If a gas is considered incompressible, i.e. in the limit of low Mach numbers, still the isobaric specific heat capacity has to be considered c = cp (White, 2007). 2.02.03 Dimensional Analysis To identify relevant parameters and acquire independence from actual physical di- mensions, a dimensional analysis was carried out. Buckingham’sΠ-Theorem The idea of finding the relationship between physical quantities from their char- acteristic dimensions and units was formalized by Buckingham. The Π- theorem makes it possible to derive an equation that only contains products of variables and single non-dimensional products (Zierep, 1991). In the case of the Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.028)–(2.032)), 11 reference quantities are involved: velocity uref, density ρref, cylinder diameter d, gravitational acceleration g, ambient pressure pref, primary viscosity µref, secondary viscosity λref, specific heat capacity cp,ref, temperature Tref, coefficient of thermal expansion βref, and thermal conductivity kref. These reference quantities are accompanied by four base units for length (m), time (s), mass (kg), and temperature (K). The dimen- sion matrix, representing the powers of each base units occurring in the reference quantities is given in Table 2.04. The matrix is of full rank and thus Buckingham’ s Π-theorem yields 11 −4 = 7 dimensionless groups. 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder uref ρref d g p ref µref λref cp,ref Tref βref kref mass 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 length 1 −3 1 1 −1 −1 −1 2 0 0 1 time −1 0 0 −2 −2 −1 −1 −2 0 0 −3 temperature 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −1 1 −1 −1 Table 2.04: Dimension Matrix. Dimensional matrix for the reference quantities in the Navier–Stokes equations. Dimensionless Quantities With the reference quantities (cf. Table 2.04), the following dimensionless quantities are formed: xi = d x˜i t = d uref t˜ ui = uref u˜ i p = p˜ ρref u 2 ref +pref Φ = µref u 2 ref d 2 Φ˜ τi j = µref uref d τ˜i j ρ = ρref ρ˜ T = Tref T˜ β = βref β˜ bi = g b˜i cp = cp,ref cp˜ k = kref k˜ µ = µref µ˜ λ = λref λ˜ (2.047) If the ideal gas law is used to replace ρref in the expression for the pressure, an alter- native non-dimensionalization arises. Using the definition of the speed of sound, it is written as p = p˜ γ pref a 2 u 2 ref +pref. (2.048) Dimensionless Numbers Buckingham’ sΠ-theorem yields seven dimensionless groups. These numbers can be chosen arbitrarily. A common choice is to use Reynolds number: Re = uref d νref (2.049 a) Froude number: Fr = u 2 ref g d (2.049 b) 2.02 Governing Equations Prandtl number: Pr = µref cp,ref kref (2.049 c) Eckert number: Ec = u 2 ref cp,ref Tref (2.049 d) Isobaric expansion ratio: Kρ = −βref Tref (2.049 e) Euler number: Eu = pref ρref u 2 ref (2.049 f) Ratio of viscosities: Π = λ µ = −2 3 (2.049 g) Most of the dimensionless numbers are ubiquitous; e.g. the Reynolds number was already used in Section 2.01 to distinguish different flow regimes. The ratio of viscosi- ties is −2/3 according to Stokes’ hypothesis. The kinematic viscosity is derived from the dynamic viscosity by νref = µref/ρref. Other dimensionless numbers are linear combinations of the quantities given above. With the ideal gas law, the relationship between Euler number, Mach num- ber, and the ratio of specific heats is given by Eu = pref ρrefu 2 ref = a 2 ref γu 2 ref = 1 γMa 2 (2.050) with the Mach number Ma. The Mach number is another ubiquitous dimensionless group in gas dynamics given by Ma = uref a. (2.051) The alternative formulation for the pressure (Equation (2.048)) can be written as p = p˜ γpref Ma +pref. (2.052) 2.02.04 Non-Dimensionalized Navier–Stokes Equations Inserting all dimensionless quantities and groups in the Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.028)–(2.032)) yields the non-dimensionalized Navier–Stokes equations. They serve as a basis for further adaptations in this thesis. Hereinafter, the tilde ( ·˜) denoting a dimensionless quantity will be dropped. All quantities are understood 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder to be dimensionless, if not indicated otherwise. The dimensionless governing equa- tions are given by ∂ρ ∂t +u j ∂ (︁ ρu j )︁ ∂x j = 0 (2.053) ∂ (︁ ρui )︁ ∂t + ∂ (︁ ρui u j )︁ ∂x j = 1 Frρbi − ∂p ∂xi + 1 Re ∂ ∂x j [︃ µ (︃∂ui ∂x j + ∂u j ∂xi +δi j Π ∂ul ∂xl )︃]︃ (2.054) ∂ (︁ ρcp T )︁ ∂t + ∂ (︁ u j ρcp T )︁ ∂x j = Kρ EcβT (︃∂p ∂t +u j ∂p ∂x j )︃ + 1 Re Pr ∂ ∂x j (︃ k ∂T ∂x j )︃ + Ec ReΦ. (2.055) The ideal gas equation can be written as p Eu +1 = ρT. (2.056) Alternatively, using Equation (2.050), this equation of state can be reformulated to p γMa 2 +1 = ρT. (2.057) 2.02.05 Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations Some a priori assumptions lead to significant simplifications of the equation system. Justifications for these assumptions have to be given for the respective application. In Chapter 9, these simplifications are discussed for the Rijke tube (Section 9.01), hot wire anemometry (Section 9.02), and heat exchangers (Section 9.03). Assumptions The following three assumptions are made: (1) The flow velocity is much smaller than the speed of sound, i.e. Ma → 0. (2) The temperature exhibits only small devi- ations from the reference value, i.e. T → 1, and hence it does not influence the flow field. Nevertheless, heat transfer is still present. (3) No body forces act on the fluid. From these assumptions, several simplifications can be deduced. Simplifications The general equation of state for the density is expressed as ρ(p,T ). A Taylor series expansion around the reference state is given by ρ(T, p) = 1 + (︃∂ρ ∂T )︃ ref (T −1) + (︃∂ρ ∂p )︃ ref p +. (2.058) 2.02 Governing Equations The series is truncated after the first derivatives. This leads to a linearization around the reference state. Using the definitions of the coefficient of thermal expansion and the speed of sound yields ρ(T, p) = 1 +Kρ (T −1) +γMa 2 p. (2.059) Applying the first assumption Ma → 0 and neglecting terms of order O(2) or higher in Mach number Ma reveals ρ(T ) = 1 +Kρ(T −1). (2.060) Hence, variations in the density depend only on temperature and not on the pres- sure. For an ideal gas (Kρ = 1), this simplifies even further to ρ = T. Furthermore, the Eckert number can be rewritten as Ec = Ma 2 a 2 ref cp,ref Tref. (2.061) If an ideal gas is assumed, the factora 2 ref/(cp,ref Tref) = γ−1 is of order unity and thus Ec is of order O(Ma 2). Therefore, also terms proportional to the Eckert number can be neglected when the Mach number is low. From Equation (2.060) follows that if T → 1 also ρ → 1. In other words, if temperature differences are small, only small differences in density occur. The consequence is that density becomes constant and ρ → 1. Moreover, the fluid properties, viscosity µ, thermal conductivity k, and specific heat capacity cp are also unity. Body forces usually arise from buoyancy or an acceleration of the reference system. Buoyancy requires a density gradients which are eliminated because of ρ → 1. It is furthermore assumed that the reference system is at rest and hence the terms proportional to bi vanish. Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations The assumptions made above, in short Ma → 0, T → Tref, and bi → 0 yield the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The energy equation is reduced to a scalar transport equation. Only a one-way coupling from the ve- locity field to the temperature exists but not vice versa. Temperature only occurs in derivatives, and hence a different non-dimensionalization is more elegant. Heat transfer between a surface with temperature Tw and a fluid with temperature T∞ is commonly described using a dimensionless temperature defined by Θ ≡ T −T∞ Tw −T∞. (2.062) 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder Inserting this in Equations (2.053) to (2.055) yields ∂u j ∂x j = 0 (2.063) ∂ui ∂t +u j ∂ui ∂x j = −1 ρ ∂p ∂xi + 1 Re ∂2 ui ∂x j ∂x j (2.064) ∂Θ ∂t +u j ∂Θ ∂x j = 1 Re Pr ∂2Θ ∂x j ∂x j. (2.065) These are the basic equations for the CFD simulations carried out in this thesis, except for a brief survey on the influence of the cylinder temperature Tw. In this case, the compressible Navier–Stokes equations were solved. 2.02.06 Vorticity Stream Function Formulation Equations (2.063) to (2.065) show the Navier–Stokes equations in primitive variables. In incompressible two-dimensional flow ( x = [x 1 x 2]T ), the use of the quantities stream functionψ and vorticity ζ, which are derived from velocity, is often beneficial (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006, p. 42). Vorticity is defined as the curl of the flow velocity vector. In two-dimensional cases only, the component associated with the x 3-direction is nonzero and given by ζ = ∂u 2 ∂x 1 − ∂u 1 ∂x 2. (2.066) The stream function quantifies the volumetric flow rate through a line connecting any two points in the flow field. A line of constant stream function is considered a streamline. The velocity components are evaluated from the partial derivatives of the scalar stream function by u 1 = ∂ψ ∂x 2 and u 2 = −∂ψ ∂x 1. (2.067) Using vorticity and stream function, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.063)–(2.065)) reduce to ∂2ψ ∂x 2 + ∂2ψ ∂x 2 = −ζ (2.068) ∂ζ ∂t +u j ∂ζ ∂x j = 1 Re ∂2ζ ∂x j ∂x j (2.069) ∂Θ ∂t +u j ∂Θ ∂x j = 1 Re Pr ∂2Θ ∂x j ∂x j. (2.070) 2.02 Governing Equations The transport equation for the temperature is the same as Equation (2.065). In this formulation, the Nußelt number is defined as in Equation (2.021). The skin friction coefficient can be given by c f = 2 Reζw (2.071) using the vorticity at the surface of the cylinder. The main advantage of this approach is that the pressure does not appear in equa- tions (2.068) to (2.070) and thus need not be calculated. Moreover, the equations for vorticity and temperature both have the structure of an advection–diffusion equa- tion without sources or sinks. This form of the Navier–Stokes equations was used by many researchers in the past for investigations of flow across a cylinder, e.g. by Thom, Apelt and Ledwich, Fornberg, and Kwon and Lee. 2.02.07 Potential Flow Potential flow represents further simplification of the Navier–Stokes equations. In addition to the incompressibility ( ρ = 1), potential flow is inviscid, i.e. µ = 0, and irrotational, i.e. ζ = 0. The flow (without temperature) is hence fully described by applying the simplifications to Equation (2.068). This yields ∂2ψ ∂x 2 + ∂2ψ ∂x 2 = 0 (2.072) which is a Laplace equation for which analytical solutions exist in simple cases. It is named after the velocity potential ϕ, which is defined in such a way that the velocity is equal to the gradient of ϕ. Hence, ∂2ϕ ∂x 2 = ∂2ψ ∂x 2,∂2ϕ ∂x 2 = −∂2ψ ∂x 2, (2.073) and ∂2ϕ ∂x 2 + ∂2ϕ ∂x 2 = 0. (2.074) Lines of equal velocity potential and stream lines are always orthogonal. The so- lution of the potential flow also solves the Navier–Stokes equations except for the no-slip condition at the surface of the cylinder. Pressure is evaluated by integrating ∂p ∂x 1 = −∂ψ ∂x 2 ∂2ψ ∂x 1 ∂x 2 − ∂ψ ∂x 1 ∂2ψ ∂x 2. (2.075) 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder Analogously, the pressure gradient in x 2-direction can be integrated (Fornberg, 1980). Flow around a cylinder is represented by the superposition of a dipole (source and sink of equal strength) and parallel flow. If the dipole is located in the origin and par- allel flow occurs inx 1-direction, velocity potential, and stream function are given by ϕ = x 1 (︄ 1 + 1 (︁ x 2 1 +x 2 )︁ )︄ and ψ = x 2 (︄ 1 − 1 (︁ x 2 1 +x 2 )︁ )︄. (2.076) Transforming to polar coordinates (r,φ), the velocities in radial and circumferential direction read ur = (︃ 1 − 1 4 r 2 )︃ cosφ and uφ = (︃ 1 + 1 4 r 2 )︃ sinφ (2.077) respectively. 2.03 Transfer Analogies The temperature in Equation (2.065) and also in Equation (2.070) is an advection– diffusion equation (Davidson, 2004). The temperature, in this case, is a passive scalar, i.e. it does not affect the flow field. If the boundary conditions may be for- mulated in a corresponding manner, temperature can be replaced by any scalar quantity to be assessed. The only adjustment necessary refers to the dimensionless group quantifying the ratio between convective and diffusive transport, e.g. Re Pr in the case of temperature. A widely used analogy is the one between heat transfer and mass transfer. As can be seen by inspecting Equation (2.069), also the transport of vorticity follows this principle. 2.03.01 Analogy of Heat and Mass Transfer Mass transfer by diffusion from the surface of the cylinder is denoted by the specific flux of species ṅ A ([ṅ ] = mol/m 2 s). It is described by Fick’ s law given by ṅ A = −D AB ∂c A ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2 = hm(c A −c A,∞). (2.078) The coefficient of diffusion D AB quantifies the diffusive transport in the binary mix- ture of components A and B. c A is the molar concentration of component A and hm is the convective mass transfer film coefficient. This is analogous to Fourier’ s law (cf. Equation (2.04)) and Newton’ s law of cooling. 2.03 Transfer Analogies The energy equation in the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (2.065) has the structure of an advection–diffusion equation (Davidson, 2004) for the temperature. The temperature can, therefore, be interchanged with the dimensionless concentra- tion c A. Transport properties have to be adapted accordingly, and new dimension- less parameters arise for mass transfer. The Sherwood number, defined as Shφ(φ) ≡ d c A −c A,∞ ∂c A ∂r ⃓⃓⃓⃓ r =d/2, (2.079) quantifies the surface normal gradient of the concentration. The averaged Sher- wood number is given by Sh ≡ hm d D AB. (2.080) Hence, it is the mass transfer counterpart of the Nußelt number. The Prandtl num- ber is replaced by the Schmidt number, defined as the ratio between the momentum diffusion and the species diffusion by Sc ≡ ν D AB. (2.081) If Schmidt number Sc and Prandtl number Pr are equal, i.e. the Lewis number is unity Le ≡ Sc/Pr = 1, the dimensionless temperature and concentration fields coin- cide. The useful result of this analogy is that any correlation or consideration of the physi- cal argument given for temperature also holds for concentration. This thesis focuses on heat transfer. However, the substitutions T → c A, Nu → Sh, and Pr → Sc are valid throughout. Investigations explicitly concerned with the mass transfer from a cylinder to pulsat- ing flow can be found in Ohmi and Usui; Sung et al; Zierenberg et al (2006, 2007) 2.03.02 Reynolds’ Analogy Similar to the argument given for the analogy of heat and mass transfer, an anal- ogy between heat and momentum transfer can be deducted (Bergman et al, 2011). Vorticity (cf. Equation (2.069)) is, like temperature and concentration, governed by an advection–diffusion equation. The boundary equations are different to some extent, but nevertheless, the analogy still applies with acceptable accuracy. For Pr = Sc = 1, the equalities c f Re 2 = Nu = Sh (2.082) 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder are found. Following this argument, Reynolds’ analogy can be formulated by c f Re 2 = Nu Pr = Sh Sc. (2.083) Strictly, this expression only yields good results, if Prandtl number and Schmidt number are close to unity and there is no pressure gradient. In the Chilton–Colburn analogy, this statement is further refined to c f Re 2 = Nu Pr 1/3 = Sh Sc 1/3. (2.084) This is valid for a larger range of Prandtl numbers Pr and Schmidt numbers Sc, but only for favorable pressure gradients. If valid, this analogy may also be applied to surface averaged values. 2.04 Cylinder in Unsteady Crossflow The scope of this thesis is to investigate a cylinder in unsteady crossflow. In this case, flow quantities depend on time. To cope with this additional complexity, methods to handle perturbations are established. The response to small forced perturbations in velocity is quantified with transfer functions. This concept is introduced and re- visited in Chapter 4 within the framework of linear dynamic systems. 2.04.01 Perturbation Approach and Small Amplitudes To study unsteady flow, i.e. pulsations in the free-stream, a perturbation approach is considered. Any arbitrary variable f consists of a time independent mean contri- bution and a fluctuation. This relationship is expressed by f (x, t) = f (x) + f ′(x, t) (2.085) where the bar (·) denotes the mean value f (x) = lim t∗→∞ t∗ t∗ ∫︂ f (x, t)dt. (2.086) A prime ( ·′) signifies the fluctuation. A fluctuation in the flow velocity results in fluctuations in skin friction and heat transfer. All variables are dimensionless. Thus, they can be linearized using the same variable ϵ denoting the relative amplitude of any flow variable. The flow variables are treated 2.04 Cylinder in Unsteady Crossflow d ∆T Nu+Nu′ Re +Re′ Pr c f +c′ f Figure 2.09: Sketch of a Cylinder in Pulsating Crossflow. by Fourier series expansion, i.e. as a sum of complex exponential functions. This is written as f (x, t) = f 0(x) +ϵℜ (︁ f 1(x) ei Srt )︁ +ϵ2 [︁ fs (x) +ℜ (︁ f 2(x) e 2 i Srt )︁]︁ +. (2.087) where f is an arbitrary variable, and ℜ(·) denotes the real part. In this case, f 0 and fs are real-valued and f 1 and f 2 are complex-valued. The Strouhal number Sr is a dimensionless frequency and is defined by Sr ≡ ωd uref. (2.088) The angular frequency is denoted byω. The quantity fs (x) (with indexs) signifies the streaming component. This is a nonlinear time independent contribution caused by the oscillations or pulsations. The amplitude ϵ is assumed to be small. Terms of higher order in ϵ, e.g. ϵ2, can thus be neglected to reasonable accuracy. An arbitrary variable f is written by f (x, t) = f 0(x) +ϵℜ (︁ f 1(x) ei Srt )︁. (2.089) Note that the streaming component mentioned above is a term of order O(ϵ2) and therefore neglected. This also implies that no net contribution, i.e. a positive or negative contribution, when averaged over one cycle, occurs. 2.04.02 Pulsations The aim of this thesis is to investigate pulsations in the far field velocity and the resulting responses in skin friction and heat transfer. Figure 2.09 depicts this rela- tionship. To investigate the transient response, pulsations in velocity are introduced and resulting fluctuations are assessed. In this thesis, the term fluctuations refers to quantities experiencing changes in time and space. The term pulsations is used for temporal variations only. The significance of this convention is that flow variables 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder are usually subject to fluctuations. On the other hand, lumped quantities like the mean Nußelt number Nu changes with time only and therefore is subject to pulsa- tions. In conjunction with unsteady flow, the term oscillating flow is often used, e.g. by Stokes. Oscillations can be seen akin to pulsations. The difference is that it implies the reversal of the flow direction during a cycle. Peak velocities are larger than the mean flow velocity; hence, the assumption of small amplitudes does not hold in this case. This also applies to oscillations without any mean flow present. Velocity Pulsations The velocity field is given by the vector u = [u 1 u 2 u 3]T. In the far field, the influence of the cylinder is negligible. For simplicity, the velocity in the far field is chosen to have only a single contribution in x-direction and is denoted by u∞ or simply u∞. This restriction to solely one coordinate direction is relaxed in Section 9.02 only, where the far field velocity has a fluctuating angle of attack. Hence, a pulsation is introduced in u∞ in the form of u∞(t) = u∞ +u′ ∞(t). (2.090) As Fourier series expansion this reads u∞(t) = u 0,∞ +ℜ (︁ u 1,∞(Sr)ei Srt )︁. (2.091) The pulsations occur around a steady velocity which is also used as the reference velocity u∞ = u 0,∞ = uref. The velocity pulsations are the driving force for any other fluctuation. It is conve- nient to chose the parameter ϵ = u 1,∞/u 0,∞. Hence, a small parameter ϵ is equiv- alent to assuming that the velocity pulsations are small compared to the mean velocity u 1,∞ ≪ u 0,∞. The Reynolds number for a cylinder is defined with the free-stream velocity (cf. Equation (2.02)). With pulsation imposed on u∞ also the Reynolds number exhibits pulsations of the form Re(t) = Re +Re′(t), (2.092) leading to a Fourier series expansion written by Re(t) = Re 0 +ℜ (︁ Re 1(Sr)ei Srt )︁. (2.093) The mean flow Reynolds number is defined by the steady-state velocity Re 0 = Re = u 0,∞ d νref. (2.094) 2.04 Cylinder in Unsteady Crossflow Pulsations in Friction Coefficient and Nußelt Number The friction coefficient and the Nußelt number are used to quantify skin friction and heat transfer. Pulsations are treated in the same manner as for the Reynolds number. This leads to c f (t) = c f +c′ f (t) and Nu( t) = Nu+Nu′(t). (2.095) A Fourier series expansion yields c f (t) = c f,0 +ℜ (︁ c f,1(Sr)ei Srt )︁ and Nu( t) = Nu 0 +ℜ (︁ Nu 1(Sr)ei Srt )︁, (2.096) respectively. Pulsation Frequency The introduction of a (forced) pulsation frequency leads to another reference quan- tity that has to be incorporated in the dimensional analysis. The number of basic dimensions stays the same and hence one additional dimensionless group, quan- tifying the frequency, occurs. The Strouhal number as defined in Equation (2.097) is used in this thesis. With the given definition of the reference velocity, it can be written as Sr ≡ ωd u 0,∞. (2.097) The Strouhal number is therefore the number of cycles divided by 2 π that occur during the time it takes the fluid to cover a distance ofd. For example Sr= 2π ≈ 6.028 means exactly one cycle of sinusoidal fluctuation takes place while at the same time the fluid advances a distance equal to the diameter of the cylinder. Two other dimensionless groups are commonly used. As determined by the dimen- sional analysis, both can be given as products of the established set of dimension- less numbers. The Helmholtz number is given by He ≡ ωd a = Sr Ma (2.098) and will be revisited in Chapter 9. It is a crucial measure on the applicability of the incompressibility assumption. In confined flows, often the Womersley number defined by Wo ≡ √︄ ωd 2 ν = ⎷ Sr Re (2.099) is used. It describes in the thickness of the unsteady boundary layer as detailed in Section 3.01.02. 2 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder 2.04.03 Transfer Function and Frequency Response The relations between the pulsations of different flow quantities,i.e. between flow velocity, heat transfer, and skin friction is quantified using transfer functions. Reynolds number, Nußelt number, and friction coefficient are used to quantify this dynamic behavior. Transfer functions from Reynolds number pulsations to pulsa- tions in Nußelt number and friction coefficient are given by GNu = Nu′ /︂ Nu Re′ /︂ Re and Gc f = c′ f /︂ c f Re′ /︂ Re, (2.0100) respectively. The angular frequency is real-valued and hence is the Strouhal number. Due to this, the quantities Re 1, Nu 1, and c f,1 are also real-valued. Using this and Equation (2.089), the transfer behavior can be represented as the frequency responses denoted by GNu(Sr) = Nu 1(Sr) /︁ Nu 0 Re 1(Sr) /︁ Re 0 and Gc f (Sr) = c f,1(Sr) /︁ c f,0 Re 1(Sr) /︁ Re 0, (2.0101) respectively. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review This chapter offers an overview of the literature associated with objects, in partic- ular cylinders, in (continuously) pulsating flow. At first, the essential basic obser- vations of the thermoacoustic effect are presented in Section 3.01, including early mathematical models. The development of the boundary layer equations offered a means to acquire solutions for viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers and for basic geometries. Section 3.02 shows the application of the boundary layer equations to perturbed flow. The works by Lighthill and Gersten are examined in detail as they offer the best insight into the phenomenon. Apart from the boundary layer equations, which provide a good approximation for high Reynolds number flows, another simplified solution for low Reynolds numbers was used successfully in the past. Based on the Oseen equations, Bayly developed a mathemati- cal model for pulsating flow at low Reynolds numbers. This model is presented in Section 3.03. With the increased use of computers and CFD methods, better ap- proximate solutions for the full Navier–Stokes equations could be obtained within reasonable time. The approach by Kwon and Lee is presented, who solve a linearized version of the Navier–Stokes equations in the frequency domain. The development of methods for time series analysis gave rise to a multitude of other ap- proaches in which CFD simulation is combined with the adequate post-processing. The CFD/SI method, as used in this thesis, was applied by Föller et al. Studies involving the Navier–Stokes equations are presented in Section 3.04. Selected works related to the subject of pulsating flow including nonlinear effects and heat transfer enhancement is summarized in section 3.05. 3.01 Early Works on Unsteady Flows and Thermoacoustics The first reports on thermoacoustic oscillations date back over 200 years. Subse- quently, the “curio” was assessed systematically and lead to the principles and first mathematical models. They founded the basis for further investigations on heat transfer and skin friction in pulsating flows. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review 3.01.01 Thermoacoustics The first experiments on pulsating flows in conjunction with heat release from com- bustion were carried out in the late 18 th century by Higgins. A hydrogen flame was observed to produce audible sound if confined in a suitable glass tube. The “singing flame” was seen as an amusement, but should prove to be a signifi- cant discovery concerning combustion instabilities occurring in rocket engines and modern gas turbines (Keller, 1995). In pulsating or oscillating flow, heat transfer can damp, but also drive instabilities. The first observations of this thermoacoustic effect caused by heat transfer were reported by Sondhauß and Rijke. Sondhauß described an effect experienced by glass blowers. In a heated glass bulb with a long neck, thermal en- ergy is transformed into acoustic energy, which can be perceived as audible sound. This effect can be intensified by the use of a stack, a porous medium inside the neck, which extends the surface area (Swift, 2002, 2007). The important mecha- nisms for this self-sustaining oscillations take place in the boundary layer, which establishes in an oscillating flow at the solid surface. Kirchhoff described the influence of heat transfer on acoustic fields mathematically, and Rayleigh gave a widely accepted explanation for the thermoacoustic effect. A complete math- ematical model of the Sondhauß tube was given by Kramers and eventually improved significantly by Rott. The setup examined by Rijke is similar to the Sondhauß tube. It also has a glass tube as the main corpus. As in the case of the Sondhauß tube, the tube in Rijke’ s case serves as a resonator in which a standing wave exists. However, in this case, it is open at both ends. A heated wire mesh, placed in the lower half of the vertical tube induces a buoyancy driven mean flow. The heat transfer at the mesh responds dynamically to fluctuations in mean flow velocity so that the heat transfer and the standing wave pressure interact constructively. 3.01.02 High Frequency Oscillations over a Flat Plate One of the basic problems in unsteady flows is a fixed wall subject to an oscillating fluid. This is known as Stokes’ second problem (Stokes, 1851). Later, it was also con- sidered by Rayleigh.1 The velocity parallel to the plate can be described using the Navier–Stokes equations. In the limit of high frequencies, only the acceleration term and the viscous terms remain, and thus Equation (2.064) can be simplified to ∂ux∗ ∂t = 1 Re ∂2 ux∗ ∂y∗2. (3.01) 1 In the original statement, the fluid is at rest and the plate is oscillating but both configurations are equivalent. 3.01 Early Works on Unsteady Flows and Thermoacoustics This is in accordance with the theory of differential equations with large parame- ters, which states that large terms and the highest derivatives have to be retained (Lighthill, 1954). Inserting the Fourier series expansion (Equation (2.089)) yields i Sr (︁ u 1 −u 1,∞ )︁ = 1 Re ∂2 u 1 −u 1,∞ ∂y∗2. (3.02) At the surface, the fluid is at rest, i.e.u 1(y∗ = 0) = 0, and approaches the undisturbed flow velocity u 1 → u 1,∞ in a great distance to the plate y∗ → ∞. This differential equation can be solved analytically. The solution is given by u 1 = u 1,∞ [︂ 1 −e− ⎷ i y∗/δSt ]︂. (3.03) The similarity variable y∗/δSt uses the dimensionless thickness of the unsteady boundary layer (Stokes layer) δSt = √︃ Re Sr (3.04) for non-dimensionalization. The index St is chosen to emphasize that this boundary layer thickness is associated with Stokes flow. By introducing an oscillating free- stream velocity u 1∞ = ϵu 0,∞ cos(Srt), the solution (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006; Lighthill, 1954) written as u 1 = ϵu 0,∞ [︂ cos(Srt) −ey∗/δSt cos(Srt − y∗/δSt) ]︂ (3.05) is achieved. Figure 3.01 shows profiles of the velocity calculated with Equation (3.05) in proximity to the plate. The shear stress at the surface of the plate is proportional to the velocity gradient at this location. Hence, the slope of the velocity is a measure for the skin friction. The shear stress at the surface is given by τw = ⎷ iu 1,∞ δSt. (3.06) Assuming oscillating flow as in Equation (3.05) yields τw = ⎷ 2ϵu 0,∞ δSt cos (︂ Srt + π )︂. (3.07) The fluid motion is driven by the pressure far away from the plate given by ∂p ∂x∗ = −i Sru 1,∞ ei Srt. (3.08) It always exhibits a phase advance of π/2 in the far field. However, the boundary layer responds quicker to the pressure change, and thus close to the surface the 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review −1.05 −1 −0.05 0 0.05 1 1.050 2πδSt δSt u 1/u 1,∞ y/δSt Figure 3.01: Velocity Profiles of Oscillating Flow Close to a Surface. Instantaneous values of velocity for one full period from 0 to 2 π in increments of π/4 ( ). Additionally, the root mean square (RMS) value of the velocity is depicted ( ). pressure leads the velocity by onlyπ/4. This causes the phenomenon that the shear stress, for sufficiently high frequencies, is π/4 ahead of the free-stream velocity which might seem to contradict causality. Another important aspect is the thickness of the unsteady (acoustic) boundary layer, i.e. Stokes layer thickness δSt. It scales inversely with the square root of the Reynolds number and the Strouhal number. Hence, the boundary layer is thin at high Reynolds numbers and high Strouhal numbers. A fact also observed in steady boundary layers. Moreover, higher frequencies result in smallerδSt. The shear stress is inversely proportional to the boundary layer thickness and therefore rises with rising Reynolds number Re and Strouhal number Sr. 3.01.03 Motion of a Sphere Basset derived a formula for the motion of a sphere in a viscous fluid. He also accounted for the acceleration and how the evolution of the flow field affects the 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations motion at the present time. This resulted in the so-called Basset force. For a spherical particle, the Basset forces is evaluated with FB = 6πrpµf t∫︂ −∞ K (t −τ) d (︁ uf −up )︁ dτ dτ. (3.09) The (convolution-) integral sums the contributions of past particle acceleration weighted with the time that has passed since the acceleration occurred. This weight- ing factor, or kernel K (t −τ), decays over time with t−1/2. It is given by Basset as K (t −τ) = 1√︂ πνf(t −τ)/r 2 p. (3.010) This kernel can be seen as the impulse response (cf. Section 4.01.03) of the skin friction at the particle surface to perturbations in the acceleration of the particle relative to the flow. The dynamics of skin friction of a sphere in (accelerated) flow is important for the motion of particles in acoustic fields or under the influence of body forces like gravity. The Basset force was revisited since 1888 by several authors, e.g. by Yang and Leal as well as Mei and Adrian. It is closely linked to the dynamics of skin friction assessed numerically in this thesis. However, a spherical geometry is not in the scope of this thesis and thus will not be considered further. 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations The first study on the matter of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow was published by Moore. Lighthill followed a similar approach and specifically tailored it for a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. This study is one of the most recognized in this field of research. Under the assumption that the dynamics of a cylinder in crossflow are mainly governed by the stagnation point flow at the front quarter, the boundary layer equations for this case (Hiemenz layer, HL) were solved approximately. This led to two solutions for skin friction and heat transfer; one for low frequencies and one for high frequencies, respectively. This study was thereafter extended to com- pressible flow by Gribben. Glauert examined transversal movement of a cylinder in crossflow with the methods provided by Lighthill. Following this approach, Gersten solved the same equations numerically, us- ing a series expansion in frequency. Similar results were achieved, but with more consistent values for intermediate frequencies. Especially, the description of the skin friction dynamics is more consistent. Solutions were developed for stagnation point flow and flow over a flat plate (Blasius layer, BL). A solution for compressible flow based on Gersten was again developed by Gribben. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review Ackerberg and Phillips investigated the flow over a flat plate using an asymp- totic analysis in combination with numerical integration. The skin friction results were very similar to the solutions developed in this thesis. E.g. a characteristic dip in the phase of the friction coefficient in the transition between the initial rise and the saturation at π/4 was found and is recovered using the CFD/SI method in this thesis. Telionis and Romaniuk solved the boundary layer equations numerically, but yet again for a different kind of flow. The boundary layer solution for Howarth flow, i.e. the flow close to a stagnation point with prior deceleration, was chosen. How- ever, like the HL, this is also a rough approximation for the flow around a cylinder. A yawed cylinder undergoing spanwise and chordwise oscillations was investigated by Sarma and El-Hadi; Sarma and Srivastava. The skin friction was assessed using the boundary layer equations (Sarma and El-Hadi, 1986). Using a compressible formulation the heat transfer for this configuration was investigated Sarma and Srivastava. 3.02.01 Boundary Layer Equations The so-called boundary layer equations can be deduced from the Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.063)–(2.065)). A thorough derivation was given, e.g. by Schlichting and Gersten. They make use of the fact that, if the viscosity is small, a surface with no-slip condition affects the flow field only in a small region close to the surface: the boundary layer. Two main assumptions are made to derive the equations: (1) The boundary layer thickness is proportional to the square root of the viscosity δ ∼ ⎷ν. (2) The boundary layer thickness is much smaller than the characteristic length of the body submerged in the fluid. For a streamlined body, the characteristic length is the length along which the flow occurs. In the case of a cylinder, this is usually the diameter, i.e.δ ≪ d. Combining both yields δ d ∼ 1⎷ Re (3.011) and hence the boundary layer thickness tends towards zeroδ → 0 for infinitely large Reynolds numbers Re → ∞. Quantities associated with the y-direction, i.e. y and v are proportional to δ. Therefore, when the limit Re → ∞is considered, the Navier– Stokes equations reduce to the boundary layer equations. The effect of viscosity due to the presence of the surface is captured by the boundary layer. Hence, the outer flow is governed by the Euler equations (White, 2007), which 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations neglect the viscous terms. The outer flow velocity is often denoted by a capital U. The momentum equation then reads ∂U ∂t +U ∂U ∂x∗ = −∂p ∂x∗. (3.012) The outer flow velocity U is a concept similar to the free-stream velocity u∞. The notation with the capital letter is kept here to emphasize the relation with the boundary layer equations. The pressure gradient acting in the boundary layer is the same as in the outer flow, so Equation (3.012) can be used to replace the unknown pressure gradient in the momentum equation. Moreover, the outer flow solution serves as boundary condition and hence the full two-dimensional problem is given by ∂u ∂x∗ + ∂v ∂y∗ = 0 (3.013) ∂u ∂t +u ∂u ∂x∗ +v ∂u ∂y∗ = ∂U ∂t +U ∂U ∂x∗ + 1 Re ∂2 u ∂y∗2 (3.014) ∂T ∂t +u ∂T ∂x∗ +v ∂T ∂y∗ = 1 Re Pr ∂2 T ∂y∗2 (3.015) with the boundary conditions y∗ = 0 : u = 0, v = 0, T = Tw (3.016) y∗ → ∞: u →U, T → T∞. (3.017) 3.02.02 Lighthill The equations used by Lighthill are given in Section 3.02.01 as a simplifica- tion of the Navier–Stokes equations invoking the boundary layer approximations. In a landmark paper, Lighthill studied the response of laminar skin friction and heat transfer to fluctuations in the stream velocity. He presented approximate solutions for near-wall velocity and temperature profiles for the case of small pul- sation amplitudes (linear regime) and evaluated the corresponding displacement thickness, skin friction, and heat flow rate, respectively. For the case of a cylinder in low Reynolds number crossflow, the heat transfer frequency response in terms of amplitude reduction and phase lag was determined. Lighthill states that his solution “applies only at Reynolds numbers for which the boundary layer approximation has some validity (say R > 10)” and “in the range of Reynolds number for which a laminar boundary layer exists” (Lighthill, 1954). Lighthill already suggested that the unsteady response of the heat transfer rate to the perturbation of free-stream velocity is determined by the adaptation time of the viscous and thermal boundary layers. For harmonic perturbation, this 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review time lag controls the phase of the heat transfer frequency response function. For low frequencies, the time lag of the heat transfer was estimated as one fifth of the ratio of cylinder diameter and free-stream velocity. Perturbation Approach Lighthill’ s approach was to introduce small oscillations about a steady mean in the form of (cf. Equation (2.091)) u(x∗, y∗, t) = u 0(x∗, y∗) +εu 1(x∗, y∗)eiωt (3.018) and terms collected according to different powers of ϵ. The zeroth order equations are then just equal to the boundary layer equations (Equation (3.013)–(3.014)). Evalu- ating the time derivative, the first order equations are given by ∂u 1 ∂x∗ + ∂v 1 ∂y∗ = 0 (3.019) i ωu 1 +u 0 ∂u 1 ∂x∗ +u 1 ∂u 0 ∂x∗ +v 0 ∂u 1 ∂y∗ +v 1 ∂u 0 ∂y∗ = i ωU 1 + d dx∗ (U 0 U 1) +ν∂2 u 1 ∂y∗2 (3.020) i ωT 1 +u 0 ∂T 1 ∂x∗ +u 1 ∂T 0 ∂x∗ +v 0 ∂T 1 ∂y∗ +v 1 ∂T 0 ∂y∗ = k ∂2 u 1 ∂y∗2 (3.021) with the boundary conditions y∗ = 0 : u 1 = 0, v 1 = 0, T 1 = 0 (3.022) y∗ → ∞: u 1 →U 1, T 1 → 0. (3.023) Lighthill considered two limiting cases for skin friction and heat transfer, respectively. In the case of high frequencies, the acceleration terms are large com- pared to other contributions, and hence, only those and the derivatives of the high- est order are kept. For the calculation at low frequencies, such a simplification cannot be invoked. To solve the boundary layer equations, an integral Kármán– Polhausen treatment (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006, Section 8.01) was used. The re- sults are therefore an approximation within the accuracy of the assumptions made, e.g. the velocity profile is modeled as a fourth order polynomial in y. Skin Friction The momentum equation for high frequencies reduces to iω(u 1 −U 1) = ν∂2 u 1 ∂y∗2. (3.024) 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations This is equivalent to Stokes’ second problem (cf. Equation (3.01)) and hence the solu- tion is u 1 =U 1 (︂ 1 −e−y ⎷ iω/ν )︂. (3.025) The shear stress at the surface of the cylinder is given by (Lighthill, 1954, Equation (14)) µ (︃∂u 0 ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 +ϵeiωt µU 0 √︄ iω ν. (3.026) Using the definition of the transfer function (Equation (2.0100)) and inserting equa- tion (3.026) yields Gc f,Lighthill = ϵeiωt µU 0 √︂ iω ν /︃ µ (︂ ∂u 0 ∂y∗ )︂ y∗=0 ϵu 1 ei ωt /︃ u 0. (3.027) For low frequencies, Lighthill arrives at the following equation (Lighthill, 1954, equa- tion 38) µ (︃∂u 0 ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 +ϵeiωt [︄ µ (︃∂us ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 +i ωµ (︃∂u 2 ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 ]︄ = τ0 +ϵeiωt [︃3 2τ0 +iω1 2ρU 0δ∗ ]︃ (3.028) where the fluctuating velocity is decomposed into a quasi-steady part and an accel- eration dependent part, respectively, written asu 1 = us +i ωu 2. From a comparison between Equation (3.026) and Equation (3.028), Lighthill deduces a “matching fre- quency” given by ω0 = 3τ0 ρU 0 δ∗ (3.029) where δ∗ 0 is the displacement thickness. At this frequency, both solutions approx- imately coincide in amplitude and phase as well as in their respective velocity profiles. Finally, Lighthill assessed the quantitative value of this frequency for two different types of boundary layers: the boundary layer near a stagnation point (HL) and the flat plate boundary layer (BL). The velocity profile of the inviscid flow (potential flow) near a stagnation point is given by U 0 = β∗ x and V 0 = −β∗ y. Considering the potential flow solution of a cylinder in crossflow (Equation (2.076)) at the stagnation point, the derivative of the impinging flow velocity with respect to the distance to the surface is evaluated as β∗V d = ∂V 0 ∂y∗ = −∂u 1 ∂x 1 = ∂2ψ ∂x 1 ∂x 2 = x 1 (︁ x 2 1 +3 x 2 )︁ (︁ x 2 1 +x 2 )︁3.

(3.031) The curvature of the cylinder causes a deviation from the pure stagnation point flow. However, this influence is minor and was accounted for by averaging the velocity, i.e. the constant factor β∗, over the first quadrant of the cylinder to yield βV d = β∗ π π/4∫︂ −π/4 cos(φ)dφ ≈ 3.06. (3.032) The matching frequency for the HL is reported to be ω0 = 5.06βu 0,∞/d. Hence, the Strouhal number, as used in this thesis, is Sr 0 ≈ 20. Amplitude and phase of the skin friction frequency response for the HL are depicted in Figure 3.02. For the BL, the matching Strouhal number depends on the distance from the start of the flat plate and is Sr 0,BL = 0.06 x∗/d. The skin friction frequency response is depicted in Figure 3.03 in terms of amplitude and phase. At low frequencies, i.e. small values of Strouhal number Sr, Lighthill reported an “anticipation time” for the skin friction of τ = 0.005 d/u 0,∞ for the HL and τ = 1.07 d/u 0,∞ for the BL. The anticipation times can be given as dimensionless time constants cτ = 0.005 and cτ = 1.07, respectively. The boundary layer reacts faster to the pressure gradient necessary to accelerate the flow than the free-stream.

Am- plitude (top) and phase (bottom). creates the impression of the skin friction anticipating a change in velocity, which can be seen as a phase lead in the frequency response given by Gc f = K ei Srcτ (3.033) where K is the steady-state gain. The low-frequency limits are reported as Sr → 0 : |Gc f,Lighthill| =1.05 ∠Gc f,Lighthill = 0. The steady-state gain according to Lighthill has a value of K = 1.05, due to the fact that c f ∼ u 3/2 0,∞. It is stated that the approximation for the phase is applicable for Sr < 20. At high frequencies, all models agree on a square root dependence of the frequency response on the Strouhal number. This is closely related to a shear wave solution (cf. Section 3.01.02), which also predicts the constant phase lead of 45°. The limits for high frequencies are reported as Sr → ∞: |Gc f,Lighthill| → ∞ ∠Gc f,Lighthill = π/4. Heat Transfer The treatment Lighthill applied to the temperature was similar to the proce- dure for the skin friction. Only the HL was considered as Lighthill argues that 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠ GNu Figure 3.04: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer (Lighthill, 1954).Amplitude (top) and phase (bottom). the major part of the heat transfer takes place at the front quadrant of the cylinder containing the stagnation point. The heat flux density is given by (Lighthill, 1954, equation 61) −k (︃∂T 0 ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 + i ωϵeiωt k [︄ d U 0 dx∗ (︃∂T 0 ∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 1 +Pr 1/2 −U 0 (︃ ∂2 T 0 ∂x∗∂y∗ )︃ y∗=0 1 +2 Pr 1/2 (1 +Pr 1/2)2 ]︄ Approximate solutions for high frequencies and low frequencies were calculated from this equation. For the latter, Lighthill again applied a Kármán–Polhausen treat- ment. Time lag and steady-state gain according to Lighthill’ s approximation for low frequencies are determined to τ = 0.02 d/u 0,∞ (cτ = 0.02) and K = 0.05, respectively. The steady-state gain is taken from a linearization of King’ s law (King, 1914). The low frequency and high-frequency approximations for the heat transfer fre- quency response can be written as GNu,Lighthill = 0.05 1 +0.02 i Sr and GNu,Lighthill = 2.00 i Sr. (3.034) These relations are shown in Figure 3.04 as amplitude and phase of the heat transfer frequency response. 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations Lighthill stated that the first expression in Equation (3.034) is only applicable if Sr < 20. However, the heat transfer shows the behavior of a low-pass filter and as the limits Sr → 0 : |GNu,Lighthill| =0.05 ∠GNu,Lighthill = 0 Sr → ∞: |GNu,Lighthill| =0 ∠GNu,Lighthill = −π/2 indicate, high frequencies have very low gain and a phase lag of 90°, which agrees well with the high frequency approximation. Experimental Verification Hill and Stenning revisited the solution for the skin friction of a flat plate in pulsating flow by Lighthill. They extended the treatment to boundary layers of Howarth type and conducted experiments in this regard. Lighthill’ s analysis for the BL agree well with measurements in the frequency range 0 < Srx/d < 0.06. For higher frequencies, an intermediate regime was identified and modeled. Conclusions As it was unavoidable to introduce severe approximations to solve the equations of motion, Lighthill himself cautioned that his results would only be solutions of lim- ited accuracy and range of validity and applicability. Mariappan and Moeck also found discrepancies between Lighthill’ s predictions and their experi- ments. They argued that the time lag should be larger thanτ = 0.02 d/u 0,∞. Lighthill’ s results were only validated for velocity amplitudes in the unsteady boundary layer, but never with respect to heat transfer (Hill and Stenning, 1960). Presumably, this is due to the difficulties of time resolved measurements of heat flow rates. Never- theless, Lighthill’ s estimate for the time lag has since been used in many studies of the thermoacoustic instability of the Rijke tube (Hantschk and Vortmeyer, 1999; Matveev and Culick, 2003; Subramanian et al, 2010). In particular, Subramanian et al carried out a comprehensive bifurcation analysis of thermoacoustic instability. 3.02.03 Lin Lin, in contrast to Lighthill, concerned himself not only with the fluctu- ation but with the net change of any flow quantity due to pulsations. Lin’ s approach is based on the method of averaging (Telionis, 1981). Perturbed quantities in the fashion of Equation (2.085) were introduced in the boundary layer equations and subsequently averaged. This procedure is similar to Reynolds averaging (Gersten, 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review 1965; White, 2007; Davidson, 2004) and hence it also yields Reynolds stress terms known from turbulence treatment. For closure, Lin considered the high frequency approximation given by ∂u′ ∂x∗ + ∂v′ ∂y∗ = 0 (3.035) ∂u′ ∂t = ∂u∞ ∂t +ν ∂2 u′ ∂y∗2. (3.036) With u∞(x∗, t) = u∞(x∗)cos(ωt), this is equivalent to Stokes’ second problem and hence the solution can be written as u′ = u 1,∞(x∗)cos(ωt) −e−y∗⎷ ω 2ν cos (︃ ωt − y∗ √︃ ω 2ν )︃ (3.037) v′ = − y∫︂ ∂u′ ∂x∗ dy. (3.038) This information made it possible to evaluate the nonlinear terms u′(∂u′)/(∂x) and v′(∂u′)/(∂y). The method of averaging and the model for the Reynolds stress does not require the pulsations to be small. According to Telionis this approach has not gained much attention since the 1950 s. 3.02.04 Gersten Gersten revisited Lighthill’ s analysis and adapted it to the Falkner–Skan equa- tions. This form of the boundary layer equations provides a unified framework for wedge flow including stagnation point flow and flat plate flow. Gersten intro- duced first and second order perturbations to capture fluctuations and second or- der streaming effects with a non-vanishing net contribution. In contrast to Lighthill, he used series expansions in the similarity variable and the frequency pa- rameter instead of an integral Kármán–Polhausen treatment. Falkner–Skan Equations The Falkner–Skan equations are for wedge flows where the velocity is of the form U 0 = βxm. In this case, the Navier–Stokes equations have self-similar solutions with the similarity variable η = y l ⎷ Re x = y √︄ β νx(m−1)/2. (3.039) 3.02 Perturbation Boundary Layer Equations This includes, as special cases, stagnation point flow and flat plate flow. In the case of the HL, the exponent ism = 1. Thus, Lighthill’ s estimation to acquireβ for a cylin- der (cf. Equation (3.032)) can be used. In the case of the BL, m = 0, i.e. the velocity is constant. To derive the Falkner–Skan equations the stream function as in Section 2.02.06 (Equa- tion (2.067)) is used. Furthermore, two functions of the similarity variable η were introduced: f (η) = ψ(x, y)⎷ νx U(x) (3.040) g (η) = T (x, y) −T∞ Tw −T∞. (3.041) The Falkner–Skan equations are ordinary differential equations of the form f ′′′ + m −1 2 f f ′′ +m (︁ 1 − f ′2)︁ = 0 (3.042) Prg ′′ + m −1 2 f g ′ = 0. (3.043) The boundary conditions for steady-state wedge flow are given by η = 0 : f = 0, f ′ = 0, g = 1 (3.044) η → ∞: f ′ = 1, g = 0. (3.045) Series Expansion Pulsations were superimposed on the free-stream, which is denoted as outer flow by Gersten. The velocity is hence described by U =U [1 +ϵ cos(ωt)]. (3.046) To non-dimensionalize the frequency, the frequency parameter X = ωx U (x) = ω βx 1−m (3.047) was used. The frequency parameter can be converted into a Strouhal number as defined in Equation (2.097). For the HL this yields ( m = 1) Sr = 3.06 X and ( m = 0) Sr = X ·d/x for the BL. For the two prominent cases, the HL and the BL, Gersten developed transfer func- tions as power series of Sr. Similar to Lighthill’ s approach, the solution comprises separate approximations for low and high frequencies. Furthermore, Gersten claims to have remedied a mistake by Lighthill leading to a wrong far field boundary condition for the temperature. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review Skin Friction The dynamic skin friction was reported by Gersten as τw ⎷ Re = f ′′(0) +ϵAτ(Sr) cos(Srt +λτ(Sr)). (3.048) The fluctuating part is given as series expansion of the frequency parameter. The coefficients of these series were tabulated. Aτ(Sr) and λτ(Sr) denote the amplitude and the phase shift of the pulsations.f ′′(0) is the steady-state shear stress and evalu- ated to 1.02326 and 0.03321 for HL and BL, respectively. The transfer function for skin friction pulsation caused by pulsations of the free-stream velocity can be acquired from Gc f = Aτ(Sr) f ′′(0) eiλτ. (3.049) The frequency response for the HL is shown in Figure 3.05. The anticipation time eval- uated by Gersten is aboutτ = 0.0043 d/u 0,∞ and his model shows a smooth transition from low to high frequencies. The applicability of the low-frequency approximation is limited to Sr. 10 in this case. The low-frequency limit is reported to be K = 1.05. Low and high-frequency limits are given by Sr → 0 : |Gc f,Gersten,HL| =1.05 ∠Gc f,Gersten,HL = 0 Sr → ∞: |Gc f,Gersten,HL| → ∞∠Gc f,Gersten,HL = π/4. (3.050) For the BL, the anticipation time isτ = 1.07 d/u 0,∞ (cτ = 1.07). The frequency response for low and high frequencies are depicted in Figure 3.06. Both approximate solutions match reasonably well at Sr x/d ≈ 0.08. The low and high frequency limits are the same as for the HL (Equation (3.050)). Heat Transfer In an analogous manner, the pulsating heat transfer was given by Gersten as Nu⎷ Re = g ′(0) +ϵAq (Sr) cos(Srt +λq (Sr)). (3.051) The coefficients for the series expansion of the temperature gradient at the surface were tabulated and Aq (Sr) and λq (Sr) denote amplitude and phase shift of the series, respectively. The steady-state valuesg ′(0) = 0.04959 and g ′(0) = 0.02927 for HL and BL, respectively, are used for scaling. With the definition of the transfer function and Equation (3.051) the transfer function can be evaluated as GNu = Aq (Sr) g ′(0) eiλq.

The dotted part of the graph are values from a spline interpolation connecting the approximative solutions for low frequencies and high frequencies. The limits for low and high frequencies are Sr → 0 : |GNu,Gersten,HL| =0.05 ∠GNu,Gersten,HL = 0 Sr → 0 : |GNu,Gersten,HL| =0 ∠GNu,Gersten,HL = −π/2 (3.053) The results are in good agreement with the solutions of Lighthill. The steady- state gain K = 0.05 as predicted by King and the time lag is cτ = 0.0188. The BL was not assessed with respect to heat transfer by Lighthill. In contrast, Gersten reports the respective series coefficients and the resulting frequency response is depicted in Figure 3.08. Again, a dashed line is shown where a spline interpolation was necessary to match the low and high-frequency solutions. The behavior in the limit of low and high frequencies is identical to Equation (3.053), but the phase lag is approximately cτ ≈ 0.0874 d/x. Conclusions The investigation by Gersten followed the approach by Lighthill to a large extent. Therefore, the solution for GNu,HL are almost the same in both cases. For the skin friction, the respective solutions are also in good agreement.

The series expansion used by Gersten yields a smoother transition. For the heat transfer in the flow over a flat plate, depicted in Figure 3.08, a peak in amplitude is visible. This peak gain occurs at approximately Sr x/d ≈ 0.07 and repre- sents a distinct difference in the dynamic behavior compared to the flow close to a stagnation point. With the use of a series expansion, Gersten could work around the limita- tions of the integral treatment used by Lighthill. However, in the scope of the cylinder, the major limitations remain similar. The known solutions for wedge flow with fixed angle cannot reproduce the curvature of the cylinder and are therefore approximations for a certain region of the cylinder at best. For the Falkner–Skan equations to be valid, the mean flow Reynolds number has to be sufficiently high. Under these conditions, flow separation occurs, which cannot be handled by the current treatment. Nevertheless, the results by Gersten suggest that the dy- namic behavior of a cylinder is a mixture between that of the HL and the BL. 3.02.05 Telionis and Romaniuk Telionis summarized the advances in describing unsteady viscous flows, and a whole chapter of his book is devoted to fluctuations imposed on the steady flow. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review Both the analytical and the numerical investigations applying the boundary layer equations are discussed. Most notable for the scope of this thesis is the numerical solution of the unsteady boundary equations by Telionis and Romaniuk. Al- though no transfer function was derived, relations between fluctuating and steady temperature gradients shed some light on the heat transfer behavior. In contrast to Lighthill’ s solutions, but in agreement with Gersten, a peak in fluctuation amplitude at low Strouhal numbers was reported. 3.03 Approximation for low Reynolds Numbers To find an approximate solution for flow at low Reynolds numbers, Stokes’ equation (Stokes, 1851) can be used. In this formulation, inertia terms, which have only a small contribution, are neglected. Better solutions are to be gained with the Oseen equations (White, 2007). In these equations, inertia is included with a separate con- vective velocity. Bayly used this simplification of the incompressible Navier– Stokes equations to derive a solution for a cylinder in pulsating crossflow at low Reynolds numbers. 3.03.01 Oseen Equation The Oseen equations are a simplification of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equa- tions (cf. Equation (2.063) - (2.065)). The velocity u in the convective term is re- placed by an independent convective velocity u j (∂ui )/(∂x j ) → b j (∂ui )/(∂x j ). This amounts to a linearization of the Navier–Stokes equations around bi. The convec- tive velocity is an additional variable, and thus an equation for the outer flow is necessary to solve for all variables. Outer and inner flow are matched using a pertur- bation approach. The Oseen equations represent a significant improvement over Stokes’ equation which neglects the convective term altogether and yield accept- able results up to higher Reynolds numbers. In the first half of the 20 th century, solutions for the steady-state drag coefficient and Nußelt number were developed (White, 2007). Nevertheless, due to the linearization, this approximation leads to severely wrong results at Re & 1. Weisenborn and Mazur extended the ap- proach to yield values with acceptable accuracy for the steady-state drag even up to Reynolds numbers of order ten. 3.03.02 Bayly Bayly included the time derivatives in the Oseen equations. From this start- ing point, he developed a model for the unsteady heat transfer at very low Péclet 3.04 Navier-Stokes Equations numbers, i.e. Re·Pr ≪ 1, to be used for wires in Rijke tubes or hot-wire anemometers. Oseen’ s approximations allowed for the problem to be solved for a real cylindrical geometry. The skin friction was not addressed in the study by Bayly. If the Prandtl number is of order unity, the solution by Bayly is accurate for Re → 0. The dimensionless frequency chosen in this work is ωk ρcp u 2 ∞,0 = Sr Re Pr. (3.054) This introduces a dependence on Reynolds number not present in the models based on the boundary layer equations, e.g. by Lighthill and Gersten. Intro- ducing the perturbation parameter δ = [−ln(Re Pr) + ln(4) − γE ]−1 and neglecting terms of order O(δ3) the frequency response can be written as GNu = δ ln(1 +4 i Sr/(Re Pr)) 4 i Sr/(Re Pr), (3.055) where γE ≈ 0.0577 is the Euler constant. The perturbation parameter is chosen in such a way that a consistent perturbation theory is achieved. Moreover, it yields the most accurate solution considering the fact that higher order terms of δ are neglected. Low and high frequency limits are given by Sr → 0 : |G| =δ ∠G = 0 Sr → ∞: |G| =0 ∠G = −π/2. (3.056) This frequency response is depicted in Figure 3.09 for three different Reynolds num- bers, Re 0 = 0.001, Re 0 = 0.005, and Re 0 = 0.01. Higher Reynolds numbers lead to unreal- istically high values for the perturbation parameter δ, which is also the steady-state gain of the transfer function. 3.04 Navier-Stokes Equations With the advent of CFD, it became possible to compute solutions of the full Navier– Stokes equations. Different approaches were developed. The first numerical sim- ulations using the Navier–Stokes equations for a cylinder in unsteady flow were carried out by Apelt and Ledwich. Kwon and Lee solved the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in frequency space. This provided a very efficient method for Re.40. A unique model was developed by Nicoli and Pelcé. They solved the compressible Navier–Stokes equations in only one dimension using a series expansion with the temperature before and after the heater as expansion param- eter. Hantschk and Vortmeyer carried out time domain simulations of a complete but under-resolved thermoacoustic device. A time series analysis, in the 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 |GNu| 0 0.05 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 4-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠GNu Figure 3.09: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer (Bayly, 1985). Solutions for Pr = 0.07 and three different mean flow Reynolds numbers, Re 0 = 0.001 ( ), Re 0 = 0.005 ( ), and Re 0 = 0.01 ( ), are shown. The depicted range is restricted to Sr < 4 CFD/SI framework was conducted by Föller et al. Later, Selimefendigil et al examined the cylinder in pulsating crossflow regarding its nonlinear behav- ior. Many more numerical studies touched the subject of a cylinder in unsteady flow, but in most cases, the focus was on cycle averaged behavior or on the vortex shedding at higher Reynolds numbers. Numerical studies also included oscillations of the cylinder transverse to the flow (Pham et al, 2010) and rectangular cylinders (Yu et al, 2014). Zheng et al examined the heat transfer and the momentum transfer numer- ically with a Lattice–Boltzmann code. This method is of great interest for further development because of its potential for massively parallelized computations due to its scalability to a high number of computational cores. The investigations on monofrequent pulsations at four different frequencies and four different pulsation amplitudes yielded information on the evolution of the circumferential distribution of Nußelt number and drag coefficient. Moreover, net heat transfer enhancement was investigated. Wang et al carried out simulations similar to Hantschk and Vortmeyer. Thermoacoustic oscillations were investigated in a full-scale simulation using the Lattice–Boltzmann method. The numerical model can serve as a proof of concept but not as an accurate quantification of the physical effects. 3.04 Navier-Stokes Equations 3.04.01 Apelt and Ledwich Apelt and Ledwich carried out the first numerical simulations of a cylinder in unsteady crossflow that also included heat transfer. The Navier–Stokes equations were solved in vorticity–stream function formulation (cf. Equation (2.068) - (2.070)) on a log-polar grid. The equations were discretized with central differences and in- tegrated explicitly in time using a two-step method. Investigated Reynolds numbers were in the range 1 ≤ Re ≤ 40, i.e. below the threshold of vortex shedding. Three dif- ferent cases of unsteadiness were considered: An impulsive start from rest, a sudden increase in flow velocity from a steady state (step input), and sinusoidal pulsations (monofrequent modulation) of the free-stream velocity. Results were given as graphical representations of Nußelt number, drag coefficient, and friction coefficient over time. In response to the step input, the Nußelt number rises exponentially to its new steady-state value, similar to time lag elements in con- trol theory. The drag coefficients drop to lower values instantaneously and slowly restore to a new steady state. For the sinusoidal pulsations only one frequency was reported, and hence only one point of the frequency response function could be acquired. For this case, the amplitude reduction and enlargement for heat transfer and skin friction were reported respectively. 3.04.02 Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations The work of Kwon and Lee is of particular relevance for the present study. A vorticity–stream function formulation (cf. Section 2.02.06) was used to model in- compressible, two-dimensional flow around a heated wire. Perturbation equations were derived for the case of small amplitude harmonic perturbations and solved numerically in a two-dimensional domain. The circumferential distribution of the oscillating heat transfer amplitude, as well as amplitude and phase of the total heat transfer rate, were evaluated for flow conditions typical for a Rijke tube. The results were used, e.g. by Matveev (2003 a), because for Reynolds numbers of order unity neither Lighthill’ s nor Bayly’ s analytical solutions are valid. However, the nondimen- sional groups chosen in this work do not permit a detailed comparison since the inverse of the angular frequency was used as characteristic time instead of the ratio between cylinder diameter and unperturbed free-stream velocity (Lighthill, 1954; Gersten, 1965). The results of Kwon and Lee were translated to the set of dimensionless quan- tities used in this thesis to facilitate comparison. The values reported by Kwon and Lee were extracted and transformed. The results provided yielded a cloud in the GNu-Re 0-Sr space and a surface, linking these points, was created using linear interpolation. The accuracy of this surface depends on the given data and is not optimal at values where the original data had to be extrapolated.

Especially, the interpolated graph for Re 0 = 4 shows the distinctive features of the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer that could also be confirmed in this thesis. The concept of computing the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in frequency do- main was revisited by Lu and Papadakis (2011, 2014). The focus of this study was on the numerical method and how to apply it to any code solving the Navier–Stokes equations iteratively in the time domain. Drag forces were computed and related to an analytical expression for oscillating flow. 3.04.03 Hantschk and Vortmeyer Hantschk and Vortmeyer carried out numerical simulations solving the com- pressible Navier–Stokes equations. A complete Rijke tube like geometry was dis- cretized in two dimensions, and the flow variables were solved using a finite volume approach. With this approach, they were able to simulate the thermoacoustic insta- bilities occurring in the Rijke tube including the main physical phenomena such as heat transfer and acoustic wave propagation. The numerical model is a complete 3.04 Navier-Stokes Equations representation of the underlying mechanisms including the exponential growth of fluctuation amplitudes and the damping mechanisms causing the system to settle to a limit cycle with constant pulsations. The phase difference between velocity fluc- tuations and heat transfer fluctuations was determined to 64.08° in the investigated case. The results, however, cannot be used as a model with quantitative validity. With the coarse mesh used in that study, boundary layer effects were underresolved. The grid spacing close to the heater bands was much larger than the layer thickness assessed in Section 3.01.02. Moreover, unrealistically high temperatures had to be imposed as boundary conditions to acquire the desired thermoacoustic instabilities. This might also be attributed to the lack of spatial resolution. 3.04.04 Time Series Analysis Föller et al investigated the unsteady heat transfer of a heated cylinder in pulsating crossflow using numerical simulations to acquire data in combination with the identification of an impulse response based on the inversion of the Wiener– Hopf equation (Polifke et al, 2001). The approach was termed CFD/SI method, as it represents a combination of CFD and system identification. Ultimately, a finite impulse response (FIR) model was acquired for the heat transfer. They showed that the heat transfer dynamics depend strongly on the response times of the boundary layers. These time scales are reported to depend on Reynolds number. A number of distinct features were identified for the frequency response of the heat transfer, such as a maximum amplitude in heat transfer rate at frequencies greater than zero. Moreover, a discrepancy in the high-frequency range in comparison to Lighthill’ s predictions was found. An attempt was made to physically motivate the heat trans- fer behavior by qualitatively assessing the flow-field response close to the cylinder to a sudden increase in inlet velocity. Recently, Li et al (2016 b) used the online identification of a FIR model for the con- trol of a Rijke type burner 2. The model was built upon the pressure measurements from a microphone and hence differs from the transfer functions based on velocity pulsations in this thesis. However, the identification method is similar, and Li et al (2016 b) were able to quickly control a loudspeaker to counteract the thermoacous- tic oscillations. 2 A Rijke tube with a Bunsen burner instead of a heated wire. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review 3.05 Further Literature on Heat Transfer in Unsteady Flow This section gives a brief overview of literature regarding the wider context of the dy- namics of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. Most notably, some experimental results have been obtained for similar configurations. Very similar to pulsating crossflow is oscillating crossflow. In this case, the steady mean flow component is zero, and the amplitude is determined by the fluid displacement rather than relative to the mean flow. Flow regimes and computational methodology are, however, quite different. Another aspect of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow is the nonlinear behavior of the heat transfer at high pulsation amplitudes. Although this thesis focuses on the linear regime, i.e. small amplitudes, the nonlinear behavior is of interest for some applica- tions. Foremost, an enhancement of the net heat transfer can be caused by high amplitude fluctuations of the free-stream. 3.05.01 Experimental Investigations of Unsteady Flow Over the course of several decades, the pulsating flow across a cylinder has been investigated experimentally several times. Not least due to the requirements of the measurement equipment, most studies were carried out for flow in the “transition in shear layer” regime (cf. Table 2.01). Hori investigated the velocity profiles at an oscillating cylinder at 3600 ≤ Re ≤ 9000. Quintessence of most studies was an in- crease in net heat transfer (heat transfer enhancement) as a result of the pulsations. Base et al found a dependence of the heat transfer enhancement/reduction on frequency in the range 1220 ≤ Re ≤ 4890. Similar experiments were carried out by Perwaiz and Base (1992, 2300 ≤ Re ≤ 13 500). Moreover, the evolution of the cir- cumferential distribution was assessed by Andraka and Diller (1985, Re = 50 ×103) and Mikheev et al (2017, 0.04 ×104 ≤ Re ≤ 1.006 ×104, 0 < Sr ≤ 11). Heat transfer en- hancement up to 15 % were reported, strongly dependent on the flow condition, e.g. the Strouhal number of the pulsation. The largest deviation from the steady state occurred on the lee side of the cylinder, especially at the separation point. Sung et al investigated the circumferential distribution of the mass transfer in pulsating flow across a cylinder at 4500 ≤ Re ≤ 12 450. Investigations at lower Reynolds numbers were carried out by Li et al (2013, 71 ≤ Re ≤ 282; 1.02 ≤ Sr ≤ 16), Li et al (2016 a, 205 ≤ Re ≤ 822; 1.01 ≤ Sr ≤ 18), and Kikuchi et al (2000, Re = 400, 0 ≤ Sr ≤ 8.06). Li et al also assessed the heat transfer enhancement at different inclination angles. The circumferential distribution of the Nußelt number for Re = 400 was reported by Kikuchi et al. The increase in heat transfer is attributed to flow reversal at the lee side of the cylinder. The force of pulsating flow on a cylinder was measured by Schewe at 2.03 ×104 ≤ Re ≤ 7.01 ×106. 3.05 Further Literature on Heat Transfer in Unsteady Flow In a unique experiment, Lin et al investigated the influence of pulsation on a cylinder in a water tunnel. The Reynolds numbers were in the range 1≤ Re ≤ 5, i.e. the laminar regime without recirculation. 3.05.02 Oscillating Flow This thesis deals with pulsating flow, especially with pulsations around a steady mean flow that are small compared to the mean flow itself (c.f. Section 2.04.02). An- other related topic that was investigated in the past and still is of interest is a cylinder in oscillating flow. In this configuration, the mean flow velocity is zero or small compared to the peak velocities, and the amplitude is determined via the fluid dis- placement. Phenomenologically the largest difference to pulsating flow is that flow reversal occurs at any given amplitude. Idiosyncratic for investigations on oscillating flow is the use of the Keulegan- Carpenter number as frequency parameter. It is usually defined as the inverse of the Strouhal number or in terms of frequency as 2π/Sr. Sarpkaya investigated a cylinder in oscillating crossflow with Re = 100 evalu- ated with the maximum velocity experimentally. A threshold frequency below which the shear wave model (cf. Section 3.01.02) does not yield acceptable results was found. Other experiments were conducted by Gopinath and Harder and Iwai et al. The latter also included a numerical study and was concerned with the heat transfer enhancement in oscillatory flow. Other numerical studies were conducted by Ohmi and Usui, Uzunoglu et al, and Elston et al. 3.05.03 Nonlinearity of Heat Transfer It is emphasized that the thesis is limited to relatively small oscillation amplitudes. Specifically, the amplitude of the forced velocity perturbations was below 30 % of the mean flow velocity for all cases considered. At these amplitude levels, the dy- namic response of heat transfer to imposed velocity fluctuations expressed as the relative amplitude and phase of heat flow rate oscillations, is linear. Heckl as well as Hantschk and Vortmeyer reported this behavior investigating the Rijke tube phenomenon experimentally and numerically, respectively. Selimefendigil et al investigated the nonlinear behavior of a cylinder in pul- sating crossflow with the CFD/SI method. The nonlinear regime, i.e. at fluctuation amplitudes above 30 % of the mean flow velocity is important for the achievable amplitudes of limit cycles in a Rijke tube. The developed nonlinear models were used to predict these limit cycles (Selimefendigil and Polifke, 2011). 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review Selimefendigil and Polifke, as well as Selimefendigil et al, have studied the transition from linear to nonlinear behavior and the application of nonlinear identification methods at fluctuation amplitudes exceeding 30 % of the mean flow velocity. Algorithms for nonlinear system identification were further developed, tested and applied to problems of heat transfer by Selimefendigil and Öztop (2013, 2014). Those studies followed a “black box” approach, as is typically the case in system identification. 3.05.04 Heat Transfer Enhancement Numerical and experimental studies on the average heat transfer in pulsating flows across a cylinder (Andraka and Diller, 1985; Al-Sumaily and Thompson, 2013; Li et al, 2016 a) have shown that the influence is negligible for amplitudes smaller than one-third of the mean velocity. In the linear regime, terms that scale with the second order of oscillation amplitude may be neglected. A change in amplitude leads then to a proportional change in the response in heat transfer. Moreover, the superposi- tion principle applies. The overall response in heat transfer to a flow perturbation can be described as a straightforward sum over contributions from different physi- cal mechanisms. Papadakis and Bergeles investigated the heat transfer in pulsating flow at Re 0 = 100, i.e. in the regime of laminar periodic vortex shedding numerically. The free-steam velocity was pulsed at several forcing frequencies up to three times the natural shedding frequency f ≤ 3.05 fs 0. It was found that a lock-on of the vortex shed- ding to the pulsation frequency occurs at pulsation frequencies 1.05. f.2.04 fs 0. In this case, the actual vortex shedding differs from the natural shedding frequency in a steady flow and is approximately one half of the forcing frequency. Papadakis and Bergeles assessed the heat transfer at several locations on the circumference of the cylinder. Close to the forward stagnation point up to the point of separation, the pulsations result in an increase of the root mean square (RMS) value of the Nußelt number but not the mean Nußelt number. An increase in mean value was only observed downstream of the separation point; however, the contribution to the overall heat transfer is small. The largest heat transfer enhancement was reported for a forcing frequency of f ≈ 2.04 fs 0. The effect of vortex shedding can be seen as nonlinear with respect to the forcing as the frequency of the heat transfer variation is not necessarily the same as the forcing frequency (c.f. Section 4.01.01). However, during lock-on, heat transfer and velocity pulsations occur with the same frequency (twice the vortex shedding frequency) and hence some kind of linearization occurs. The reader should bear in mind that this thesis is not concerned with an increase (or decrease) of cycle-averaged heat transfer in pulsating or reciprocating flow, which 3.06 Rijke Tube has been observed at large pulsation amplitudes in a number of studies (Hill and Stenning, 1960; Zhao and Cheng, 1998; Dec et al, 1992; Andraka and Diller, 1985; Selimefendigil et al, 2012; Al-Sumaily and Thompson, 2013; Li et al, 2013, 2016 a). The amplitude of the imposed velocity perturbations was limited to 30 % of the mean flow velocity or less, which is in fact considerably below the threshold where changes in the average heat transfer are noticeable. 3.06 Rijke Tube The Rijke tube is the key aspect of applications in this thesis. As mentioned above, the Rijke tube was first described phenomenologically by Rijke. Rayleigh explained the thermoacoustic effect in detail by a periodic transfer of heat and a phase difference that occurs between acoustic pressure pulsations and heat transfer. The first quantification of this phase difference was proposed by Lighthill. Heckl (1988, 1990) revisited the existing literature to develop mathematical models which are widely used until now. Quite a few researchers have since also tackled the Rijke tube and its mathematical description. 3.06.01 Modeling Approaches One of the most widely used equations modeling the heat transfer between a thin wire and the surrounding fluid was given by King. The heat flux is given by Q̇ = Lw (Tw −T∞) ⎛ ⎝k +2 √︄ πk cv ρd 2 |u| ⎞ ⎠, (3.057) where Lw and Tw denote the length and the temperature of the wire, respectively. This equation is known as King’ s Law and adopts the square root relationship be- tween heat transfer and flow velocity from boundary layer theory. It should be noted, that correlations for the heat transfer as provided by Collis and Williams and Sparrow et al (cf. Equation (2.023) and Equation (2.024), respectively) offer much better accuracy than King’ s Law. Heckl linearized King’ s Law and modified it with a time-lagged velocity fluc- tuation u′(t −τ) to account for the dynamics of the heat transfer. This simple model is written as Q̇ ′ = Lw (Tw −T∞) √︄ πk cv ρd 2 u u′, (3.058) which is an application of the n −τ model, is called Modified King’ s Law. 3 Cylinder in Pulsating Flow—Literature Review The model by Lighthill for low frequencies (cf. Equation (3.034)) is a first or- der lag model (proportional with first order time lag, PT 1). The parameters are the steady-state gain K and a time constant cτ. It is used to describe the heat transfer dynamics in conjunction with the Modified King’ s Law where the time constant is not used in conjunction with a PT 1 model, but as the time lag of the n −τ model. The significance of this, which is essentially a linearization of Lighthill’ s PT 1 model is discussed in Chapter 8. For the original model by Lighthill, the parameters are K = 1/2 and τ = 0.02 d/u 0,∞. Heckl introduced empirical factors to the Modified King’ s Law to account for the heat transfer behavior at high amplitudes. These terms cause a reduction of the heat transfer amplitudes if the velocity pulsations exceed one-third of the mean flow velocity. To account for the dynamics, again the time constant τ = 0.02 d/u 0,∞ was used. This model will be referred to as Heckl’ s model in this thesis and reads Q̇ = Lw (Tw −T∞) ⎡ ⎣k +2 √︄ πk cv ρd (︄(︃ 1 − 1 ⎷ )︃√︁ u + 1⎷ √︄⃓⃓⃓⃓ u 3 +u′ ⃓⃓⃓⃓ )︄⎤ ⎦. (3.059) The fluctuating heat flux is evaluated analogous to Equation (3.058). 3.06.02 Time Constant Essential to the description of the thermoacoustic oscillations occurring in the Rijke tube is the phase lag between acoustic pulsations and heat transfer. The Modified King’ s Law (Heckl, 1988) and thus Heckl’ s Model (Heckl, 1990) modeled this as a fixed time lag. In Lighthill’ s original work (Lighthill, 1954), however, the phase lag is effectuated by a PT 1 model with a time constant. This time constant is given in the form τ = cτ d u 0,∞, (3.060) where cτ was evaluated to 0.02. Most literature concerned with the Rijke tube uses a different frame of reference. Instead of wire diameter d, and unperturbed inlet velocity u 0,∞, the length of the Rijke tube L and the speed of sound a are used for non-dimensionalization. Hence, the time constant is given by τ = c∗ τ L a (3.061) and translates to Lighthill’ s frame of reference (which is also used in this thesis) by cτ = c∗ τ L d u 0,∞ a = c∗ τ L d Ma. (3.062) For typical working conditions the factor Ma L/d is expected to be approximately of order one. 3.06 Rijke Tube 3.06.03 Literature Survey The literature survey in Table 3.01 gives an overview of some of the literature on elec- trically heated Rijke tubes. The working conditions in terms of mean flow Reynolds number and Strouhal number are also detailed. The Reynolds number and the Strouhal number refer to the diameter of the wire. The frequency used was that of the occurring oscillations. If no specific frequency was given, the fundamental frequency of the tube used in the experiments or computations was considered. If a model was used for the unsteady heat transfer, this is listed in the table including the time constant cτ necessary for the dynamics of the heat transfer. Unfortunately, many publications are unspecific about the frame of reference that has been used. The column for the time constant was assembled to the best of the author’ s abilities.

The values in Table 3.01 show that typical Reynolds numbers for the mean flow around a heated wire investigated in studies are in the range. Strouhal num- bers are usually of order one but can be as high as 12.06. This underlines the necessity for a model for the heat transfer dynamics covering these ranges, which cannot be provided by the existing models, e.g. by Lighthill and Bayly. 3 Private communication, 2016 4 Linear Dynamic Systems In science and engineering, it is in many cases beneficial to divide problems in smaller parts and concentrate on one specific part instead of trying to find a descrip- tion for a phenomenon encompassing all different aspects simultaneously. Such a part is called a system, whereas the remaining aspects represent the environment (Pintelon and Schoukens, 2012). The concept of systems is widely used in many research areas (Söderström and Stoica, 1989), e.g. physics, biology, engineering, economics (Heij et al, 2006; Goldberger, 1991) as well as in social sciences and psy- chology (Köhler, 2008). Within a system, different variables influence each other on multiple time and space scales (Keesman, 2011; Ljung, 1999). A system may interact with the environment (Pintelon and Schoukens, 2012) through signals and is then referred to as open system (Keesman, 2011).1 If signals change over time (Verhaegen and Verdult, 2007), the system is specified as a dynamic system. Signals can be distinguished into inputs, outputs, and disturbances. Outputs y are the products or the responses of a system. Hence, they are called endogenous. These signals are observable or measurable by an agent. Inputs u are exogenous signals that can be manipulated by an agent. Disturbances cannot be manipulated. They occur from the influence of the environment on the system, within the system itself, or are caused by the errors in measurements. A representation of a system with input and output is given in Figure 4.01. Systems can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs interacting with each other. Systems with only one input and one output are denoted single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Accordingly, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems have more than one input and more than one output. Analogously, systems can also be termed SIMO and MISO (Hespanha, 2009). This thesis is mostly concerned with SIMO systems. The input is the pulsation of the freestream velocity (as Re ′) and outputs are heat transfer fluctuation (as Nu ′) and shear stress fluctuation (as c′ f ). However, this particular SIMO system can be split into two SISO systems by considering only one output at a time. Therefore, descrip- tions are given for SISO systems, if not marked otherwise, but may also apply—with some generalization—to MIMO systems. To understand and describe a complex system, occurring in nature or technical de- vices, a model of some sort is sought. Modeling is used in many branches of science 1 In contrast to closed systems which do not interact with the environment according to this definition. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems u(t) y(t) environment system Figure 4.01: Representation of a General (Open) System.Input(s) u and output(s) y and engineering (Söderström and Stoica, 1989). The main aims are to aid in the design process as well as to estimate, control, and monitor systems (Tangirala, 2014; Söderström and Stoica, 1989). Söderström and Stoica distinguish three main types of models: (1) mental, intuitive or verbal models, (2) graphs and tables, and (3) mathematical models. Graphs and tables may be used to represent systems in a comprehensible manner. Differential and difference equations (and similar representations) are mathemati- cal models. However, many different ways to classify systems exist and the above- mentioned list is by far not exhaustive. In this chapter, basic modeling concepts of linear time invariant dynamic models are introduced in Section 4.01. Subsequently in Section 4.02, different concepts of data used in the modeling process are presented. These concepts lead to different model representations demonstrated in Section 4.03. Section 4.04 deals with the sys- tem identification process employed to build models from acquired data and finally techniques to validate identified models are shown in Section 4.05. The last section of this chapter (i.e. Section 4.06) shows how system theory is applied to the dynamics of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. 4.01 Linear Time Invariant Systems The notion of a linear and time invariant (LTI) system is important for the applica- tion of system theory. A large set of methods exists to describe and process this type of system. The assumptions involved—linearity and time invariance—are often jus- tified, or situations can be found when an LTI description is sufficiently accurate. In these cases, considerations based on linear theory lead to good results (Ljung, 1999). 4.01 Linear Time Invariant Systems 4.01.01 Definition An LTI system is defined by two characteristics: linearity and time invariance. Time invariance implies system characteristics do not change with time and thus its re- sponse to a certain input signal does not depend on absolute time (Ljung, 1999). This means that an arbitrary operator f, representing the system dynamics, applied to a signal shifted in time yields the same result but with the same shift in time as the signal. This can be represented by If u(t) f −→y(t), then u(t −τ) f −→y(t −τ) (4.01) where u and y denote input time series and result time series of a time invariant operation f and τ is a constant shift time (Tangirala, 2014). A system, represented by the operator f, is considered linear if its response to a linear combination (sum) of inputs is the same as the linear combination of the re- sponses to the individual inputs (Ljung, 1999). This holds, even if a constant scaling factor is applied and can be written by f (a u 1 +u 2) = a f (u 1) + f (u 2) (4.02) where u 1 and u 2 are the variables, f is the linear operation, and a is a constant (Tangirala, 2014). Linearity implies that the principles of homogeneity (multiplica- tion with a constant factor) and superposition (addition of inputs) hold. The latter explicitly allows any complex time series to be decomposed into simpler signals, e.g. individual impulses. The linearity requirement may be violated due to constant offsets in input and output. In this case, linear models can relate deviation variables that vary around a nominal operating point. These offsets are estimated (mean) and removed to achieve a linear equation, e.g. (y − y 0) = f (u −u 0) (4.03) where y 0 and u 0 denote the (quasi-)steady state of output and input, respectively (Tangirala, 2014). Generally, the linear model may consist of a first-order Taylor’ s series approximation of the nonlinear system around a steady state (cf. Section 2.04) (Tangirala, 2014). 4.01.02 Properties LTI systems exhibit two general properties important for modeling purposes: causality/non-causality and stability/instability. A suitable model has to reflect these properties, e.g. a model should be non-causal if the system is non-causal. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Causality If the response at a certain time depends only on the input up to this instant in time, i.e. it does not depend on ”future“ values, then the system is called causal. A system in which the past, present, and future inputs are involved is referred to as non-causal (Ljung, 1999). Stability The assumption of stability implies that the response of a system will not grow in- definitely. More precisely, an LTI system is said to be stable, if all bounded-inputs yield bounded-outputs (Tangirala, 2014). This is the concept of a BIBO stable system which is a standard definition for LTI system. BIBO stability is denoted by ∥y(t)∥ < ∞for all ∥u(t)∥ < ∞. (4.04) This is important for the modeling process as a model for a stable system should also be stable (Tangirala, 2014). If a steady state exists, this indicates that the system is stable (Tangirala, 2014). 4.01.03 Convolution Model and Impulse Response A model should relate an input (function) to an output (function) by a mathematical operation. For an LTI system, this can be achieved using the convolution operation. From the pointwise multiplication of a function with another (shifted) function in- tegrated over the shift variable a third function results. This can be written as y(t) = ∞∫︂ −∞ g (τ)u(t −τ)dτ = g (t) ∗u(t). (4.05) This type of model is referred to as convolution model and is the most fundamental representation of an LTI system (Tangirala, 2014). The third function involved,g (τ), is called impulse response function. This is due to the fact that this is the response generated by the system when excited with a unit impulse (Dirac δ function, the neutral element of the convolution) defined by δ(t) ≡ 0 for all t ̸= 0 and ∞∫︂ −∞ δ(t)dt = 1. (4.06) 4.01 Linear Time Invariant Systems The impulse response exhaustively describes the dynamic behavior of an LTI system (Keesman, 2011). It is equivalent to the concept of Green’ s Functions (Duffy, 2001). For a causal system with zero initial conditions, the convolution model is given by y(t) = t∫︂ g (τ)u(t −τ)dτ (4.07) using only information from a start time “0” up to the current time t. The foundation of the impulse response function is the superposition principle. It states that the response of a linear system to the simultaneous action of several causes is obtained by first determining the effects of the separate causes and then adding them in the proper manner (cf. definition of linearity and time invariance). If a system is BIBO stable, then the impulse response is absolutely convergent (Tan- girala, 2014). This can be expressed as ∞∫︂ −∞ g (t)dt < ∞. (4.08) 4.01.04 Transfer Function Causal convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the Laplace domain (Keesman, 2011). Applying the Laplace transform (Phillips et al, 2008) defined by F (s) = L{f (t)} = ∞∫︂ f (t)e−st dt (4.09) with the complex-valued frequency parameter s = σ+i ω to input u(t), output y(t), and impulse response function g (t), Equation (4.05) can be written as Y (s) =G(s) ·U (s). (4.010) The frequency parameter s ∈ C is a complex-valued quantity with the angular fre- quency ω as imaginary part and the growth rate σ as real part. G(s), which is the Laplace transform of the impulse response function g (t), is called transfer function. For convenience, the notation y =Gu (4.011) is introduced. It reads “the linear operator G, representing the LTI system, is applied to u”. The operator G has to be in the same domain as the signals y and u. This is the fundamental representation of dynamic behavior used in this thesis. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems u(t) y(t) v(t) system Figure 4.02: Representation of a General (Open) System with Disturbance.Input(s) u, output(s) y, and a disturbance v. Based on Söderström and Stoica. 4.01.05 Disturbances In dealing with real systems, the mapping from input to output may not be perfect, yet disturbances can influence the system. Among these disturbances are measure- ment noise and uncontrollable inputs. In general, they represent the influence of the environment on the system. These disturbances have to be taken into account as they effect the quality of the model. Different authors categorize disturbances in various ways, but most distinguish two types. An input disturbance w is characterized by the fact that it is an exogenous signal originating from the environment and directly affecting the behavior of the system (Keesman, 2011). It can be measured (Ljung, 1999; Tangirala, 2014) and it has external causes (Isermann and Münchhof, 2011), i.e. the influence of the en- vironment on the system. In contrast, the output disturbance v (Keesman, 2011) is an exogenous signal that affects the output but cannot be manipulated like the input. This disturbance is not measured (Tangirala, 2014), but may be observed due to its impact on the output (Ljung, 1999). It can also be interpreted as inter- nal disturbance (Isermann and Münchhof, 2011). A distinction between measured disturbance w and inputs u is often less important for the system identification process (Ljung, 1999). Thus, w is omitted in the following sections. Figure 4.01 above depicts a system that is only influenced by inputs. This corresponds to a purely deterministic model. However, in the scope of disturbances, a more re- alistic system is shown in Figure 4.02. A stochastic disturbance v(t) is included to account for unpredictable signals. 4.01 Linear Time Invariant Systems u(t) y(t)v(t) deterministic x(t) e(t) stochastic Figure 4.03: Representation of a General Model for an LTI System. Input(s) u, out- put(s) y, disturbance v, undisturbed output x(t), and white noise e(t). Based on Tangirala. Modeling a System with Disturbances To account for disturbances in the model representations of any given LTI system, disturbances v(t) are added to the right-hand side of Equation (4.05). The outputy(t) is then the sum of a disturbance-free output x(t) and the disturbance written as y(t) = x(t) +v(t). (4.012) The noise free deterministic model is given by x(t) =Gu (t) (4.013) where G is the representation of the deterministic part of the system, i.e. transfer function, applied to the input. The disturbance itself is unpredictable, i.e. it origi- nates from white noise, but may be colored. This is denoted by v(t) = He (t) (4.014) where H is a model for the noise spectrum applied to the white noise sequencee(t). Figure 4.03 depicts these relationships. Following Tangirala (2014, p. 14), the continuous time description is widely used for deterministic systems. Stochastic influences, i.e. disturbances, are quantified in a discrete time frame as they are picked up by sensors usually working in discrete time. This is in accordance with Ljung (1999, p. 233) who regards continuous time white noise descriptions as delicate mathematical objects. He suggests dealing with hybrid models, where the noise is handled in discrete time. Nevertheless, Beygi and Dounavis reported an approach to include noise modeling using an in- strumental variable method. In this thesis a purely discrete time point of view was adopted whenever disturbance or noise modeling was of importance. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems White Noise and Colored Noise The disturbance v is generally any kind of signal not part of the deterministic system and therefore, by definition, unpredictable. To account for this, it is deduced from a random signal e(t) and filtered by a model for the stochastic part H (c.f. Equa- tion (4.014)). The random signal is often modeled as white noise (Tangirala, 2014). It is a sequence of uncorrelated variables with zero mean (stationary) and finite variance. A useful assumption is that the variables follow a normal distribution N with variance σ2 e. This is denoted by e[k] ∼ N (0,σ2 e ) (4.015) and is called Gaussian white noise (GWN). Signal–to–Noise Ratio The signal–to–noise ratio (SNR) is a measure for the strength of the (true) response of the system compared to the noise. A high SNR is paramount for all estimation methods to achieve good models. The overall SNR is evaluated as the ratio of the variances of output and noise given by SNR = σ2 x σ2 v. (4.016) A frequency dependent estimate can be found by using the asymptotic ensemble av- erage of the power spectral density (PSD) γ. The SNR is defined in frequency domain as SNR(ω) = γxx (ω) γv v(ω) (4.017) where γxx and γv v are the PSDs of the noise-free output and the noise, respectively (Tangirala, 2014). Coherence The coherence is used to determine if a linear relationship between two signals exists. It is given by |κyu (ω)|2 = ⃓⃓⃓⃓⃓ γyu (ω) √︁γuu (ω)γy y(ω) ⃓⃓⃓⃓⃓ = 1 1 +1/SNR(ω). (4.018) 4.02 Data Basis If the coherence is not unity |κyu (ω)|2 ̸= 1 this can cave two reasons. (1) u and y depend on each other non-linearly or (2) the linear relationship is hidden by a high noise level. This is shown in Equation (4.018), where the coherence is linked to the SNR. These measures are used to determine a priori if good estimates can be expected at certain frequency ranges when estimating an LTI model. 4.02 Data Basis Information on systems can be acquired from various sources and in different frameworks. Most commonly, it can be distinguished between time and frequency domain as well as between discrete and continuous data. These concepts are impor- tant for data handling and data manipulation. 4.02.01 Continuous and Discrete Time Data Time is usually experienced as continuous and variables evolving over time are thus modeled as continuous variables. Many concepts, i.e. differential equations, are based on the notion of continuity. However, measurements are usually snapshots taken at certain instants in time. Successive measurements may be acquired distinct intervals of time apart. Thus, the variable is observed at discrete sampling instants. This concept, in contrast to continuous time, is called discrete time. In numerical computations of unsteady processes, only solutions at discrete instants in time are calculated. Sampling The transformation from continuous time to discrete time is called sampling. Dis- crete values are picked from a continuous time series in intervals called sampling times. In the case of periodic sampling, the temporal spacing between sampling instants is constant. This time Ts is referred to as the sampling interval with [Ts ] = time units per sample. It can be seen as one time unit. Any sampled instant is writ- ten in continuous time by t = k Ts with k = 0, 1,N − 1 where N is the total number of samples. Accordingly, a sampling frequency is defined by Fs = 1/Ts with [Fs ] = samples/time (Tangirala, 2014) and ωs = 2πFs = 2π/Ts for the angular fre- quency, respectively. One of the most important statements in signal processing is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem (Åström and Wittenmark, 1997). It states that for a given sam- pling frequency Fs perfect reconstruction of a signal (in continuous time) is possible for a bandlimit of FNy = Fs /2. The term bandlimit refers to a finite frequency above 4 Linear Dynamic Systems which the power spectral density of the signal is zero. The frequency FNy is called the Nyquist frequency. Similarly, the Nyquist rate, at which a bandlimited signal has to be sampled, is 2 FNy. If the sampling theorem is violated, aliasing occurs. Frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency appear as lower frequencies falsifying the signal. This defect can- not be recovered a posteriori and has to be avoided, e.g. by low-pass filtering a signal before (down-)sampling. (Tangirala, 2014) Sampling (with zero-order hold) has an impact on the definition of causality of a system. Although a system is still considered causal, if no future inputs affect the output, the term strict causality is introduced (Tangirala, 2014). It also excludes in- stantaneous effects at time k = 0 which are “unphysical” in a sense that if input and output are measured at the same instant, any signal would have to travel infinitely fast in order to cause a response at k = 0. Reconstruction A common way to transform a discrete time signal to continuous time is to hold the discrete value for Ts and then assume the next discrete value. This is called zero-order hold (ZOH). Analogously, the first-order hold (FOH) interpolates linearly between two successive values. This, however, is only possible, if the next value is already known. 4.02.02 Frequency Domain In contrast to the time domain, the frequency domain does not quantify the evolu- tion of a signal but the recurrence of patterns. The most versatile representation of the frequency domain is the s-domain or Laplace domain. For periodic signals, i.e. a superposition of sine waves, the Fourier transform was established. In the discrete framework, both concepts are represented by the Z -domainand the discrete Fourier transform, respectively. Laplace Domain A signal in s-domain is the function of a complex-valued frequency variable s = σ +iω, where σ is a growth rate specifying the (exponential) change in amplitude and ω is the frequency. The Laplace transform converts a function in the time domain to the frequency domain. It is defined in Equation (4.09) and (originally) restricted to functions of t with t > 0 (unilateral Laplace transform). The inverse Laplace transform is denoted L−1. 4.02 Data Basis Fourier Transform The continuous Fourier transform is similar to the Laplace transform with two ma- jor differences: The Fourier transform is evaluated for −∞ <t < ∞rather than starting at zero, which would be equivalent to a bilateral Laplace transform. Further- more, the complex-valued argument s is reduced to i ω, i.e. the growth rate σ = 0. Thus, it can only represent stable systems (Tangirala, 2014). The Fourier transform is defined as fˆ (ω) = F{f [k]} = +∞∫︂ −∞ e−iωt f (t)dt. (4.019) The result of a Fourier transformation is called the frequency domain representa- tion of f (t). It can be interpreted as the amplitude and the phase shift at a certain frequency ω. In discrete time, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) exists. The DTFD for- mally requires an infinitely long input signal. Hence, for computational purposes, the signal is assumed to be periodic, and the corresponding technique is called discrete Fourier transform (DFT) given by fˆ N (ω) = 1⎷ N N −1∑︂ k=0 f [k] e−iωd l (4.020) for a sampled signal f [k]) with k = 0, 1, 2,N −1. Discrete angular frequency is given by ωd = 2πl/N with l = 0, 1, 2,N −1. Several computationally very efficient algorithms called fast Fourier transform (FFT) had been developed to perform the DFT (Phillips et al, 2008). The squared magnitude of the Fourier transform scaled with the number of samples |fˆ (ω)|2/N is called periodogram. It is an estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) γf f of f (t). Similar techniques, like Welch’ s PSD estimate, deliver smooth values for the PSD. Z -Domain Like the Laplace transform for the continuous time, a conversion from discrete time to a complex-valued frequency domain representation exists. It is called (unilateral) Z-transform and is defined by F [z] = Z{f [k]} = ∞∑︂ k=0 f [k]z−k. (4.021) Substituting z = es Ts shows that it is equivalent to the Laplace transform in discrete time. z−1 can be seen as e −s Ts, which is the Laplace transform of a unit delay, thus z−1 can be interpreted as a delay operator (Keesman, 2011). 4 Linear Dynamic Systems The DFT can be achieved using z = eiωTs and the bilateral Z-transform summing from −∞ to ∞. 4.02.03 Transformations Between Laplace- and Z-Domain The transformation between the discrete Z -domain and the continuous s-domain is achieved by using numerical approximations. The most basic method is Euler’ s approximation (Ljung, 1999) s ≈ z −1 Ts and z ≈ 1 +s Ts. (4.022) Tustin’ s method uses bilinear transform to approximate this relationship with (Ljung, 1999; Tangirala, 2014) z ≈ 1 +s Ts /2 1 −s Ts /2 and s ≈ 2 Ts z −1 z +1. (4.023) Tustin’ s method is a conformal mapping preserving stability. Features in the transfer function may shift in frequency but neither in gain nor phase. This frequency shift is negligible at low frequencies but substantial at frequencies close to the Nyquist fre- quency. An overview of the relations between different domains and transformation summarizing this section is given in Figure 4.04. 4.03 Representations of LTI Systems Transformations between different types of data and mathematical manipula- tions allow various representations of LTI systems. These representations, although equivalent in most aspects, can have advantages for certain applications. All rep- resentations shown in this thesis are of input-output type. Other types, e.g. state- space representations will not be discussed here. 4.03.01 Continuous Time Transfer Function The continuous time transfer function was introduced in Section 4.01.04 as Y (s) =G(s) ·U (s). (4.010) It is often used to represent deterministic systems. Disturbances are not regarded in this approach. 4.03 Representations of LTI Systems continuous time discrete time Lapace domain Z-domain t k z s ZOH/FOH sampling bilinear transform bilinear transform L Z L −1 Z−1 Figure 4.04: Overview of Different Domain Representations. The transforms link- ing these representations are included. The most common mathematical representation is a rational function, i.e. a fraction of two polynomials in the frequency parameter s: G(s) = bm sm +···+ b 1 s +b 0 an sn +an−1 sn−1 +···+ a 1 s +a 0 = m∑︁ i =1 bi si +b 0 n∑︁ j =1 a j s j +a 0 (4.024) where {bi } and { a j } are the (usually real valued) model coefficients (parameters) of numerator and denominator, respectively. The roots of the numerator polynomial and denominator polynomial are the ze- ros and poles of the transfer function, respectively. They provide insight on certain properties of the transfer function, e.g. information on stability. Factorization of Equation (4.024) yields G(s) = K · (s −β1)(s −β2)··· (s −βm) (s −α1)(s −α2)··· (s −αn) = K m∏︁ i =1 (s −βi ) n∏︁ j =1 (s −αj ) (4.025) where {βi } are the zeros and {αj } the roots of the transfer function. The coefficient K represents a constant scaling factor. In contrast to the polynomial coefficients, roots and poles are often complex-valued. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Using partial fraction decomposition, the continuous time transfer function (Equa- tion (4.024)) can be written as G(s) = r 1 s −α1 + r 2 s −α2 +···+ rn s −αn +d = n∑︂ j =1 r j s −αj +d. (4.026) Here, {αj } are again the poles of the transfer function. The residues of the decom- position are denoted { r j } and a constant additive component d exists. It denotes the response at infinite frequency G(s → ∞) = d and is usually zero in any system occurring in nature. However, models including a non-vanishing coefficient d may be valid in a certain frequency range and may possess other desirable features like better accuracy at lower order N. Note that d = 0 corresponds to b 0 = 0 in the poly- nomial representation (Equation (4.024)). 4.03.02 Discrete Time Transfer Function Similar to the continuous time approach but including disturbances, the general discrete time model is given by y[k] =G(q)u[k] +H(q)e[k]. (4.027) Choosing polynomials to model the dynamics, the most general description of an input-output system in discrete time is given by A(q)y[k] = B(q) F (q) u[k −nk ] + C (q) D(q)e[k] (4.028) with the polynomials A(q) = 1 +a 1 q−1 +a 2 q−2 +···+ ana q−na, (4.029) B(q) = b 0 +b 1 q−1 +b 2 q−2 +···+ b(nb −1)q−(nb −1), (4.030) C (q) = 1 +c 1 q−1 +c 2 q−2 +···+ cnc q−nc, (4.031) D(q) = 1 +d 1 q−1 +d 2 q−2 +···+ dnd q−nd, and (4.032) F (q) = 1 + f 1 q−1 + f 2 q−2 +···+ fn f q−n f. (4.033) The shift operator ( q−n x[k] = x[k −n]) is used to relate to past inputs and outputs. The parameters of the model are denoted by { ai }, { b j }, { ck }, { dl }, and { fm}. The constants na, nb, nc, nd, and n f are the numbers of free parameters each the poly- nomial. They correspond to the model orders, except in the case of B, where the order is nb − 1. This is due to a free parameter, denoted by b 0, corresponding to an instantaneous feedthrough from input to output similar to d in Equation (4.026). nk is a time delay which is assumed zero in all models here and therefore omitted henceforth. 4.03 Representations of LTI Systems Note that at least A or D and F must be unity in order to maintain uniqueness of the representation. Additionally, if no model for the disturbance is sought,C and D may be set to unity. The shift operator q is directly linked to the z variable of the Z transform introduced in Section 4.02.02 and any method or rule directly applies. 4.03.03 Unit Impulse Response The unit impulse response is a time domain model. It shows the response to the Dirac delta function as defined in equation (4.06) in continuous time. The equivalent in discrete time is a unit impulse: uδ[k] = {︄ Ts, k = 0 0, k ̸= 0. (4.034) The convolution model in discrete time can be written as y[k] = ∞∑︂ n=−∞ g [n]u[k −n]. (4.035) Physically, the impulse response can be interpreted as contribution of the input at each individual instant in time to the immediate output. 4.03.04 Unit Step Response Similarly to the unit impulse response, the unit step response gives the cumulated contribution at each instant in time. The step response is the output acquired in answer to a Heaviside step function given by Θ(t) = {︄ 0, t < 0 1, t ≥ 0. (4.036) Inserting in the convolution equation yields yΘ(t) = ∞∫︂ −∞ g (τ)Θ(t −τ)dτ. (4.037) The Heaviside step function Θ is the integral of the Dirac delta function. Analo- gously, the step response is the integral of the impulse response. Assuming the system is causal (g (t < 0) = 0), the step response is given by yΘ(t) = h(t) = t∫︂ g (τ)dτ. (4.038) 4 Linear Dynamic Systems In discrete time, the unit step function is given by u[k] = {︄ 0, k < 0 1, k ≥ 0 (4.039) and the step response is therefore, for a causal system, computed with h[k] = k∑︂ n=0 g [n]. (4.040) The step response is an important time domain model, because it is rather easy to obtain in most cases, e.g. when the SNR is not too low. In the scope of CFD, much better results are obtained using a step input instead of an impulse. The impulse response (i.e. the convolution model) can always be acquired by computing the derivative g = (dh)/(dt), e.g. using finite differences. g [k] = h[k] −h[k −1] Ts. (4.041) Information on three main characteristics of a system can be deduced from the step response. The steady-state gain K, also referred to D.C. gain in the context of electronic circuits, is given by K = h[k → ∞]. (4.042) It is also equal to the frequency response in the low frequency limit G(s → 0). The characteristic time constant of a system cτ can be acquired from the rise time. Although multiple time scales may play a role in a system, a first order approxima- tion, with one dominant time scale, is the time the system needs to reach 63.021 % (1 −e−1 = 0.06321) of the steady-state gain K cτ = h−1[0.06321 K ]. (4.043) Another common definition, the rise time from 10 % to 90 % of the steady-state gain is not investigated further in this thesis. The third important characteristic is the time delay, i.e. the time until the output h is significantly different from zero. No delay is expected for the systems examined in this thesis hence no attention is given to this property. 4.03.05 Frequency Response The frequency response is based on the response to a sinusoidal input given by u(t) = A eiωt (4.044) 4.03 Representations of LTI Systems with constant amplitude A and frequency ω. The response is given by yω(t) = A ∞∫︂ −∞ g (τ) eiω(t−τ) dτ. (4.045) Frequency Response Function The frequency response function is deduced from Equation (4.045) by expanding the exponent of the exponential function: yω(t) = A eiωt ∞∫︂ −∞ g (τ) e−iωτ dτ. (4.046) The term A eiωt is the original input and therefore the response function can be written by G(eiω) = ∞∫︂ −∞ g (τ) e−iωτ dτ. (4.047) It is linked to the Laplace transform of the impulse response withs = σ+iω through σ = 0, i.e. zero growth rate. Bode Plot The Bode plot consists of a magnitude plot |G(iω)| and a phase plot ∠G(iω) of the frequency response G(i ω). Although often depicted as log-log plot and lin-log plot, respectively, it will be shown with linear axis scaling in this thesis predominantly as it is custom for flame transfer functions (Polifke, 2014). Figure 4.05 shows the magni- tude and phase of the exemplary transfer function G(s) = 1/(1+0.02 s). The frequency response constituting the Bode plot is highlighted in red. 4.03.06 Differential/Difference Equation A general differential equation model can be given by am dm y(t) dtm +···+ a 1 dy(t) dt + y(t) = b 0 u(t) +b 1 dy(t) dt +bn dn u(t) dtn (4.048) with the parameters { am} and {bn}. In discrete time, this can be written as a differ- ence equation. y[k] + na∑︂ m=1 am y[k −m] = nb∑︂ n=0 bnu[k −n]. (4.049) 4 Linear Dynamic Systems −4−2024 0 10 20 30 40 0.05 1.05 σ ω |G(s)| −4−2024 0 10 20 30 40 -π -π/2 π/2 π σ ω ∠G(s) Figure 4.05: Amplitude and Phase of the Transfer Function 1/(1 + 0.02 s). The fre- quency response (σ = 0) is highlighted in red. The parameters {am} and {bn} of the discrete time representation are not the same as in the continuous time but they are related through the sampling time. The difference equation is a parametric model. In contrast to the convolution model, the impulse response is parametrized with { am} and {bn}. Expanding Equa- tion (4.049) and inserting y[k −1] recursively with zero initial conditions yields y[k] = b 0 u[k] +(b 1 −a 1 b 0)u[k −1] +(b 2 −b 1 a 1 +a 2 1 b 0 −a 2 b 0)u[k −2] +. (4.050) The number of past outputs that affect the system nb is also called the input mem- ory. Likewise, the number of past outputs na may be seen as the system’ s memory and determines the order of the parametric model (Tangirala, 2014). The difference equation representation is also able to handle time delays, i.e. the number of time 4.04 System Identification instants passing before the input affects the output. Such time delays are not rele- vant for the models developed in this thesis and thus will be omitted. 4.04 System Identification A model mimics the behavior of a system with respect to certain requirements and restrictions. With a model, the output of a system can be predicted from known inputs. The subject of SI is concerned with the inverse process: To acquire a model for a system from known input and output data. In his introduction, Ljung even states that “Inferring models from observations and studying their properties is really what science is about.” The process of SI is very general and widely known in different fields such as elec- trical engineering, economy, and psychology. SI is used when processes are either too complex to gain insight using first principles, i.e. physical laws, or the calcu- lation is too costly in terms of time or resources. Its goal is to obtain an efficient and accurate model for a process from acquired data. The properties of this model can be analyzed to get insight in the process, or the model may be used for further calculations. Overviews of a wide variety of SI methods are given in a number of books. The work of Söderström and Stoica is a very complete collection of theory on SI developed systematically since the 1960 s. A milestone is the book by Ljung. It includes many useful methods explained on a mathematical level. Heij et al also approached the theme of SI from a mathematical viewpoint. The focus of Pin- telon and Schoukens is on the frequency domain. Very complete and detailed insight is provided by the more recent work by Tangirala. A more practical point of view is assumed by Keesman as well as Isermann and Münchhof. Verhaegen and Verdult focused on state-space models but include insight also for input–output models. 4.04.01 Identification Procedure The essential steps in SI are data acquisition, model estimation, and model valida- tion. Data acquisition can be further divided into the design of the experiments and the execution of the experiments. The term experiment also refers to numerical sim- ulations. Model estimation also has two components: The choice of model structure and the estimation of parameters. Figure 4.06 shows a more detailed flow chart of the procedure. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems design of experiment perform experiment choose model estimate parameters model validation model accepted new data set a priori knowledge yes no start end Figure 4.06: Flowchart of the Identification Procedure. Adopted from Söderström and Stoica. 4.04 System Identification 4.04.02 Parameter Estimation The estimation of the parameters of the chosen model type is a key process in the SI process. A great variety of model types, i.e. representations of LTI systems, exists. Some very common model types, which are of interest in this thesis, are given in Section 4.03. The estimated output yˆ(n) to an independent variable n of any model of these types is written as yˆ(n) = ϕ(n,θ)θ (4.051) where ϕ(n,θ) is the row vector of p regressors and θ is the column vector of un- known model coefficients (parameters), one for every entry in the regressor vector. Estimated quantities are denoted by a hat ( ·ˆ), e.g. the estimated output computed from the model equation is yˆ. The independent variable is designated n here to give credit to the fact that generally any variable can be used here. In the scope of dynamic models the independent variable, however, is usually continuous time t, discrete time k or frequency Sr. The notation ϕ(n,θ)θ reflects the fact that the vector of regressors may depend on the coefficients. Measurements, e.g. an input signal, are usually available as discrete values. These values can be assembled in vectors allowing for a matrix notation of Equation (4.051). The vector of n = 1,N estimated outputs yˆ is then given by yˆ = Ψθ (4.052) where Ψ is the observation or regressor matrix written as Ψ= [︁ ϕ(1,θ) ϕ(2,θ) ··· ϕ(N,θ) ]︁T. (4.053) The regressor matrix is an N × p matrix comprised of the available data, e.g. the inputs and outputs of the system. Each row corresponds to one available data point and each column corresponds to one coefficient. The (linear) equation system is over-determined and cannot be solved directly. To find an approximate solution the residuals given by ε = y − yˆ = y −Ψθ (4.054) have to be minimized. By inspecting Equation (4.054), it can be seen that Ψ is the Jacobian matrix of the residuals—a key feature in many optimization algorithms (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). Theleast squares minimization problem can be written as argmin θ N∑︂ n=1 (y(n) −ϕ(n,θ)θ)2 (4.055) which is equal to minimizing the sum of squared residuals (hence the name). 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Ordinary Least Squares The ordinary least squaresmethod (OLS), also called the linear least squares method, is a basic approach in SI that is also the underlying technique for many more ad- vanced procedures. In this case, the regressors ϕ(n) are independent of the coeffi- cients and the regressor matrix (Equation (4.053)) is denoted by Φ. To facilitate the estimation of the parameters θˆ, a cost function V is defined as V (θ) = N∑︂ n=1 ε(n)2. (4.056) In vector notation, this reads V (θ) = εT ε = (︁ y T −θT ΦT )︁(︁ y −θΦ )︁. (4.057) The cost function is convex and therefore, a minimum of V can be found where its derivative with respect to the coefficients is zero: ∂V (θ) ∂θ = −2ΦT y +2ΦT Φθ = 0 (4.058) This leads to the so-called normal equations given by ΦT Φθ = ΦT y. (4.059) The expression ΦT Φ denotes the Hessian matrix of V. Mathematically, it is also the Gramian matrix of Φ and the product ΦT y is the moment matrix of regressand by regressors. The solution of the OLS problem is given by θˆ = (︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1 ΦT y (4.060) where Φ† = (︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1 ΦT is also known as Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of the ma- trix Φ. Instead of using the normal equations, the OLS problem can be solved using QR - factorization (Nocedal and Wright, 2006; Golub and Van Loan, 2013) which results in a better conditioning of the problem. The QR -factorization of the matrixΦwhich is N ×p is defined as Φ=QR = [︁ Q 1 Q 2 ]︁[︃R 1 ]︃ =Q 1 R 1 (4.061) where Q is an orthogonal matrix of size N ×N with QT Q = I. R is an upper triangular martix of size N × p. Only the first p rows of R are nonzero, so a square matrix R 1 with p ×p can be constructed. Analogously, the matrix Q 1 is N ×p and contains only the first p columns of Q. The solution of the OLS with QR -factorization problem is given by θˆ = R−1 1 (QT 1 y). (4.062) 4.04 System Identification Weighted Least Squares As an addition to the OLS method, the rows of Φ (and y accordingly) can be weighted. This is advantageous, e.g. if only a certain frequency range is of interest or variance information on measurements is available. It results in the weighted least squares (WLS) method (Franklin et al, 1997; Golub and Van Loan, 2013; Isermann and Münchhof, 2011; Keesman, 2011; Ljung, 1999; Pintelon and Schoukens, 2012; Tangirala, 2014; Verhaegen and Verdult, 2007). Parameter estimation is then given by θˆ = (︁ ΦT W Φ )︁−1 ΦT W y (4.063) with weighting matrix W. Often the weighting matrix is diagonal with weights { ρi }, but also filter operations can be realized in W. Using the WLS method is equivalent to pre-filtering the data as can be shown by (︂⎷ W Φ )︂T (︂⎷ W Φ )︂ θˆ = (︂⎷ W Φ )︂T (︂⎷ W y )︂ (4.064) where (︁⎷ W y )︁ is the pre-filtered output and (︁⎷ W Φ )︁ the pre-filtered regression ma- trix. Regularization Tikhonov regularization is often used to solve ill-posed or ill-conditioned linear equation systems. The general solution of a regularized least squares problem reads θˆ = (︁ ΦT Φ+ΓT Γ )︁−1 ΦT y (4.065) with the regularization matrix Γ(Söderström and Stoica, 1989; Golub and Van Loan, 2013; Isermann and Münchhof, 2011; Keesman, 2011; Ljung, 1999; Tangirala, 2014; Verhaegen and Verdult, 2007). A special case is the so-called L 2–regularization where the regularization matrix is a scaled version of the identity matrix Γ = λI. I is the identity matrix and λ a scalar factor determining the effect of the regularization. For the parameter estimate, this yields θˆ = (︁ ΦT Φ+λ2 I )︁−1 ΦT y. (4.066) Regularization can not only be used to solve ill-conditioned problems, but also to exert some control over bias and variance of the estimates of any model. Con- trolling bias and variance is most desirable in SI as it can prevent overfitting by reducing variance (Isermann and Münchhof, 2011). In many cases, one can only be minimized at the cost of the other and thus, regularization allows influencing on the trade-off between bias and variance. This is often denoted as constrained least squares (CLS). 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Related Nonlinear Methods The least squares methods, as mentioned above, solve estimation problems that are linear in the parameters θ. However, there are many situations in which the minimization problem is not linear and a nonlinear least squares (NLS) method is needed. Several methods exist to solve nonlinear optimization, and many are related to the least squares approach applying it iteratively. The pseudo-linear regression method calculates new values for ϕ(k,θ) at each iteration using the least squares method and the parameters evaluated in the previous iteration. Similarly, the Gauss–Newton method uses the OLS method on the residuals to improve an initial guess of the parameters iteratively. For the Gauß–Newton method, the residual of the i th iteration is given by ϵi = y − yˆ (︂ θ(i ) )︂ (4.067) where the estimated output yˆ (︁ θ(i ))︁ depends on the parameters evaluated in the i th iteration. As for the OLS method, the goal of the Gauß–Newton method is to find a minimum where the derivative of the objective function with respect to the coefficients is zero. Instead of introducing the objective function V, like in Equa- tion (4.056), it is more convenient to use the derivatives of the estimated output evaluated by Ψ(θ) = ∂ϵ(θ) ∂θ = [︃ ∂ϵ ∂θ1. ]︃T (4.068) as defined in Equation (4.053). These are called pseudo-regressors in the nonlinear framework. In matrix form for all samples, Ψ is the Jacobian matrix of yˆ(θ). The iteration rule is then similar to the OLS method: θ(i +1) = θ(i ) + (︂ Ψ(θ(i ))T Ψ(θ(i )) )︂−1 Ψ(θ(i ))T ϵi. (4.069) The relation of the NLS method to the OLS method becomes even more apparent in the fact that if the estimator is linear, then Ψ→ Φ (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). The Levenberg–Marquardt method (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) can be seen as an improved version of the Gauß–Newton algorithm. It uses a trust region approach, similar to regularization, to enhance stability and convergence. Moreover, efficient implementations involving QR -factorization are known for the Gauß–Newton and Levenberg–Marquardt methods. The mentioned NLS methods need initial values for the search algorithm. These initial values are crucial as NLS algorithms are prone to become “trapped” in a local minimum instead of finding the true global minimum. Suitable initial values can be found, e.g. by using the OLS method. 4.04 System Identification Alternative methods for nonlinear minimization are so called derivative free op- timization algorithms, e.g. the Nelder–Mead simplex-reflection method (downhill simplex algorithm) (Nocedal and Wright, 2006; Isermann and Münchhof, 2011) or genetic algorithms Isermann and Münchhof. 4.04.03 Influence of Disturbances As discussed in Section 4.01.05, disturbances have an influence on the parameter es- timation. This influence can be quantified by the mean squared error (MSE). The MSE consists of two contributing factors: bias and variance, which can be estimated (Tangirala, 2014, p. 307, 322). Bias A good estimator should provide accurate estimates. Without infinitely long time series, this is only possible, if averaging over all realizations cancels out the error (Tangirala, 2014). If this is not the case, the estimate is biased. Bias is formally de- fined as ∆θˆ = E[θˆ ] −θ0 (4.070) where θ0 is the true values of the parameters and E[] denotes the expected value. Good estimators yield unbiased estimates or at least asymptotically unbiased esti- mates given by lim N →∞ ∆θˆ = 0. (4.071) An estimate for the bias of the OLS method is given by (Keesman, 2011) ∆θˆ = E [︂(︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1 ΦT e ]︂. (4.072) With the OLS method, only one minimum—the global minimum—exists and is therefore found unambiguously. However, if the residuals are not GWN, the OLS procedure will never yield the true values of θ (Ljung, 1999). Hence, the regression model is biased whenever the equation error is colored (Tangirala, 2014). Variance Besides accuracy, the ability to estimate the “true” value, precision is important. Precision manifests in estimates with low variance. The variance of the parameter estimates is formally defined as σ2 θˆ = E [︁ (θˆ −E [︁ θˆ ]︁ )2]︁. (4.073) 4 Linear Dynamic Systems In the scope of the OLS method, the variance is given by Cov(θˆ ) = E [︂(︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1 ΦT Cov(e)Φ (︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1]︂. (4.074) Assuming the residuals are GWN, the covariance matrix Sˆ is estimated using the Gramian matrix of the regressor matrix: Sˆ = Cov(θˆ ) = σˆ 2 ϵ (︁ ΦT Φ )︁−1 (4.075) The variance of the residuals σˆ 2 ϵ is estimated by σ2 ϵ = 1 N −1 N∑︂ n=1 ε2(n). (4.076) Confidence intervals for the identified coefficients can thus be given as θˆi −Cα √︂ Sˆi i ≤ θi,0 ≤ θˆi +Cα √︂ Sˆi i (4.077) where Sˆi i is the i th diagonal of Sˆ and Cα is the α-level of the normal distribution for the desired confidence level, e.g. Cα = 2.058 for 99% confidence intervals (Tangirala, 2014, p. 342). Bootstrapping Another method to estimate the uncertainty in the coefficient estimates (vari- ance) is bootstrapping (Söderström and Stoica, 1989; Ljung, 1999; Pintelon and Schoukens, 2012; Tangirala, 2014). A new set of N regressors is drawn from the set {ϕ} in random order “with replacement”. The new regressors form a regressor matrix Φ(i ), which is used to calculate the estimate for the coefficients θ(i ). From all coefficient samples, mean and covariance matrix can be computed using estimates for the sample mean and the sample covariance. Mean Square Error The MSE is defined as MSE (︁ θˆ )︁ = E[∥θˆ −θ0∥2 2] (4.078) where θ0 is the true value of the estimator. In terms of bias and variance, this is expressed as (Tangirala, 2014) MSE (︁ θˆ )︁ = tr (︁ Sˆθˆ )︁ +∥∆θˆ ∥2 2 (4.079) 4.04 System Identification where tr (︁ Sˆθˆ )︁ denotes the trace of the covariance matrix. The MSE is estimated calculating the sample average of the residuals MSEˆ = 1 N −1 N∑︂ n=1 ε(n). (4.080) For a consistent estimator, MSE (︁ θˆ )︁ → 0 for N → ∞. Efficient Estimators The most efficient estimator is the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE). This implies that the estimate is unbiased and the variance is at the lowest theoreti- cal bound (Cramer–Rao lower bound) (Tangirala, 2014, p. 332). An MVUE may not exist, and hence the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is sought. The BLUE is equal to the MVUE when the observations y are governed by a linear model, and the noise e is GWN. This is known as the Gauss-Markov theorem (Tangirala, 2014, p. 332). The MVUE or BLUE are unbiased, but can still have high variance. The minimum mean square error estimator (MMSE) tries to achieve the best trade-off between bias and variance leading to the smallest MSE. In this case, the variance can be smaller than the Cramer–Rao lower bound at the cost of bias. The MMSE is achieved, e.g. by using regularization techniques. 4.04.04 Identification of Discrete Time Models For discrete time models, it is assumed that the outputy[k] can be constructed from the deterministic signal x[k] and the stochastic noise v[k] as in y[k] = x[k] +v[k]. (4.081) The one-step ahead predictor (in this case the predictor evaluated from all inputs until the kth instant and measurements evaluated until the ( k − 1)-th instant) is given by yˆ[k|k −1] = xˆ[k] +vˆ [k] (4.082) where xˆ[k] stands for the deterministic model and vˆ [k] for the noise model. Coefficients for a discrete time input-output model of a priori defined structure and model orders as in Equation (4.028) can be found by minimizing the one-step ahead prediction errors given by ε[k|k −1] = y[k] − yˆ[k|k −1]. (4.083) 4 Linear Dynamic Systems The one–step ahead prediction error is the difference between known output y and predicted output yˆ at every instantk. These errors are also referred to as innovations Tangirala. For a more general description, the prediction error sequence may be filtered by a stable linear filter L(q): εF (k,θ) = L(q)ε(k,θ). (4.084) This type of estimation method is called prediction error method (PEM). For the minimization procedure, the cost function V (θ) = N −1∑︂ k=0 ε2 F (k,θ) (4.085) is defined and minimized. Choosing the sum of the squared errors as the cost func- tion corresponds to a minimization problem denoted by argmin θ N −1∑︂ k=0 ε2 F (k,θ). (4.086) This is called the quadratic-criteria PEM (PEM-QC). The general discrete time model is given in Equation (4.027) as y[k] =G(q)u[k] +H(q)e[k]. (4.087) This yields the one-step ahead predictor yˆ[k|k −1] = H−1(q)G(q)u[k] +(1 −H−1)y[k]. (4.088) Numerous ways to parametrize G and H exist (Tangirala, 2014). The most widely used method is shown in Section 4.03.02. The theoretical one-step ahead prediction error is the white-noise sequence (Tangirala, 2014). Models with Linear Estimators The autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model is a model structure often used because of its simplicity in estimating the coefficients. It is given by A(q)y[k] = B(q)u[k] +e[k]. (4.089) This model is of equation error type as the error enters the equation rather than the output.2 The one-step ahead prediction error is written by ε[k|k −1] = A(q)y[k] −B(q)u[k]. (4.090) 2 As opposed to the output error models. 4.04 System Identification The innovations are linear in the coefficients A(q) and B(q). Therefore, the coeffi- cient estimation is linear, and the OLS method (or WLS/CLS method respectively) can be used. This leads to one of the main advantages of this method: Only a global minimum exists which is found unambiguously by the estimation procedure (Ljung, 1999). The major drawback, however, is that the model inherently assumes that the noise is predictable with a linear predictor. Thus, the least squares proce- dure will not converge to the true values of the coefficients, if the equation error vˆ [k] = 1/A(q)v[k] is not GWN. In this case, the estimation yields a biased estimate (Ljung, 1999). The finite impulse response (FIR) model is written as y[k] = B(q)u[k] +e[k]. (4.091) It is equal to the ARX model with A = 1 and thus also has a linear estimator. The FIR model is often referred to as non-parametric model (Tangirala, 2014) because the impulse response is equal to the identified coefficients and not parameterized via a denominator polynomial. It has the advantage that no model order has to be chosen, but the length of the impulse response is specified directly via the num- ber of coefficients nb and the sampling time step Ts. The impulse response is zero after nb ·Ts, hence the name finite impulse response. Following Equation (4.08), FIR models are always stable. However, the pre-specified length of the impulse response is also the greatest weakness of the model. For dynamics slowly varying in time or large differences in time scales, a large number of coefficients is necessary to capture the dynamics correctly (Tangirala, 2014). In contrast to the ARX model, the equation error in the FIR model is assumed to be unpredictable, i.e. vˆ [k] = 0 and v[k] = e[k]. Deterministic model G(q) and noise model H(q) (cf. Equation (4.027)) are parametrized independently and the deter- ministic model converges to the true value (Tangirala, 2014). This property is called consistency (Tangirala, 2014). Before a parametric model (with a reasonable number of coefficients) is identified insight on the model order can be gained by identifying a high order FIR model. This type of model also benefits greatly from regularization, i.e. it is advantageous to use the CLS approach for coefficient estimation (Keesman, 2011). Output-Error Model An output-error (OE) model is achieved when only the deterministic part of the general discrete time input-output structure (Equation (4.028)) is sought. All other 4 Linear Dynamic Systems B(q) F (q) u(t) x(t) y(t) e(t) Figure 4.07: Block Diagram of the Output-Error Model. coefficients are unity (A =C = D = 1) and hence not identified. This corresponds to an error term that is added to the output of the system.3 The model takes the form y[k] = B(q) F (q) u[k] +e[k]. (4.092) Figure 4.07 sketches a block diagram of an OE model. If the model structure is re-written in equation-error form given by F (q)y[k] = B(q)u[k] +v[k], (4.093) it can be shown that a least squares estimate would be biased due tov[k] = F (q)e[k]. Hence, a nonlinear parameter estimation method is necessary. Using the PEM framework for the OE model, the one-step ahead prediction error can be written as ε[k|k −1] = y[k] − B(q) F (q) u[k]. (4.094) Introducing instrumental variables equal to the predicted (noise free) outputs ξ[k] = yˆ[k] = B(q)/F (q)u[k], the prediction equation for a single instant k in time is given by yˆ[k|θ] = −f 1ξ[k −1] − f 2ξ[k −2] −···− fna ξ[k −na] +b 0 u[k] +b 1 u[k −1] +···+ bnb u[k −nb]. (4.095) In short, this is denoted as yˆ[k|θ] = ϕ(k,θ)θ (4.096) where the regression vector is ϕ = [︁ −ξ[k −1,θ] −ξ[k −2,θ] ··· − ξ[k −n f,θ] u[k] u[k −1]··· u[k −nb +1] ]︁ (4.097) 3 This is in contrast to the equation error models where the error term is included in the equation like in an ARX model. 4.04 System Identification and the vector of parameters θT = [f 1, f 2, fn f,b 0,b 1,bnb −1]. Both vectors have the length nb +n f. The OE model can also be seen from a pre-filtering viewpoint. If input and output are filtered with a linear filter that is the inverse of the denominator polynomial F (q), i.e. with y F [k] = 1/F (q)y[k] and u F [k] = 1/F (q)u[k], Equation (4.092) reads F (q)y F [k] = B(q)u F [k] +e[k]. (4.098) This is equivalent to the ARX model structure. The coefficients of the polynomials {b} and { f } are found during identification by nonlinear regression. Three different algorithms arise from the descriptions given above and may be used to estimate the parameters. A linear least squares method is applied to achieve a biased estimate of the parameters. The predicted output yˆ[k] and thus the instrumental variables ξ[k] are computed. This procedure is repeated until the change in θˆ is negligible. However, convergence cannot be guaranteed (Ljung, 1999; Söderström and Stoica, 1989). This method is known as pseudo-linear regression (Tangirala, 2014). The al- gorithm by Steiglitz and Mc Bride uses pre-filtering to iteratively compute a least squares estimate of the coefficients on input-output time series. The filter, which is the inverse of the denominator polynomial, is evaluated iteratively until convergence. Ultimately, the NLS method, e.g. the Gauß-Newton algorithm, can be used. The gradient necessary for the NLS method can be computed using ψ[k] = 1 F (q)φ[k]. (4.099) The OE model, similar to the FIR model, is a consistent estimator. The determinis- tic part and the noise are parameterized independently and hence B(q)/F (q) con- verges to the true value. For the initialization, when ξ[k,θ] is yet unknown, an OLS approach is applied using the measured output y[k] (ARX model). The algorithms for the identification used in this thesis are implemented in the SI toolbox of MAT- LAB (The Math Works, Inc. 2016; Ljung, 2016 a,b). Box-Jenkins Model The Box-Jenkins (BJ) model is an extension of the OE model. Not only the determin- istic process is modeled, but also the (stochastic) noise. The use of this model type is indicated if the noise dynamics differ severely from the assumption of GWN, i.e. H ̸= 1. The addition of a noise model offers more flexibility but at the cost of an increase in model complexity (Tangirala, 2014, p. 601). The model is given by y[k] = B(q) F (q) u[k] + C (q) D(q)e[k]. (4.0100) The block diagram of a BJ model is depicted in Figure 4.08. The one-step ahead pre- 4 Linear Dynamic Systems B(q) F (q) u(t) x(t) y(t) v(t) C (q) D(q) e(t) Figure 4.08: Block Diagram of a Box-Jenkins Model. diction error for the BJ model is given by ε[k|k −1] = D(q) C (q) y[k] − D(q)B(q) C (q)F (q) u[k]. (4.0101) For the parameter estimation, similar procedures as for the OE model can be used. The most efficient method is applying one of the NLS algorithms. The Jacobian ma- trix, required in the NLS procedure, is evaluated by Ψ= D(q) C (q)F (q)Φ. (4.0102) The deterministic model and the stochastic model are parametrized independently as in the case of the OE model and thus converge to their true values. However, the main difference is that the model for the noise is identified and not restricted to H(q) = 1. The BJ model is the most versatile model structure at the cost of complex- ity and number of coefficients. The BJ model includes a parametrization for the noise. It is of no use to regard the noise model as a transfer function as the input, the noise input e[k], is by definition unknown. It is therefore more useful to consider the spectrum of the noise given by |H(Sr,θ)|2 (Ljung, 1999, p. 202). 4.04.05 Identification of Continuous Time Models The second method for SI that was successfully evaluated in this thesis is the identifi- cation of continuous time transfer functions from frequency domain data. Continu- ous time identification is an emerging branch in SI (Tangirala, 2014) and offers some advantages. Frequency domain data can, e.g. be acquired from linearized equations 4.04 System Identification in frequency space or by transforming time domain data, i.e. using the FFT method. Similar to the OE model in discrete time, only the deterministic part G(s) is modeled. The noise term is omitted in this case. The goal in the identification of continuous time models is the direct identification of a rational function in powers of the fre- quency parameter s as shown in Section 4.03.01. The transfer function is modeled using G(s) ≈ N (s) D(s) = nn∑︁ p=0 rp φp (s) nd∑︁ p=0 r˜p φp (s) (4.0103) where N (s) and D(s) represent numerator and denominator of the transfer function, respectively. The identification of continuous time models is based on the application of least squares methods to data acquired at discrete (but not necessarily equidistant) fre- quencies. Early methods, including Levy’ s polynomial fitting (Levy, 1959), were numerically poorly conditioned, suffered from unbalanced weighting, or were likely to produce unstable models. The Sanathanan-Koerner (SK) iteration method (Sanathanan and Koerner, 1963) overcame the weighting problem and yielded far better results. In 1998, vector fitting (VF) was introduced (Gustavsen and Semlyen, 1998, 1999). VF originally used partial fractions as basis iteratively identifying poles and residues. This pole relocation method was successfully applied in the scope of thermoacoustic by Orchini et al. Stable models can easily be enforced with this method. It was further improved by to orthonormal basis functions (OVF) (Deschrijver et al, 2007) and by including a H 2 error measure (Quad VF) (Drmaˇ c et al, 2015). The use of QR -decomposition to solve the least squares problem lead to better conditioning for all variants of this identification technique (cf. section 4.04.02). The behavior of a system is characterized by nk frequency domain data samples (sk, G 0(sk )), i.e. frequency and frequency response. If the acquired data is in time domain, G 0(sk ) can be gained by G 0(i ωk ) = FFT(y) FFT(u). (4.0104) The model parameters can be estimated using least squares techniques similar to the discrete time case. The minimization problem formulated for rational transfer function is written by argmin rp,r˜p nk∑︂ k=0 ⃓⃓⃓⃓ N (sk ) D(sk ) −G 0(sk ) ⃓⃓⃓⃓. (4.0105) This is a nonlinear problem that cannot be solved by the OLS method in a straight- forward manner. The two methods employed in this thesis, SK iterations and the VF approach are now explained in more detail. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Sanathanan-Koerner Iteration A method to solve Equation (4.0105) are SK iterations. The minimization problem is reformulated to argmin rp,r˜p nk∑︂ k=0 |D(sk )|2 |N (sk ) −D(sk )G 0(sk )|2. (4.0106) A WLS method is used to solve Equation (4.0106) iteratively. Thei th iteration is given by argmin r (i ) p,r˜(i ) p nk∑︂ k=0 ⃓⃓D(i −1)(sk ) ⃓⃓2 ⃓⃓⃓N (i )(sk ) −D(i )(sk )G 0(sk ) ⃓⃓⃓. (4.0107) The term 1/ ⃓⃓D(i −1)(sk ) ⃓⃓2 acts as the weighting which is the denominator polyno- mial evaluated in the previous iteration. The remainder ⃓⃓N (i )(sk ) −D(i )(sk )G 0(sk ) ⃓⃓2 is linear in the coefficients {rp } and {r˜p }. For the first iteration, the weighting matrix is equal to the identity matrix, i.e. no weighting is applied. This is equivalent to the approach by Levy. Note the analogy to the OE model in discrete time. A linear estimator is achieved by pre-filtering with a filter equal to the denominator polynomial. The solution procedure by Steiglitz and Mc Bride also updates the estimate for the denominator, and thus the pre-filter, iteratively. This procedure has proven to yield fairly good results, but suffers from two draw- backs: (1) The regression matrix assembled to solve the least squares problem is a so-called Vandermonde matrix that tends to be ill-conditioned. (2) It is not guar- anteed that this procedure converges to the solution of the original minimization problem (Equation (4.0105)). Vector Fitting To overcome these deficiencies, Gustavsen and Semlyen (1998, 1999) suggested to use rational basis functions φp = 1/(s − αp ) instead of monomial basis functions φp = sp. In the minimization problem Equation (4.0105), numerator and denomi- nator are replaced in a way such that no weighting is necessary. The minimization problem is written as argmin rˆp,r˜p nk∑︂ k=0 ⃓⃓N˜ (sk ) −D˜ (sk )G 0(sk ) ⃓⃓2 (4.0108) where D˜ (s) = n∑︂ p=1 r˜p s −α˜ p +1 and N˜ (s) = n∑︂ p=1 rˆp s −α˜ p +d (4.0109) 4.04 System Identification are rational functions with identical poles { α˜ p }. The weighting procedure from the SK iteration method is replaced by the relocation of poles. Starting values for the poles have to be given initially. Ultimately, the transfer function is approximated by G(s) ≈ N (s) D(s) = (︄ n∑︂ p=1 rp s −αp )︄ +d (4.0110) where {αp } and {rp } are the poles and residues of the partial fractions, respectively. The least squares problem can be solved by expanding N˜ (s) = D˜ (s)G 0(s) (4.0111) which yields (︄ n∑︂ p=1 rˆp s +α˜ p )︄ +d˜ ≈ [︄(︄ n∑︂ p=1 r˜p s +α˜ p )︄ +1 ]︄ G 0(s). (4.0112) This equation is linear in the residues {rˆp } and {r˜p } as well as in the direct term d˜. It is solved using the least squares approach. Similar to Equation (4.051), the “output” in this case is the estimated transfer function given by G(sk ) = ϕ(k)θ (4.0113) with the vector of regressors ϕ(k) = [︃ 1 sk −α˜ 1 sk −α˜ 2 ··· 1 sk −α˜ n 1 −G 0(sk ) sk −α˜ 1 −G 0(sk ) sk −α˜ 2 ··· −G 0(sk ) sk −α˜ n ]︃ (4.0114) and the coefficient vector θ = [︁ rˆ1 rˆ2 ··· rˆn d˜ r˜1 r˜2 ··· r˜n ]︁T. Reformulating G(k)(s) = N˜ (k)(s) D˜ (k)(s) = d˜ + n∑︁ p=1 (︂ rˆ(k) p /︂ s −α˜ (k) p )︂ 1 + n∑︁ p=1 (︂ r˜(k) p /︂ s −α˜ (k) p )︂ (4.0115) in terms of zeros and poles yields G(s) = n∏︁ p=1 (s −βp ) /︄ n∏︁ p=1 (s −α˜ p ) n∏︁ p=1 (s −β˜ p ) /︄ n∏︁ p=1 (s −α˜ p ) = n∏︁ p=1 (s −βp ) n∏︁ p=1 (s −β˜ p ). (4.0116) 4 Linear Dynamic Systems This reveals that the zeros of D˜ (s) are the poles of G(s). The new poles for every iteration of this procedure can be calculated from {α˜ p } = {β˜ p } = eig (︁ A −b ·c T )︁ (4.0117) with matrix A including the poles { α˜ p } of the previous iteration as diagonal, a col- umn vector of ones b and the residues {r˜p } in vector c T. This uses the fact that the eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. If a stable model is desired, this can be enforced by flipping unstable poles, i.e. Re (︁ {α˜ p } )︁ > 0 into the left half plane α˜ p = −α˜ p. The pole relocation procedure is repeated until D˜ (s) approaches 1. The poles calculated in the final iteration with D˜ (s) = 1 are the poles of the identified transfer function { αp } = {α˜ p }. In the second stage, the residues {rp } of the transfer function estimate are calculated. This is achieved by solving Equation (4.0110) in a least squares sense using the final poles from the first step. The procedure implemented in MATLAB R 2016 b (The Math Works, Inc. 2016; Ljung, 2016 a,b) uses the SK iteration method in the first iteration for an initial guess for the poles. All successive iterations use the Ouad VF scheme by Drmaˇ c et al with orthonormal basis functions to acquire an accurate model and to improve the con- ditioning of the matrix. Theoretically, it is also possible to use an NLS algorithm to solve Equation (4.0105) with PEM-QC. This is numerically inferior to the VF approach (Deschrijver and Dhaene, 2006), but can be used to refine the solution acquired with VF. This approach is also implemented in MATLAB R 2016 b (The Math Works, Inc. 2016). 4.05 Model Validation There are several tests that can be performed to assess the quality of an identified model. Least Squares Fit The goal in SI is to find the estimate with the least MSE (cf. Section 4.04.03). The MSE is evaluated using MSE = 1 N N −1∑︂ k=0 (y − yˆ)2 = 1 N −1∥y − yˆ∥2 2. (4.0118) A small MSE is an indicator for a good model. However, it is complicated to compare the MSE evaluated from different models. 4.05 Model Validation A suitable ramification is to normalize the MSE with using the MSE a constant model estimated with the sample mean produces. Using the square root of the MSE gives a greater sensitivity to small deviations, i.e. small errors appear amplified. This results in the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE). To get a fit value with higher values signifying a better fit the NRMSE is subtracted from unity. The NRMSE-fit between output y and estimated output yˆ is evaluated by Φ = 1 − ∥y − yˆ∥2 ∥y − y∥2. (4.0119) NRMSE-fit values are usually given in per cent. 100% signify a perfect fit and nega- tive values would indicate that a constant mean valuey is actually a better predictor than the estimated dynamic model. Parameter Variance A covariance matrix for the parameters θ is computed during the identification process. The identified parameters should have small variances, i.e. the confidence intervals of a parameter should be narrow. This is given by Cα √︂ Sˆi i! ≪ θˆi (4.0120) where Cα is a suitable constant for the α-level, e.g. Cα = 2.058 for a 99 % confidence interval. All parameters should be significantly different from zero. Models not ful- filling this requirement are discarded as this is a sign of an unsuitable model order. Histogram of the Residuals The estimation procedure does not give an exact solution but reduces the prediction error ε. These prediction errors or residuals can be used as an indicator of model quality. The histogram, which is a graphical representation of the distribution of the residuals, is inspected visually. Many models assume the residuals to be GWN, which can be confirmed qualitatively in this manner. Moreover, neither the mean nor the maximum value of the residual vector should be too large. Whiteness For models with linear estimators, like the ARX model, the residuals should be GWN. Otherwise, the estimates will be biased. The test forwhiteness is, therefore, a test for the noise model (Ljung, 1999; Keesman, 2011; Tangirala, 2014). In the case of the BJ model, residuals with the properties of white noise indicate a good noise model. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems For the OE model, it is not required to achieve white noise as it will still converge to the true model values. Whiteness is tested by computing the auto-correlation of the residuals given by Rεε[l] = ∞∑︂ k=−∞ ε[k]ε∗[k +l] (4.0121) where ε∗ is the complex conjugate of ε. Using the zeroth lag coefficient to standard- ize, the scales auto-correlation reads R˜ εε[l] = Rεε[l] Rεε. (4.0122) The test is passed, if all coefficients of the auto-correlation (except for the first coef- ficient which is unity by design) are R˜ εε < 1/ ⎷ N, i.e. not significantly different from zero. Independence Another criterion is the independence of residuals and input vector (Tangirala, 2014, p. 425). Independent residuals prove that no more information on the system re- sponse to the excitation signal is included in the residuals, i.e. the identification process was able to extract all information possible from the input. Independence of residuals and inputs is assessed computing the cross-correlation function between the two time series given by Rεu[l] = ∞∑︂ k=−∞ ε[k]u∗[k +l]. (4.0123) Standardization is achieved by calculating R˜ εu[l] = Rεu[l] ∥ε∥2 ·∥u∥2. (4.0124) A significance test is used to prove the insignificance of the cross-correlation coeffi- cients in the range between l = ±25 lags. The cross-correlation coefficients are not significantly different from zero, if ⃓⃓R˜ εu[l] ⃓⃓ ≤ √︃ P 1 N Cα (4.0125) where P 1 = ∞∑︂ n=−∞ R˜ εε[l] ·R˜ uu [l] (4.0126) and Cα is the α-level for the desired confidence level. 4.05 Model Validation Scatter Plot of Residuals and Output The time series of the residuals and outputs are plotted in a single graph. The ab- scissa and the ordinate show the output values and residuals, respectively. Each instant in time is represented by a single point in the plot forming a point cloud. The cloud is inspected visually for indicators concerning the properties of the data. The cloud is expected to be of elliptical shape with both principal axes aligned with the coordinate axes. Any deviation from this shape points towards two deficits of the model: (1) The model may not be able to capture the complete dynamics. In this case, a change of model order or type can be used as a remedy. (2) The system displays a non-negligible nonlinearity that calls for a nonlinear modeling approach (Bühner and Ziegler, 2009). Cross-Validation As a final performance check, a cross-validation test is carried out. The validation set, ”fresh“ data not used to develop the model parameters, serves as a data basis. The cross-validation fit is a very strong indicator of the ability of the model to repre- sent the dynamics of the true system. Testing to a new dataset also gives information on the model’ s tendency to over-fit the data. In this case, the cross-validation fit would be poor although the other tests have indicated high model quality. The cross- validation fit is given as NRMSE-fit (cf. Equation (4.0119)). Pole-Zero Cancellation Finding the right model order is an important task in SI. Insufficient model orders yield poor predictions because the dynamics are not captured sufficiently. On the other hand, too large model orders lead to over-fitting, resulting in bad predictions as well, and computational efficiency suffers. To some extent, the model order also depends on the purpose of the model and whether accuracy (sophistication) or simplicity (feasibility) is valued more (Ljung, 1999). Except for the cross-validation, which is a test for over-fitting, none of the above can give information on the correct model order. A way to approach this is to check the parameters and their covariances in the form of poles and zeros (e.g. Equa- tion (4.025)) for a continuous time transfer function). Surplus poles and zeros will be found to have very similar values on the real and imaginary axis. The result is that they cancel each other to reproduce the system dynamics and may therefore not be necessary. If a pole lies within the confidence region of a zero or vice versa, the model order can probably be reduced. 4 Linear Dynamic Systems Validation with A Priori Knowledge If only little of a system is known, model validation relies completely on the acquired data. However, if there is additional information available, this information can be used and interpreted with regard to the model quality. One possibility is to assess the behavior of a model in its limits. A good model has to be able to capture the low- frequency limit Sr → 0, which can in some cases be inferred from a quasi-steady state. The behavior in the limit of high frequencies may be given due to simplified calculations from first principles. Smoothness or the number and location of peaks in the frequency response may also be explained qualitatively from prior consider- ations. An example of this validation technique is the stability of a system, i.e. the behavior of the impulse response for t → ∞. If a steady state exists, the impulse response has to assume and hold zero after a certain time (BIBO stability, cf. Sec- tion 4.01.02). 4.06 Dynamics of Heat Transfer and Skin Friction In the scope of this thesis, linear models are developed representing the relationship between velocity fluctuations in the flow and heat transfer as well as skin friction. The systems are nonlinear by nature, but can be cast into the linear framework by making use of the perturbation approach (cf. Section 2.04.01). Linearization is achieved by removing the mean value of the respective quantity written as Nu′(t) = Nu(t) −Nu and c′ f (t) = c f (t) −c f. (4.0127) The fluctuations are scaled with the mean and hence input and outputs are given by u Re(t) = Re′(t) Re, y Nu(t) = Nu′(t) Nu, and yc f (t) = c′ f (t) c f. (4.0128) The identified transfer functions for heat transfer and skin friction are therefore related to Nußelt number Nu and friction coefficient c f by GNu = Nu′/Nu Re′/Re and Gc f = c′ f /c f Re′/Re. (4.0129) This is equal to Equation (2.0100). The full quantities can be recovered by Nu = Nu (︃ 1 +GNu Re′ Re )︃ and c f = c f (︃ 1 +Gc f Re′ Re )︃. (4.0130) 5 Data Generation With the computational resources available today, it is possible to determine the flow around a cylinder by solving the full (incompressible) Navier–Stokes equations numerically without the assumptions which the boundary layer equations or Os- een’ s method rely on. This chapter deals with the methods used in this thesis to generate the data to assess the dynamic behavior of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. All methods are based on the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.063)–(2.065)). The use of the incompressible formulation is justified for three important applications in Chapter 9. There, also the compatibility of incompressible fluid dynamics with the inher- ently compressible effect of thermoacoustics is discussed. In Section 5.01, the basic simulation setup is presented. It is based on the laminar flow simulations detailed in Section 5.02 for 0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40 and for the laminar vortex shedding regime, i.e. Re 0 = 120 and Re 0 = 240. In Section 5.03, the extensions and modifications necessary to simulate flow at Re 0 = 3900 as an exemplary condition for subcritical flow are reported. A considerably different method to acquire frequency domain data is pre- sented in Section 5.04. A perturbation is introduced in the Navier–Stokes equations. They are linearized around a steady state solution and transformed to the frequency domain (LNSE approach). Figure 5.01 gives an overview over different approaches to simulate a cylinder in pulsating crossflow and to determine the transfer function. The work shown here was previously published in parts in Witte and Polifke (2017 a). 5.01 Basic Setup The basic setup incorporates considerations concerning the boundary conditions, the computational domain, and the two-dimensional mesh which is in turn modi- fied for further investigations like the Large Eddy Simulation (LES). A thorough grid independence study was carried out to investigate the spatial discretization with respect to steady-state and pulsating flow. 5.01.01 Boundary Conditions Solving the Navier–Stokes equations is essentially the numerical integration over a given domain. The boundary conditions are necessary to evaluate the integration 5 Data Generation basic grid 2 D log-polar 2 D mesh LES mesh LNSE step input broadband broadband OE model BJ model frequency step transfer function response response mesh input input 0.01 < Re 0 < 40 0.01 < Re 0 < 240 Re 0 = 3900 Figure 5.01: Overview of Different Approaches to Determine the Transfer Function. The gray area marks steps of the SI procedure detailed in Chapter 6. constants, i.e. the integrals become definite integrals. The flow enters the domain at the inlet where an inlet velocity u∞(t) = u∞,0 +u′ ∞(t) is prescribed. This velocity value consists of a mean flow component u∞,0 and a time dependent fluctuation u′ ∞(t) (cf. Equation (2.085)). The latter is either a sudden increase in velocity by 10 % at time t = t 0, which is then held constant to yield the step response of the heat transfer (cf. Section 6.01), or a random sequence of velocity values. This provides a broadband, colored noise input signal for the SI procedure (cf. Section 6.03). The (relative) pressure at the inlet has zero normal gradient, and the inbound fluid has a constant temperature of Θ = 0. The flow passes the cylinder, represented by a no-slip wall with a constant temper- ature set to Θ = 1. At the outlet, the relative kinematic pressure (P = p/ρ) is fixed to P = 0 and Neumann type boundary conditions are applied for the velocity and the temperature. With such an outflow condition, flow variables are effectively extrapo- lated to the boundary nodes. All other boundaries, parallel to the flow, are symmetry boundaries. Close to the cylinder, actual symmetry is enforced as justified by the symmetric flow patterns expected to occur. The symmetry condition at the far field acts as a slip wall con- dition.

Figure 5.02). This domain is discretized with a block-structured, three-dimensional mesh consist- ing of hexahedrons with only one cell of unit thickness in the direction of the axis of the cylinder. At the cylinder, the cells are square with respect to the plane nor- mal to the axis of the cylinder and aligned to the curvature. Gradients aligned and normal to the surface of the cylinder are thus resolved equally. This corresponds to the nature of creeping and laminar flow. The cylindrical structure of the grid makes it possible to adjust the radial and circumferential node distribution close to the cylinder. At the same time, the near wall flow is kept aligned with the control volume 5 Data Generation Figure 5.03: Mesh Topology of Exemplary Mesh. 36 Cells along Cylinder Perimeter. The boundaries are in a distance of 50 d to the cylinder. The grids used for computations were at least four times finer. boundaries. The surface adjacent region is strongly refined towards the surface of the cylinder to properly resolve the steep gradients. Around the inner circular block, another O-type grid is fitted to achieve a smooth transition from the cylindrical cen- ter to the outer rectangular region. The remaining blocks are of H-type with regular cell spacing. The topology of the mesh is shown in Figure 5.03. Figure 5.04 depicts a detail of the mesh close to the cylinder. To achieve a high-quality grid with the least amount of skewness and a cell aspect ra- tio close to unity, square cells are enforced at the cylinder boundary. In combination with the fixed size of the H–O-transition zone, this choice determines the cell sizes throughout the domain as a function of the resolution at the cylinder. The number of cells Nc along the surface of the half cylinder is chosen as the measure of the grid resolution. The size of the surface adjacent cells in radial and circumferential direction ∆xc is therefore given by ∆xc /d = π/(2 Nc ). 5.01.03 Grid Study The insensitivity of computational results to spatial and temporal discretization was ascertained in three stages: The dependence of the solution on the domain size (1 a) and the cell size (1 b) was assessed for steady flow. In a second stage, a sinusoidal modulation of the inlet velocity with an amplitude of 5 % of the mean velocity and a frequency of Sr= 40 was imposed at the inlet. This represents a high frequency mod- ulation resulting in a very thin unsteady (acoustic) boundary layer. The impact of 5.01 Basic Setup Figure 5.04: Detail of an Exemplary Mesh. 36 Cells along Cylinder Perimeter. The mesh is designed to feature almost square cells close to the cylinder. The grids used for computations were at least four times finer. the cell size (2 a) and the time step size (2 b) on the heat transfer frequency response at this high frequency were assessed. Finally, grid independence for the complete SI process was demonstrated with a grid resolution chosen according to the results of the second stage and the next finer grid (3). A basic initial grid study was carried out by Brandl during the course of a bachelor’ s thesis, which was supervised by the author of this thesis. Domain Size and Cell Size in Steady Flow The size of the computational domain is characterized by a single length scale Ld, i.e. the minimal distance between the axis of the cylinder and the domain boundaries (cf. Figure 5.02). Steady-state simulations with increasing distance between the do- main boundaries with boundary conditions as stated above and the cylinder were conducted at a moderate mean flow Reynolds number (Re 0 = 12.071). The goal of this first stage was to evaluate the upstream and sideways displacement of fluid re- sulting from the presence of the cylinder. The inlet boundary of the computational domain was then placed at a position where such displacement was not noticeable. Similarly, the lateral domain size was chosen in such a way that the influence of the slip-wall boundaries on the flow close to the cylinder was considered insignificant, as detailed below. 5 Data Generation Ld /d Nu 0 ∆d in % 15 2.0064 1.031 20 2.0055 0.089 30 2.0047 0.049 40 2.0044 0.030 50 2.0041 0.020 100 2.0037 — Table 5.01: Results of the Steady-State Domain Size Study. Grid study (1 a), Re 0 = 12.071, CFL ≤ 1, Nc = 144, steady state Sr = 0. The effect of the domain size on the Nußelt number was tested in the range 15 ≤ Ld ≤ 100. The computed Nußelt numbers Nu 0 and the deviations from the largest domain ∆d = [Nu 0(Ld ) −Nu 0(100 d)]/Nu 0(100 d) are shown in Table 5.01. Eventually, a domain size of Ld = 50 d was chosen with a relative difference in Nußelt number to the largest domain of ∆d = 0.020 %. This choice should ensure a very small influence of domain size ∆d < 1 % at lower Reynolds numbers, where the region influenced by the presence of the cylinder is somewhat larger. The extent of the domain used in all subsequent simulations is depicted in Figure 5.02. It was confirmed that flow reversal did not occur at the outlet for any of the flow conditions considered in this study. The results of the grid independence study for steady flow are given in Table 5.02. ∆c = [︁ Nu 0(Nc ) −Nu 0,RE ]︁ /Nu 0,RE is the difference in mean Nußelt number to a solu- tion evaluated using Richardson extrapolation (RE) (Ferziger and Peri´ c, 2002) with an estimated scheme order of 2.000. A grid with Nc = 72 cells along the surface of the half cylinder, corresponding to a total of about 39×103 finite volumes, assures very small sensitivity of steady-state heat transfer ∆c < 0.01% on the grid resolution. Cell Size and Time Step Size for High-Frequency Harmonic Modulation The thickness of the unsteady Stokes boundary layer δSt = (2ν/ω)1/2 (cf. Sec- tion 3.01.02) decreases with frequency. At high frequencies, this layer is small, but it is necessary to resolve it in order to achieve a good model with quantitative accuracy for the dynamics of the unsteady flow. The Stokes layer at high frequencies is also much smaller than the steady boundary layer, which makes this a more demanding requirement than grid independence in the steady case. In order to test for grid inde- pendence in the unsteady case, a single frequency sine wave was superimposed on the inlet velocity u′ ∞(t) = ϵu∞,0 sin(ωt). The frequency ω was chosen at the upper end of the range of interest Sr = 40, the amplitude was set to ϵ = 0.005 to remain in the linear regime at all times. 5.01 Basic Setup Nc Nu 0 ∆c in % ∆xc /d ·10−3 Total number of cells 36 3.02709 0.0187 43.06 2466 72 3.02665 0.0052 21.08 9864 144 3.02652 0.0013 10.09 39 456 288 3.02649 0.0003 5.045 157 824 576 3.02648 0.00008 2.073 631 296 1152 3.02648 0.00002 1.036 2 525184 Table 5.02: Results of the Steady-State Cell Size Study.Grid study (1 b),Ld = 50, Re 0 = 40, CFL ≤ 1, steady state Sr = 0. The heat transfer frequency response GNu(Sr = 40) was evaluated at the excitation frequency using Fourier transforms of the time series and Equation (4.0104). The frequency response was scaled with respect to the mean values Re 0 and Nu 0. Any constant offset was removed. Suitable reference values to assess relative differences between results computed with different meshes were chosen. These are the theo- retical low-frequency limit (steady-state gain K ) for the amplitude and the theoreti- cal high-frequency limit for the phase. Relative differences in amplitude and phase were calculated using the reference values mentioned above by ∆|G|(Nc ) = |G(Nc )|−| G(Nc = 576)| K (5.05) ∆∠G (Nc ) = ∠G(Nc ) −∠G(2 Nc ) −π/2. (5.06) For the given mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 40, the steady-state value evalu- ated to K = 0.041. The results for the frequency response and its relative change are presented in Table 5.03. Both amplitude and phase show monotonic convergence. The amplitude value for the finest grid is slightly larger than expected from a simple extrapolation of the values at Nc = 144 and Nc = 288. This could be due to the fact that steady mean flow conditions were not fully achieved during this computationally expensive simula- tion. However, all amplitude differences were below ∆|G| < 0.05% and thus even the coarsest mesh gave good results for the transfer function amplitude at Sr = 40. The differences in phase were slightly larger, but values ∆∠G < 1 % could be achieved with Nc = 288 or finer. The Stokes layer thickness depends inversely on the mean flow Reynolds number and the Strouhal number δSt = d [2/(Re 0 Sr)]1/2. To transfer this finding to simula- tions with different Reynolds numbers, the number of surface adjacent cells within the unsteady Stokes boundary layer was kept at NSt ≈ δSt/∆xc ≥ 5. 5 Data Generation Nc |G| ∠G in ° ∆|G| in % ∆∠G in % NSt 144 0.0042 44 −79.088 0.0059 48 1.0186 3 288 0.0042 49 −80.049 0.0047 09 0.04309 6 576 0.0042 69 −80.084 — — 12 Table 5.03: Results of the Dynamic Cell Size Study.Grid study (2 a), Ld = 50, Re 0 = 40, CFLmax ≤ 0.02, Stokes layer size δSt(Re 0 = 40,Sr = 40) = 0.003536 d. For a Reynolds number Re 0 = 40, it was necessary to resolve the field close to the cylinder with Nc = 288 (158 ×103 cells in total). Considering the same range of Strouhal numbers, a resolution of Nc = 144 (39 ×103 cells in total) was sufficient for cases with Re 0 ≤ 4. Using a coarser grid for lower Re 0 is also justified by the strong low-pass behavior of the frequency response. The response at high frequencies was near zero and hence is irrelevant for most technical purposes. The time step size of the simulation was determined by the CFL number defined by CFL ≡ ∆t u ∆x ≈ φ∆t ∆V (5.07) where ∆t is the time step, u the velocity in a finite volume cell, and ∆x is a measure for the cell size. In the CFD code, the CFL number was approximated using the flux at the cell faces φ and the volume of the respective cell ∆V. The results for simu- lations at various maximum CFL numbers CFL max are given in Table 5.04. The heat transfer frequency response for a single frequency GNu(Sr = 40) was determined and differences were computed with Equation (5.05) and Equation (5.06). For all simulations throughout different meshes, ∆t was chosen to satisfy the con- dition CFL ≤ 0.02 in every cell. Refining the time step size further led to changes of ∆|GNu|,∆∠G < 1 % in gain and phase. Grid Resolution for Broadband Modulation and System Identification In the final stage (grid study 3), simulations with broadband excitation were per- formed ( u′ ∞(t) is a specifically generated signal with certain properties, cf. Sec- tion 5.02.01). The meshes used in this stage were the ones proven to be sufficiently fine to resolve high frequency fluctuations in the previous stage ( Nc = 144 for Re 0 = 0.04 and Re 0 = 4 as well as Nc = 288 for Re 0 = 40) as well as the next finer grids. Only very minor differences between the two grids were detected for each of the tested mean flow Reynolds numbers. As criterion for the agreement between the frequency responses in the whole frequency range 0 ≤ Sr ≤ 40, the NRMSE-fit (cf. Section 4.05) evaluated at 1 ×104 equidistant frequencies was chosen. The agreement between Nc = 144 and Nc = 288 was 92.00 % and 97.04 % for Re 0 = 0.04 and Re 0 = 4, respectively. 5.02 Laminar Time Domain Simulation CFLmax |G| ∠G in ° ∆|G| in % ∆∠G in % CFL 2.00 0.007583 −89.092 26.028 17.075 0.01130 1.00 0.01409 −83.035 8.0690 10.046 0.0056 80 0.05 0.01662 −76.021 1.0848 2.0525 0.0028 80 0.02 0.01732 −74.037 0.005017 0.04724 0.0011 70 0.01 0.01731 −73.094 — — 0.0005 810 Table 5.04: Results of the Dynamic Time Step Size Study.

These values were in the same range as the NRMSE-fit of the individual models to the time domain data they were trained on. As a result of the grid independence study the meshes used further featured Ld = 50 d, Nc = 288 for Re 0 > 4 and Nc = 144 for Re 0 ≤ 4, as well as CFLmax ≤ 0.02. 5.02 Laminar Time Domain Simulation This thesis endeavors to give a broad overview of the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. Nevertheless, the main focus remains the flow at low Reynolds numbers where the steady state exists and is two-dimensional and axis-symmetric. The boundary conditions and mesh used in this investigations are without modifications those explained in Section 5.01. Prior to the simulation run, an excitation signal to be imposed on the inlet was generated. 5.02.01 Excitation Signal Generation Three different types of excitation signal were used in the course of this study: (1) a step input to directly evaluate the step response of heat transfer and skin friction, (2) a sinusoidal wave input representing a single frequency, and (3) a broadband signal for the subsequent SI procedure. Type (2) was used during the grid independence study (cf. Section 5.01.03) and for a quick survey of the nonlinear behavior of the heat transfer in the presence of high amplitude oscillations (cf. Section 8.03.03). For reasons of computational efficiency, the simulations were carried out with a variable time step size determined by the CFL number (cf. Section 5.01.03). Input val- ues are supplied to the CFD solver as tabulated values of time and corresponding velocity vector in a separate file. The according boundary condition in Open FOAM is called “uniform Fixed Value”. If the table entry does not correspond to the actual time step of the simulation, a linear interpolation is performed. 5 Data Generation Step Input To assess the step response of the system, a small, sudden change in inlet velocity is forced in the simulation after reaching an initial stationary state. A weak perturba- tion (ϵ = 0.01) was imposed to assure a linear response. The sudden change is applied within one time step and simulation is continued until a new stationary state (only very small changes over time) is reached. The input signal can be expressed as Re(t) = Re 0 +Re′(t) where Re′(t) = {︄ 0 t < ts ϵRe 0 t ≥ ts. (5.08) Sine Input A sinusoidal input was used to evaluate the response of the heat transfer and the skin friction at a single frequency, i.e. Strouhal number. The signal is described by Re(t) = Re 0 (1 +ϵ sin(Srt)). (5.09) Again, ϵ denotes the amplitude of the pulsation and is set to ϵ = 0.01 to investigate the linear frequency response. This amplitude was chosen to keep well below the threshold of about ϵ ≈ 0.03 where the approximation of an LTI systems ceases to be valid in the case of the heat transfer (Heckl, 1990; Hantschk and Vortmeyer, 1999; Selimefendigil et al, 2012). A nonlinear response in heat transfer and even flow reversal could be achieved by ϵ > 1.00. Broadband Input The broadband excitation is used in simulations to create and acquire the data for the SI procedure. The broadband input in combination with SI has many advan- tages over the step input and the sine input. In contrast to the step input, which would theoretically be sufficient to describe the LTI dynamics, a broadband signal continuously excites the system and is, therefore, less prone to disturbances influ- encing the response. The frequency spectrum of the input can be predefined and hence also very high frequencies, possibly interfering with the convergence of the numerical procedure, are avoided. This is also the main advantage over the sine input. With a sine wave, it is only possible to acquire the response at a single fre- quency. The input signal is created using the non-Gaussian simulation algorithm by Mas- ters and Gurley. For the signal generation in the CFD/SI approach this algo- rithm was implemented and tested by Föller and Polifke. This routine creates 5.02 Laminar Time Domain Simulation a vector of random values from a given cumulative distribution function (CDF) and amplitude distribution. These distributions are taken from the properties of a Daubechies wavelet scaling function. Hence, this signal was termed wavelet based excitation signal. The prototype wavelet is designed with the desired features like a specific corner frequency. The time series is created with the desired overall length as fluctuations in the interval [ −1, 1]. To acquire the proper input signal for the CFD simulations, the time series was scaled, and a constant for the mean flow was added. If necessary, the time series was pre-filtered with a fifth order Butterworth filter to achieve the desired frequency spectrum. This is beneficial for CFD simulations, because the signal varies smoothly between time instances. The corner frequency chosen for this thesis corresponds to Sr≈ 60. This is high enough so that a good power spectral density of the frequency range of interest 0 ≤ Sr ≤ 40 is achieved, but the changes between successive input values are small enough to not impede the convergence of the CFD simulation. To have a sufficiently smooth input signal, a recommendation is to ensure 20 < ωs ωb < 40 (5.010) where ωs = 2π/Ts is the sampling frequency and ωb is the 3 d B bandwidth of the signal (Franklin et al, 1997, Chapter 11). It was therefore reasonable to sample the input signal with Ts = 0.0001. An advantage of the non-Gaussian simulation is that the input signal does not fol- low a Gaussian distribution, but is almost uniformly distributed. This results in a comparably high crest factor (Tangirala, 2014), which is desirable for identification experiments because the amplitude extrema are assumed more often than in the case of a random Gauss signal. 5.02.02 Computational Procedure To perform SI, time series data for the quantities of interest needed to be generated. In order to obtain these time series, a simulation over a certain period of time had to be carried out. For this simulation an algorithm that solves Equations (2.063) to (2.065) accurately for every time step was necessary. This was achieved by using the PIMPLE algorithm implemented in the Open FOAM (Open FOAM Foundation, 2014) framework. This algorithm is the combination of two well-known algorithms for transient simulations, PISO (Issa, 1986) and transient-SIMPLE (Patankar and Spald- ing, 1972; Caretto et al, 1973). It employs two so-called “correctors”, which are loops of the PISO algorithm, to compute a Laplace equation for pressure correction. Sub- sequently, new values for the momentum are calculated. In addition, for every time step, there are “outer correctors” corresponding to loops of the transient-SIMPLE 5 Data Generation algorithm. In these corrector steps, also the mass flux across the faces of the finite volumes is updated. For every time step, several outer corrections were computed until a specified initial residual of 1 ×10−6 was reached for pressure, velocity, and temperature. Usually, 10 to 50 outer correctors are necessary to achieve this min- imum tolerance. Each of these transient-SIMPLE loops triggered two PISO loops. This algorithm was computationally more expensive than each algorithm by itself (about a factor of two compared to PISO, which needed more iterations of the lin- ear equation solvers). However, the PIMPLE scheme results in stable and accurate solutions. In this application, a solution for every time step was sought that provided good results up to frequencies in the range of Sr = 40. Small time steps were necessary to achieve this. Time step size was determined by the CFL number which was fixed to CFL ≤ 0.02. Larger CFL numbers lead to an overprediction of the amplitude of GNu, although the simulation runs stable. Using only the PISO algorithm, yielded good values for |GNu| and was computa- tionally less expensive. However, the mass flux was only updated once each time step and therefore “lagged” behind. This lag leads to overpredicted values at high frequencies in GNu or necessitates much smaller time steps. Spatial gradients and divergence terms were approximated using a central differ- ence scheme (termed “linear” in Open FOAM) that is second order in space. An unbounded, second order, conservative scheme (named “corrected”) was used for Laplacian terms and surface normal gradients are calculated with explicit non- orthogonal correction (named “corrected”). As the temporal scheme, a second order approximation was chosen using three time levels calculating present values from two previous time instants. For the first time step, the implicit Euler scheme (Ferziger and Peri´ c, 2002) was used. The size of each time step was evaluated with the calculated velocities forcing the maximum CFL number to CFLmax ≤ 0.02. The maximum time between two instances was limited to ∆t = 5 ×10−3, even if the CFL number was CFL max < 0.02. This ensured a specified minimum temporal resolution for the highest frequency. The fluid properties were represented by the Prandtl number with a fixed value of Pr = 0.071 and the Reynolds number. To achieve the desired value for Re 0, given an unperturbed inlet velocity and a cylinder diameter, the kinematic viscosity ν was set accordingly. At least two seconds were simulated using the finite volume approach. This yielded more than 40×103 instances in time that were used in the identification procedure. The duration of the simulation corresponded to the unperturbed flow passing the cylinder at least 200 times. 5.02 Laminar Time Domain Simulation Axis-Symmetric Flow For mean flow Reynolds numbers below the vortex shedding threshold Re 0 ≤ 40 (cf. Section 2.01), the symmetric mesh, as described in Section 5.01, was used. Simulations were carried out for Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40. To acquire a more information and provide a more extensive investigation, additional simulations were computed at Re 0 = 0.01, Re 0 = 0.02, Re 0 = 0.05, Re 0 = 0.07, Re 0 = 1.00, Re 0 = 2.00, Re 0 = 3.00, Re 0 = 10, Re 0 = 20, and Re 0 = 40. Laminar Vortex Shedding Regime Numerical simulations at mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 120 and Re 0 = 240, where periodic vortex shedding occurs, are carried out on a two-dimensional grid featuring the full cylinder. This mesh was identical to the mesh presented in Sec- tion 5.01, but mirrored at the flow aligned axis through the center of the cylinder. At Re 0 = 240 weak three-dimensional structures are present, which cannot be repre- sented in the two-dimensional simulation. LES simulations at this Reynolds num- bers showed that those three-dimensional structures have a negligible effect on Nußelt numbers and friction coefficient. 5.02.03 Data Acquisition To evaluate the dynamic response of the heat transfer rate and skin friction (con- sidered as the “responses” or “outputs”) to free-stream velocity fluctuations (the “signal” or “input”), CFD data was extracted at each time step for subsequent post- processing. As the flow field is considered incompressible, a perturbation in overall mass flow rate imposed at the inlet boundary propagates without delay throughout the domain. Hence, a time lag due to finite propagation speed did not have to be taken into account. A cross-sectional area average of axial velocity u(t) is acquired at a monitor plane 9 d upstream of the cylinder, where the fluid is not influenced noticeably by the presence of the cylinder (cf. Figure 5.02). In order to get a dimensionless value, the velocity is scaled with the cylinder diameter and the kinematic viscosity to form an (unsteady) Reynolds number. Additionally, time is non-dimensionalized according to Section 2.02.03 using cylinder diameter and unperturbed free-stream velocity. Temperature gradients and shear stresses were obtained as a surface average over four sub-domains “1” to “4”, respectively, each representing a 45° sector of the sur- face of the half cylinder (cf. Figure 5.02). The sub-domains were chosen equally dis- tributed, similar to Föller et al. Different sectors coarsely stand for different flow regimes without regard for changes in flow patterns with mean flow Reynolds 5 Data Generation number Re 0. In sector 1, stagnation point flow, also examined by Lighthill, is dominant. Sectors 2 and sector 3 might be considered more similar to flat plate flow conditions, featuring a favorable and an adverse pressure gradient in steady state, respectively. Sector 4 contains the rear stagnation point and, at higher Reynolds numbers, the recirculation region. The gradients were stored for every time step during the computation and Equation (2.021) is used to calculate the Nußelt number. The sector-wise integration over the heat flux resolved circumferential variations of the heat transfer dynamics in a rudimentary manner. In particular, it will be shown below that sector 4, located on the lee side of the cylinder, exhibits a behavior that is qualitatively different from the upstream sectors. It would have been possible, of course, to use more sectors and thus analyze the circumferential variation of heat transfer dynamics in more detail. However, with four sectors, a good compromise between the level of detail and ease of presentation is achieved. The sum of the Nußelt number and the friction coefficient in the four sectors yields a measure for the overall heat transfer rate and shear stress, respectively. 5.03 Large Eddy Simulation For laminar flow, no modeling of turbulence is necessary, and the simulations are inherently direct numerical simulations (DNS). If the flow becomes turbulent, it would be necessary to resolve even the smallest length and time scales to perform DNS (cf. Section 2.01.03), i.e. the cell size and the time step size have to be of the order of the smallest turbulent length scales and time scales. The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach can be used for turbulent flow instead. The smallest turbulent scales are universal to some extend and can hence be modeled. The majority of the energy, contained mostly in the larger scales, is still resolved. The advantage of LES is the vast reduction of computational cost. The investigation in the subcritical regime was limited to only one mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 3900 in this thesis. It is, therefore, to be understood as proof of concept rather than a comprehensive quantitative survey of the dynamic behavior as it was carried out in the case of lam- inar flow. The work shown here was previously published in Witte et al (2016 a,b). Subcritical flow across a cylinder was studied quite extensively in the past. Vidya et al performed DNS at Re = 2000 and Liang and Papadakis investi- gated the case of Re = 2580 experimentally and with LES, also in the presence of a single sinusoidal frequency excitation. A mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 3900 is suitable for this investigation be- cause numerous results from experiments (Meyer et al, 2010), LES (Kravchenko and Moin, 2000; Franke and Frank, 2002) and DNS (Lehmkuhl et al, 2011) are available. 5.03 Large Eddy Simulation Domain size Cylinder position from the inlet N c d 30 d ×20 d ×πd 10 d 2.096 ×106 1.0066 ±0.0105 45 d ×30 d ×πd 15 d 3.072 ×106 1.0048 ±0.0093 60 d ×40 d ×πd 20 d 4.079 ×106 1.0065 ±0.0110 Table 5.05: Results of the Steady-State Domain Size Study (LES Case). Re 0 = 3900, CFLmax ≤ 0.05, Nc = 108. Moreover, Lysenko et al used the Open FOAM framework to conduct LES simulations with the same turbulence modeling as used in this thesis. 5.03.01 Computational Domain and Grid The domain and the mesh were deduced from the basic mesh (cf. Section 5.01) and adjusted to the requirements for LES. Turbulent flow structures are three- dimensional by nature, and hence the mesh is extended in the direction of the cylin- der axis. Further adjustments include discretization in the axial direction, proper spatial resolution, and turbulence handling. Domain The computational domain was chosen smaller than in the laminar case (cf. Sec- tion 5.01). The boundary layer thickness, i.e. the part of the flow field strongly influ- enced by the cylinder, scales with Re −1/2. A smaller domain is hence justified by a smaller boundary layer. The direction along the axis of the cylinder is resolved in the domain spanning πd (Franke and Frank, 2002; Lysenko et al, 2012). Table 5.05 shows the domain size study for the LES case. The tested domains span 10 d, 15 d, and 20 d in the directions perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. In the direction of the outlet border, twice this value was chosen, respectively. The drag coefficient cd (cf. Section 2.01.02) was chosen as an integral value to compare and test for convergence. Due to fluctuations in the flow, attributed to turbulence and vortex shedding, the value of c f is fluctuating even with steady, uniform inflow. To account for this fact, also the 95 % confidence interval is reported in Table 5.05. Mesh The topology of the three-dimensional mesh for LES was very similar to the two- dimensional mesh for the laminar simulations shown in Figure 5.02. It was adapted 5 Data Generation Nc N c d ∆c in % ∆xc /d|φ ·10−3 ∆xc /d|r ·10−3 NSt 72 1.011 ×106 1.01164 13.08 21.08 3.063 0.0987 108 3.072 ×106 1.00286 4.080 16.04 2.073 1.031 144 8.070 ×106 0.09963 1.050 10.09 1.082 1.097 180 16.06 ×106 0.09815 — 9.054 1.059 2.025 Table 5.06: Results of the Cell Size Study (LES Case). 45 d × 30 d × πd, Re 0 = 3900, CFLmax ≤ 0.05, Stokes layer size δSt(Re 0 = 3900,Sr = 40) = 0.0003581 d. to the smaller domain size, and the spanwise direction was discretized. Three refine- ment steps in coaxial cylindrical regions with decreasing radius around the cylinder ensured that cells were refined in the direction of the cylinder axis. This yielded a total of 216 cells at the surface of the cylinder in the spanwise direction. Additionally, the grid close to the cylinder experienced a grading in radial direction so that the cells formed layers around the cylinder. The non-dimensional wall distance was y+ ≈ 1 for the innermost cell, and the aspect ratio was ∼ 6. The results of the cell size study are given in Table 5.06. The difference in drag coefficient between the eval- uated grid and the finest gird is quantified by ∆c = [cd −cd (Nc = 180)]/cd (Nc = 180). Moreover, the extent of the wall adjacent cells in circumferential direction ( φ) and radial direction ( r ) are reported. Using the latter values, an estimate can be given how many cells NSt discretized the unsteady Stokes boundary layer. The mesh chosen to conduct this study featured a domain size of 45 d ×30 d ×πd, i.e. the medium sized domain in Table 5.05. Although all three meshes show very similar values for cd (all within the confidence intervals), this grid produced the smallest confidence interval and presented a good trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. The circumference of the full cylinder was discretized using 2 Nc = 216 cells. The same number of cells was used to discretize the spanwise direction. This lead to a total of 3.072 ×106 cells. A detail of the mesh close to the cylinder is shown in Figure 5.05. The drag coefficient of the cylinder for the mesh used in this thesis (cd = 1.0029) was about 5 % higher than the drag coefficient simulated with the finest mesh (cd = 0.098) and also 5 % higher than values reported in experiments (cd = 0.098) (Norberg, 1994; Meyer et al, 2010). This corresponded to one standard deviation of the fluctuating quantity. Gradual refinement of the grid provided a continuous decrease in the drag coefficient towards the value of the finest mesh. The length of the recirculation zone and the vortex shedding frequency were within the range of experimental results reported in literature (Lr = 1.019 −1.033 d; f = 0.021 −0.022 u 0,∞/d) (Meyer et al, 2010). Although the comparatively high Reynolds number leads to a very small Stokes layer at high frequencies, at least one cell was within a distance δSt to the cylinder. 5.03 Large Eddy Simulation Figure 5.05: Topology of LES Mesh in Spanwise Direction. Cut through the y = 0- plane. The full spanwise extent is shown. Boundary Conditions The boundary conditions were chosen in the same way as in the two-dimensional laminar cases. Additionally, the boundaries in spanwise direction were specified as periodic boundaries. Flow leaving the domain on one of these boundaries reenters the domain at the other boundary to emulate an infinitesimally long cylinder. Two additional flow variables, the subgrid scale (SGS) turbulent kinetic energy k SGS and the SGS viscosity νSGS, had to be accounted for. It was assumed that the flow at the inlet was laminar. Hence, the free-stream turbu- lence was not a parameter in this investigation. The SGS turbulent kinetic energy k SGS was therefore set to a small value at the inlet. At the outlet, a zero gradient boundary condition was applied. For the boundary conditions of the SGS variables at the surface, three approaches were considered. The first strategy was to apply wall models fork SGS and νSGS. How- ever, the mesh close to the surface of the cylinder was fine enough to resolve the gradients at the wall ( y+ ≈ 1) and hence a wall model for the SGS turbulent kinetic energy, recommended for y+ > 30 is not applicable. In the second approach, the variables were chosen to k SGS = 0 and νSGS = 0 at the surface. These conditions are very strict and theoretically only applicable in the limit of fully resolved turbulence (DNS). The boundary conditions applied in this thesis combined both approaches. Instead of a wall model for k SGS, zero gradient conditions were selected, i.e. the diffusive flux of turbulent kinetic energy through the surface is zero (Ferziger and Peri´ c, 2002). The SGS viscosityνSGS was calculated explicitly for the whole domain 5 Data Generation except for the cylinder boundary. At the cylinder boundary, Spalding’ s formula for the law of the wall (Spalding, 1961) was used. This wall function provides suitable values for the SGS viscosity over a large range of y+ values and explicitly also for y+.1. 5.03.02 Turbulence Modeling In the LES approach chosen in this thesis, the computational grid acts as a filter (grid filter) separating the larger, resolved scales from the smaller, modeled scales. Hence, the size of the mesh determines the filter width ∆. The mesh was chosen in such a way that more than 80 % of the turbulent kinetic energy is part of the resolved portion, i.e. at wavenumbers smaller than the cutoff wavenumber of the filter. The SGS at higher wavenumbers included only a smaller fraction of the energy. In Fig- ure 2.08, this SGS part is illustrated by the hatched area of the graph. As indicated in Figure 2.08, the cutoff frequency should lie in the inertial range. Then, the modeled portion is in the universal equilibrium range. In the LES approach, the filtered Navier–Stokes equations are solved (Pope, 2000; Davidson, 2004). The quantity that needs to be modeled is the SGS stress tensor τSGS, also called residual stress tensor. A popular method is to use eddy viscosity models. An effective viscosity which is the sum of the molecular viscosity and a SGS viscosity νeff = ν+νSGS (Boussinesq hypothesis) was used in the filtered equations. One Equation Eddy Viscosity Model In this thesis, a dynamic subgrid kinetic energy model (Ghosal et al, 1995; Menon et al, 1996), also referred to as dynamic one equation eddy SGS model, was chosen to model the unresolved portion of turbulence. In the one equation eddy viscosity model by Deardorff, the modeled turbulent kinetic energy k was calculated with an additional transport equation. The SGS stress tensor τSGS was modeled us- ing τSGS i j − 1 3δi j τSGS kk = −2 Ck ∆k 1/2 Si j. (5.011) The strain rate tensor Si,j is given by Si j = 1 (︃∂ui ∂x j + ∂u j ∂xi )︃ (5.012) (cf. Newton’ s lawτi j = 2νSi j, Section 2.02.01 and Section 2.02.05) and Si j denotes its filtered value. 5.03 Large Eddy Simulation The transport equation for the dimensionless SGS turbulent kinetic energy is given by ∂k SGS ∂t +u j ∂k SGS ∂x j = ∂ ∂x j (︃ 1 Reeff ∂k SGS ∂x j )︃ +P −ϵ (5.013) with the production rate and the dissipation defined by P = 2 Si j Si j Re SGS and ϵ = Ce k 3/2 SGS ∆. (5.014) The SGS viscosity as it appears in the effective Reynolds number Re eff is evaluated by νSGS =Ck k 1/2 SGS∆. (5.015) The coefficients are determined to Ce = 1.0048 and Ck = 0.0094 (Open FOAM Founda- tion, 2014) for the standard one equation eddy viscosity model. In the dynamic model (Germano et al, 1991), the coefficients Ce and Ck are adapted locally and dynamically. A test filter with twice the filter width than the grid filter is applied. The constant Ck is determined by solving a variational problem (Ghosal et al, 1995). Measure of Turbulence Resolution The measure of turbulence resolution, often called Pope’ s criterion (Pope, 2000), is the ratio of modeled turbulent kinetic energy to its total value. This measure is given by M = k SGS kres +k SGS (5.016) where kres denotes the resolved turbulent kinetic energy. The modeled turbulent kinetic energy k SGS is a transported quantity and hence available as a field variable for every instant in time. Not the instantaneous value, but the mean (time averaged) quantity was used for this analysis to account for variations in time. The resolved turbulent kinetic energy was evaluated from the filtered velocity field. Generally, the mean kinetic energy of the flow can be decomposed as 〈E〉 =E 0 +k (5.017) where E = 1/2〈u〉〈u〉 is the kinetic energy of the mean flow and k = 1/2〈u′′u′′〉 is the turbulent kinetic energy. Using the fact that the RMS value of a quantity is related to mean and standard deviation by x 2 rms = 〈x〉2 +σ2 = 〈x 2〉 yields kres = 1 (︁ σ2 11 +σ2 22 +σ2 )︁ (5.018) 5 Data Generation 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 Figure 5.06: Measure of Turbulence Resolution. M < 0.02 is considered an adequate resolution for LES (Pope, 2000). for the resolved turbulent kinetic energy. An estimate of σ2 = var(u) was calculated at every time step during the simulation. Pope’ s criterion states that the measure of turbulence resolution should be small, e.g. M < 0.02. Figure 5.06 depicts the criterion for the simulation carried out in this thesis. 5.03.03 Computational Procedure For the LES, a centered scheme was used for the gradients and a flux-limited scheme (“limited linear”) for the divergence terms. The limiter function blends between first order schemes, e.g. upwind scheme (UD), and second order schemes, e.g. central scheme (CD), to ensure the stability of the computation. This is achieved by com- puting an arbitrary variable f using f = f UD +Ψ(r ) (︁ f CD − f UD )︁ (5.019) with flux limiter function Ψ and the ratio of successive gradients r. The flux limiter was chosen not to follow the total variation diminishing approach (Sweby, 1984), but to tend more towards the higher order scheme. As in the two-dimensional cases, a second order time discretization was chosen. To reduce the computational time a maximum CFL number of CFL = 0.05 is applied to determine the time step size. 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations 5.03.04 Data Acquisition The data acquisition procedure is essentially the same as in the laminar cases (cf. Section 5.02.03). The instantaneous Reynolds number Re(t) is taken as an area average from the x = −9 d-plane. Nu(t) and c f (t) are area averages from the cylinder. The spatial proportionment into sectors was discarded as turbulence not only leads to circumferential differences, but also to spanwise fluctuations. Instead only integral values for the whole cylinder were extracted and saved as tabulated time series. 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations Another possibility to generate a linear model for the heat transfer and skin fric- tion dynamics is to linearize the governing equations. This approach was chosen by Apelt and Ledwich to study the behavior of a cylinder in unsteady flow. Ulti- mately, Kwon and Lee used this approach to examine the transfer behavior of a heated wire in the scope of Rijke tube thermoacoustic oscillations. Following the approach by Kwon and Lee, a vorticity–stream function formu- lation was chosen for the Navier–Stokes equations. The advantage of this method is that pressure is dropped from the formulation and only three equations have to be solved in two dimensions. The dimensionless governing equations are presented in Section 2.02.06 (Equation (2.068)–(2.070)). In this approach, a steady-state solution was computed first. The perturbation equations, linearized around this steady state, were solved subsequently. To achieve good results a steady state has to exist. Hence, only Re 0 ≤ 40 was considered for this treatment. With this method, the frequency response of skin friction and heat transfer can be assessed directly without SI or other time series analysis techniques. The frequency response function can be ap- proximated evaluating the response at multiple discrete frequencies for the same steady-state solution. The complete procedure was implemented in MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc. 2016). 5.04.01 Computational Domain and Grid Computational domain and grid are to a great extent based on the basic setup de- scribed in Section 5.01. Especially the resolution close to the surface of the cylinder and the domain size were chosen according to these investigations. The solver, in this case, was written for only this purpose and therefore a very efficient, but other- wise limited method could be implemented using a log-polar grid. 5 Data Generation Figure 5.07: Mesh for LNSE Approach. Mesh shown in real coordinates (left) and in transformed coordinates (right). The domain boundaries are marked with colors. Introducing modified polar coordinates η and φ, the so-called log-polar coordi- nates, yields η = ln (︂r d )︂. (5.020) The transformation to the x–y–system is achieved with x = −eη ·cos(φ) and y = eη ·sin(φ). (5.021) With this transformation, concentric circles around the origin have exponentially growing radius r with linearly growing η. This type of mesh offers two advantages: On the one hand, the region close to the surface of the cylinder is greatly refined. In the far field, however, where gradients are comparably small, the mesh is rather coarse, which reduces the cell count. On the other hand, the governing equations can be formulated like in Cartesian coordinates except for a scaling factor related to the transformation. Figure 5.07 shows the grid created with this approach in x– y–coordinates (left) and in transformed coordinates (right). The mesh was created using the information acquired in the grid independence study in Section 5.01.03. Hence, the following dimensions given in Table 5.07 were used. 5.04.02 Perturbation Equation in Vorticity–Stream Function Form To compute the frequency response to pulsations in the free-stream velocity, i.e. stream function, Equations (2.068) to (2.070) were modified. Harmonic perturbations were introduced for the flow variables stream function ψ, vorticity ζ, and tempera- ture Θ in Equations (2.068) to (2.070). These perturbed quantities are given by ψ = ψ0 +ϵψ1 ei Srt, ζ = ζ0 +ϵζ1 ei Srt, and Θ = Θ0 +ϵΘ1 ei Srt 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations Nc Nη ∆φ ·10−3 ∆η/d ·10−3 Total number of cells 37 53 0.00849 0.00869 1961 73 106 0.00430 0.00434 7738 145 212 0.00217 0.00217 30 740 289 424 0.00109 0.00109 122 536 Table 5.07: Different Meshes Used in the LNSE Approach.Results of the steady-state cell size study for the log-polar grid, Ld = 50, Re 0 = 40, steady state. where ϵ denotes the perturbation amplitude. It serves as a small parameter that is used for bookkeeping in the derivation of the linearized equations, i.e. ultimately only terms of order O(ϵ1) or lower are kept. The flow variables with indices forfeit their dependence on time. The temporal derivative can be computed directly. The resulting equations were separated according to the order of the bookkeeping vari- able ϵ. Terms withϵ0, i.e. zeroth order terms, form the equations for the steady state. These equations are still nonlinear as is the nature of the flow. First order terms amount to the linearized perturbation equations. Terms with higher powers in ϵ were neglected as they become small for ϵ → 0, i.e. small fluctuation amplitudes. Steady-State Equations The zeroth order equations describe the steady-state flow. They are given by ∂2ψ0 ∂η2 + ∂2ψ0 ∂φ2 = −r 2ζ0 (5.022) ∂ζ0 ∂φ ∂ψ0 ∂η − ∂ζ0 ∂η ∂ψ0 ∂φ = 1 Re 0 (︃∂2ζ1 ∂η2 + ∂2ζ1 ∂φ2 )︃ (5.023) ∂Θ0 ∂φ ∂ψ0 ∂η − ∂Θ0 ∂η ∂ψ0 ∂φ = 1 Re 0 Pr (︃∂2Θ1 ∂η2 + ∂2Θ1 ∂φ2 )︃. (5.024) These equations in (φ, η) coordinates are equal to Equations (2.068) to (2.070) in (x, y) coordinates save for the transformation parameter r. The steady-state variables do not depend on time and hence the time derivatives are dropped. Boundary conditions given in primitive variables in Section 5.01.01 had to be trans- lated to the solved variables. In the far field η = ηmax, the stream function was given by the potential flow solution reported in Section 2.02.07, Equation (2.076). The as- sumption of potential flow at this boundary also implies ζ = 0. In order to allow the vorticity created at the surface of the cylinder to leave the domain, the downstream part of the far field boundary is set to zero gradient conditions (( ∂ζ)/(∂η) = 0). The 5 Data Generation temperature of the flow corresponds to the temperature in the far field and thus Θ = 0. In an analogous manner, the far field downstream is set to (∂Θ)/(∂η) = 0. At the surface of the cylinder, the application of a no-slip boundary is not trivial with the given variables. Both the velocity through the surface and the slip along the surface have to be zero. The first requirement is fulfilled by setting ψ = 0 at the boundary. The gradient of the stream function vanishes in circumferential direction which leads to (∂ψ)/(∂φ) = uη = 0. This is also in accordance with the potential flow solution. The second requirement is then formulated, by the use of Equation (2.068), in plain Cartesian coordinates as ∂2ψ ∂η2 +ζ = 0. (5.025) Hence, a wall vorticity enforcing the no-slip condition had to be calculated. This also shows that the surface of the cylinder is the (only) source of vorticity. Follow- ing the approach discussed in Section 2.02.05 the temperature at the surface of the cylinder is fixed and therefore Θw = 1. Parallel to the flow to the windward and to the lee side of the cylinder are symme- try boundaries. The flow velocity is determined by the derivatives of the stream function. No flow crosses the symmetry boundary which dictates that the stream function has to be constant along it. With the defined value of ψ = 0 at the surface of the cylinder, this condition also applies to the symmetry boundaries. In this po- sition, vorticity also cancels to ζ = 0 as any mirrored flow feature exhibits a vorticity with opposite sign. The temperature gradient vanishes at the symmetry condition, i.e. (∂θ)/(∂η) = 0. The boundary conditions are summarized as η = ln(1/2) ψ0 = 0 ζ0 = ζ0,w Θ0 = 1 (5.026) η → ∞ ψ0 = u 0,∞ r sin(φ) ∂ζ0 ∂η = 0 Θ0 = 0 (5.027) φ = 0 ψ0 = 0 ζ0 = 0 ∂Θ0 ∂φ = 0 (5.028) φ = 2π ψ 0 = 0 ζ0 = 0 ∂Θ0 ∂φ = 0. (5.029) To quantify skin friction and heat transfer, the steady-state friction coefficient and the steady-state Nußelt number were computed using Nu 0,φ = ∂Θ0 ∂η ⃓⃓⃓⃓ η=ln(1/2) and c f,x,0,φ = 2 Re 0 ζ0,w sin(φ). (5.030) 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations Perturbation Equations In the perturbation equations or first order equations, the terms of order O(ϵ) are collected. The equations read ∂2ψ1 ∂η2 + ∂2ψ1 ∂φ2 = −r 2ζ1 (5.031) i Srr 2ζ1 + ∂ζ1 ∂φ ∂ψ0 ∂η − ∂ζ1 ∂η ∂ψ0 ∂φ + ∂ζ0 ∂φ ∂ψ1 ∂η − ∂ζ0 ∂η ∂ψ1 ∂φ = 1 Re 0 (︃∂2ζ1 ∂η2 + ∂2ζ1 ∂φ2 )︃ (5.032) i Srr 2Θ1 + ∂Θ1 ∂φ ∂ψ0 ∂η − ∂Θ1 ∂η ∂ψ0 ∂φ + ∂Θ0 ∂φ ∂ψ1 ∂η − ∂Θ0 ∂η ∂ψ1 ∂φ = 1 Re 0 Pr (︃∂2Θ1 ∂η2 + ∂2Θ1 ∂φ2 )︃. (5.033) Time derivatives are resolved explicitly with ( ∂ζ1 ei Srt )/(∂t) = i Srζ1 ei Srt and the transformation parameter r. The boundary conditions for the perturbation equations are very similar to those of the steady state. Besides the fact that these boundary conditions apply to the perturbed quantities ψ1, ζ1, and Θ1 the main differences concern the stream func- tion at the far field boundary and the temperature at the surface of the cylinder. The stream function is directly linked to the excitation as it decides upon the free-stream velocity. Hence, it is computed from the potential flow solution with the pertur- bation velocity in the far field u 1,∞ = ϵu 0,∞. The temperature at the cylinder is a Dirichlet boundary condition. It is fixed to a given value and henceΘ0 = 1. This also dictates, that no pulsations may occur at the surface of the cylinder or otherwise this condition would be violated. It follows from this that the pulsating quantity is zero Θ1 = 0 at this position. Summarizing, the boundary conditions for the periodic fluctuations are given by η = ln(1/2) : ψ1 = 0 ζ1 = ζ1,w Θ1 = 0 (5.034) η → ∞: ψ1 = u 1,∞ r sin(φ) ∂ζ1 ∂η = 0 Θ1 = 0 (5.035) φ = 0 : ψ1 = 0 ζ1 = 0 ∂Θ1 ∂φ = 0 (5.036) φ = 2π : ψ1 = 0 ζ1 = 0 ∂Θ1 ∂φ = 0. (5.037) Analogous to the steady state, the Nußelt number and the friction coefficient of the fluctuations are computed by Nu 1,φ = ∂Θ1 ∂η ⃓⃓⃓⃓ η=ln(1/2) and c f,x,1,φ = 2 Re 0 ζ1,w sin(φ). (5.038) 5 Data Generation 5.04.03 Finite Difference Approach The governing equations in stream function vorticity formulation (Equation (5.022) to Equation (5.024) and Equation (5.031) to Equation (5.033)) were solved using a finite difference approach on a log-polar grid (Thom, 1933; Fornberg, 1980; Kwon and Lee, 1985). On an equidistant, rectangular grid such as the one employed in this case (cf. Fig- ure?), the finite difference formulation is equal to the finite volume formulation. Therefore, it is argued that this approach offers similar accuracy as state of the art tools using the finite volume approach, e.g. Open FOAM. Derivatives were approximated using central differences and thus second order ac- curacy in space was achieved. For any given flow variable f, the central difference is given by ∂f ∂η ≈ fi +1,j − fi −1,j 2∆η and ∂f ∂φ ≈ fi,j +1 − fi,j −1 2∆φ. (5.039) Second derivatives were approximated by ∂2 f ∂η2 ≈ fi +1,j −2 fi,j + fi −1,j (∆η)2 and ∂2 f ∂φ2 ≈ fi,j +1 −2 fi,j + fi,j −1 (∆φ)2 (5.040) which also is a central difference. At the boundaries, one sided differences of second order were used. Vorticity at the Surface of the Cylinder The vorticity at the surface is an important factor in these simulations. The wall boundary conditions, i.e. no-slip and no penetration, have to be enforced. The no- slip condition is violated by the potential flow solution, and the vorticity has to be calculated to counteract. Thom developed a formula that provides first order accuracy. In this thesis, the equation ζw = 1 r 2 8ψi −1,j −ψi −2,j (∆η)2 was used, which is second order accurate (Weinan and Liu, 1996). With this approxi- mation, slip cannot be suppressed completely. Hence, the slip velocity (∂ψ)/(∂η) ⃓⃓ w is used as a secondary criterion for convergence and quality of the results. 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations 5.04.04 Computational Procedure Steady State To evaluate the linearized equations, it was first necessary to find a steady state at which the linearization is carried out. This was achieved by solving the nonlinear equations sequentially. The nonlinear equation system was solved by using an initial velocity, calculated from the potential equations (cf. Section 2.02.07), to evaluate the stream function. The derivative of the stream function was used as the velocity in the subsequent iteration. The vorticity generated at the surface of the cylinder to fulfill the no-slip condition was propagated. This procedure was repeated until changes in the solu- tion were small compared to the initial change. Convergence was improved through the use of a relaxation factor. Figure 5.08 depicts a flow chart of the iterative proce- dure. The temperature is not coupled with the other equations and could hence be calculated in a final step outside the iteration loop. The change in vorticity normalized with the vorticity after the first iteration written as σ = ∥ζ(i )∥−∥ ζ(i −1)∥ ∥ζ(1)∥ (5.041) was used as the convergence criterion. Additionally, the slip velocity at the surface of the cylinder ( ∂ψ)/(∂η) was evaluated to check for the fulfillment of the no-slip boundary condition. A relaxation factor ρ was applied to the wall vorticity. The relaxed vorticity at the surface was computed for the i th iteration with ζ∗ w = ρζ(i ) w +(1 −ρ)ζ(i −1) w. (5.042) The relaxation factor had to be very small initially ( ρ ≈ 0.005). To find an optimum between stability and convergence, the relaxation factor was adapted. Depending on the behavior of the convergence criterion, the relaxation factor was adjusted. If σ rose from one iteration to the next, ρ was decreased to enhance stability. Vice versa, ρ was increased for even faster convergence, if σ dropped rapidly. To make this adaptive relaxation scheme robust,ρ was forced to stay in the interval [0.0001,1]. The simulation was restarted with a lower initial value for ρ if the solution diverged fatally. This algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear coupled steady-state equation sys- tem, although it may seem crude, proved to be more efficient than the built-in MAT- LAB (The Math Works, Inc. 2016) function provided by the optimization toolbox. 5 Data Generation compute ζ0,w compute velocity compute ζ0 compute ψ0 control convergence convergence? yes no initialize save data compute Θ0 Figure 5.08: Flowchart of the Steady-State Solver. Perturbed Quantities The first order equations are linear and can hence be solved efficiently by using the matrix left division function from MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc. 2016, mldi- vide “\\”). The equations for stream function and vorticity are coupled, and they are hence collected in a single system matrix. For convenience also the temperature is induced. This is not strictly necessary and can also be calculated sequentially. The structure of the matrix can be depicted as ⎡ ⎣ Aψ Bψζ 0 Cζ,ψ Aζ 0 0 0 Aθ ⎤ ⎦ ⎡ ⎣ ψ ζ Θ ⎤ ⎦= ⎡ ⎣ ψ ζ Θ ⎤ ⎦ δΩ. (5.043) The finite difference stencil for the respective Equation (5.031) to (5.033) is included in Aψ, Aζ, and AΘ. The submatrix Bψ,ζ couples the vorticity with the stream function equations. In an analogous manner, the derivatives of the stream function (veloci- ties) are coupled with the vorticity equation through Cζ,ψ. δΩ denotes the boundary 5.04 Linearized Navier Stokes Equations conditions. The terms i Sr r 2 ζ1 and i Srr 2 Θ1 serve as source terms and are included through the diagonals in Aζ and AΘ. Excitation The excitation is equivalent to a sine wave excitation as detailed in Section 5.02.01. In time domain it is given by Re(t) = Re 0 (1 +ϵ sin(Srt)). (5.09) In the frequency domain approach with the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, this is achieved in two steps. The amplitude ϵ is specified in the boundary condition for the stream function pulsation ψ1,η→∞ = u 0,∞ ϵ·r ·sin(φ). (5.044) The frequency, i.e. the Strouhal number Sr, is included in the system matrix, in the i Srr 2 ζ1 and i Sr r 2 Θ1 term, and can be specified according to the desired excitation. 5.04.05 Acquisition of Frequency Domain Data The steady-state solver was used to find a solution ( ψ0, ζ0, and Θ0) for a specified mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 and Prandtl number Pr. These converged results were used to compute the fluctuating quantities ( ψ1, ζ1, and Θ1) at the same Re 0 and Pr and at specified frequencies Sr. The frequencies were chosen from the inter- val of interest. A smaller distance between sequential frequencies was used in regions where greater changes were assumed. The frequency response for the heat transfer and the skin friction at each Strouhal number was evaluated using Equation (2.0101) in the form GNu(Sr) = Nu 1(Sr)/Nu 0 ϵ and Gc f (Sr) = c f,1(Sr)/c f,0 ϵ. (5.045) This frequency response data serves as input for the continuous time identification procedure introduced in Section 4.04.05. Results are presented in Section 6.02. 5.04.06 Discussion and Outlook For Reynolds numbers higher than the onset of vortex shedding, which occurs around Re ≈ 47 (cf. Table 2.01), no steady-state solution exists. The dynamics of the wake are inherently unsteady but repeat periodically. Fornberg computed steady-state solutions even beyond this threshold up to Re = 300. However, these 5 Data Generation solutions are found numerically by neglecting the time derivative in the Navier– Stokes equations and are not physically meaningful. A possible approach would be to compute cycle averaged solutions for the flow fields (ψ0, ζ0, and Θ0) and subsequently calculate the linearized perturbation vari- ables. Without further improvements, this would not yield acceptable results and is thus beyond the scope of this thesis. This approach to acquiring the frequency response of the skin friction and the heat transfer of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow proved to be very efficient. Depend- ing on the desired accuracy, the same results as computed with the time domain computation in a matter of days was obtained in several minutes. However, this method is limited to the flow regime Re 0. 40, where no vortex shedding occurs. Another limitation is that the type of mesh chosen in this thesis is restricted to cylinder geometries. This can be circumvented by the use of specialized software, e.g. finite element solvers for unstructured grids. Besides this, the main advantage of this method is its high accuracy combined with low computational cost. 6 Transfer Function Identification This section deals with different methods to identify transfer functions from free- stream velocity pulsations to heat transfer and skin friction from CFD data. A direct approach might be to simulate the system introducing an impulse in the inlet veloc- ity. The response, acquired during the simulation, would be the impulse response, which completely quantifies the LTI system. A transfer function is achieved by ap- plying the Laplace transform (or Z-transform in discrete time) on the unit impulse response. However, this method is not feasible. The available numerical procedures cannot conserve the forcing impulse which would lead to a deteriorated response. A better approach, from a numerical point of view, is to use step excitation instead. The post-processing of a step response is straightforward. This is shown in Sec- tion 6.01, where also methods to acquire a transfer function are discussed. Simulating a step response can often be used as a preliminary tool to gain information vital for more sophisticated identification methods. Another approach, often used in experiments, is the excitation with a single fre- quency Sri (u(t) = Au sin(Sri t)). The response for an LTI system is again a sine wave, but usually with different amplitude and shifted in time. These time series can be evaluated using the Fourier transform, so the response at this particular frequency is G(Sri ) = yˆ(Sri ) uˆ (Sri ). (6.01) Repeating this procedure for multiple frequencies in the range of interest leads to a typical frequency response that can be further processed to form a transfer function. This has some advantages over an impulse excitation or step excitation and is usually directly implemented in experiments. Advantages are that the exci- tation amplitude can be chosen for each frequency individually and the influence of disturbances can be minimized by using several periods of the same frequency. However, use of CFD simulations in the time domain to generate the data is rather time consuming. For every frequency, a simulation has to be carried out over several periods of the given excitation frequency. In Section 5.04, a method was introduced to acquire a frequency response by simulating in the frequency domain. In Section 6.02, SI is applied to the frequency response yielding a transfer function. Section 6.03 deals with the application of the CFD/SI approach. The data acquired from time domain simulations (cf. Section 5.02 and Section 5.03) is processed with methods introduced in Section 4.04. Instead of an impulse, a step or sine waves, per- 6 Transfer Function Identification sistent excitation is used together with SI techniques to develop the desired transfer function. 6.01 Step Response The adaptation of the boundary layers after changes in the free-stream velocity controls the dynamics of the transfer of momentum and heat in the unsteady case. Payne studied starting flow past a cylinder at moderate Reynolds numbers, using numerical integration of Helmholtz’ s vorticity equation. In a similar manner, Apelt and Ledwich studied the response of drag force and heat transfer of a heated cylinder to impulsive forcing from rest, as well as impulsive increases in velocities by 50 %. The step response technique was also used by Surendran et al to study the dynamic behavior of a cold heat exchanger in flue gas crossflow. In this thesis, the development of the boundary layers and the heat transfer rate and skin friction in response to a sudden, small increase of the free-stream velocity by 10 % (step forcing) are investigated. The results obtained with the step input are simpler to interpret physically than the response to periodic perturbations and can be used to elucidate effects observed in the case of the periodic velocity pulsations (see below). The work shown here was previously published in parts in Witte and Polifke (2017 a). The step response is an immediate output of the computation with data acquisi- tion procedures as described above (cf. Section 5.02.02). For reasons of simplicity, the time instant when the step occurs was chosen to be ts = 0. The response is given as reported in Equation (4.0127) by Nu′(t) = Nu(t) −Nu(0) and c′ f (t) = c f (t) −c f (0) (6.02) where Nu(0) = Nu 0 and c f (0) = c f,0 denote the (steady-state) Nußelt number and friction coefficient before the step input, respectively. The unit step responses were calculated with h Nu(t) = Nu′(t) /︂ Nu(0) Re′(t) /︂ Re(0) = Nu′(t) ϵNu(0) and hc f (t) = c′ f (t) /︂ c f (0) Re′(t) /︂ Re(0) = c′ f (t) ϵc f (0) (6.03) where the Nußelt number and the friction coefficient are normalized with their re- spective steady-state value before the step. The computed response is scaled with the strength of the perturbation ϵ to yield a unit step response, although the excita- tion was weaker than unity. This scaling is valid as it was assumed to be within the limits of linearity. After this step, the simulation was continued with constant input 6.01 Step Response until the output did not change anymore, i.e. the flow had adopted to a new steady state. From the unit step response, apart from qualitative insight into the flow dynamics, the quasi-steady gain K can be assessed easily. The gain corresponds to the value of the unit step response when a new steady state is reached. This is also the limit of the unit step response for very long times KNu = h Nu(t → ∞) and Kc f = hc f (t → ∞) and again appear as low frequency limits in the frequency responses (cf. Section 6.05). In the following sections, results for the unit step responses h Nu and hc f as simu- lated directly are shown. Snapshots of the temperature field surrounding the cylin- der at discrete instants in time at two Reynolds numbers are reported in Section 7.02. The investigated Reynolds numbers (Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40) correspond to the three flow regimes of creeping flow, attached flow, and flow with recircula- tion in wake without vortex shedding. This corresponds to the flow conditions of interest for the Rijke tube and hot-wire anemometry. However, the vortex shedding phenomenon limits this approach also to Re 0. 40, because the changes in Nußelt number and friction coefficient due to this unsteady behavior severely impede the results. In other words, no steady state exists above the threshold for vortex shed- ding, which complicates the interpretation of the results drastically. 6.01.01 Heat Transfer Full Cylinder The temporal development of the response is depicted in Figure 6.01. The thick solid lines represent the response evaluated directly from simulations with a step input. The dashed line denotes the steady-state gain (taken at t = 80 for Re 0 = 0.04 and at t = 20 for Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40). For comparison, the step responses computed from a transfer function identified with the CFD/SI approach (cf. Section 6.03) are depicted as dash dotted lines. The sudden increase in the inlet velocity leads to a rise in the heat transfer rate. For Re 0 = 40, the heat transfer increases rapidly until a local maximum is reached near t ≈ 1.05. At lower mean flow Reynolds numbers, this peak is less pronounced and occurs at later times ( t ≈ 5 for Re 0 = 4) or not at all (Re 0 = 0.04). All step responses approach a new steady-state value KNu. This value is smaller if the Reynolds num- ber is smaller. The limits for t → ∞are KNu = 0.025, KNu = 0.037, and KNu = 0.042 for Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40, respectively. The step response shows that at low Reynolds numbers the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer rate can be interpreted as a single, comparatively large time scale that governs the time delay until a new steady-state value is reached.

Dash dotted lines ( ) represent the response evaluated with the CFD/SI method. Reynolds numbers (Re 0 = 4), this dominant time scale becomes shorter and a sec- ond effect appears. It is visible as a local maximum in the response. This effect has a different time scale and is even stronger at Re 0 = 40. Circumferential Distribution In order to gain more insight into spatial differences of the temporal development of the heat transfer, four equally sized sectors were examined separately. The sectors, as marked in Figure 5.02, are labeled 1 to 4 starting at the windward side of the cylin- der. The choice is justified by the different flow regimes that are present at various locations (cf. Section 5.02.03). The step response of the individual sectors is computed with h Nu,i (t) = Nu′ i (t) ϵNu(0) (6.04) where i = 1, 2, 3, 4 denotes the sector. Figure 6.02 shows the Nußelt number gain nor- malized with the area of the whole cylinder for Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40. The sum of the four curves results in the graph shown in Figure 6.01. 6.01 Step Response 0 5 10 15 20−0.005 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 0.020 0.025 t h Nu,i (t) 0 5 10 15 20 t 0 5 10 15 20 t (a) (b) (c) Figure 6.02: Unit Step Response of Heat Transfer for Individual Sectors. Sectors: 1 ( ), 2 ( ), 3 ( ), and 4 ( ). Mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 0.04 (a), Re 0 = 4 (b), and Re 0 = 40 (c). The responses of the individual sectors are normalized with the heat transfer at the full (half) cylinder. At the lowest Reynolds number (Re 0 = 4, cf. Figure 6.02 (a)), it can be seen that sectors 1 through 3 show a behavior very similar to the complete cylinder. The sector 1 contributes most to the overall heat transfer followed by sector 2 and sector 3 and thus they show the highest gain. However, the behavior of sector 4 differs. It drops below the initial steady-state value directly after the step input occurred. At about t = 2.05 after the perturbation, the heat transfer becomes greater than in steady state again and settles asymptotically to a value below that of the sector 3. The flow configurations with Re 0 = 4 (Figure 6.02(b)) and Re 0 = 40 (Figure 6.02(c)) show essentially the same characteristics. In contrast to Re 0 = 0.04, a peak response occurs for Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40 in sectors 1 to 3, which again determine the behavior of the complete cylinder to the largest extent. For higher Reynolds numbers, these maxima are more pronounced and occur shortly after the step input. The occur- rence of the peak is strongest in sector 3, which includes the flow separation point. The relative contribution of the windward side of the cylinder is greater for higher Reynolds numbers. 6 Transfer Function Identification 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 200 t hc f (t) 0 0.05 1 1.05 21 1.05 2.05 Figure 6.03: Unit Step Response of Skin Friction.

Dash dotted lines ( ) represent the response evaluated with the CFD/SI method. 6.01.02 Skin Friction Full Cylinder Like the step response of the heat transfer, the temporal evolution of the skin friction is shown. Figure 6.03 depicts the normalized response of the friction coefficient to step forcing. The thick solid lines represent the response evaluated directly from simulations with a step input. The dashed line denotes the steady-state gain (taken at t = 20 for Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40 and at t = 80 for Re 0 = 0.04). For comparison, the step responses computed from transfer functions that were identified with the CFD/SI approach (cf. Section 6.03) are plotted as dash dotted lines. The skin friction responds instantly to the step input by assuming large values. The following decrease is very steep as well, but slows down eventually. This restoration process is due to the transport of excess vorticity, created when the step excitation takes place, away from the surface of the cylinder. The friction coefficient settles to a new steady state above the initial conditions, but much lower than the peak. The restoration is fastest for Re 0 = 0.04 and slowest for Re 0 = 40. The new steady-state value, equivalent to the steady-state gain Kc f = 1.0242, Kc f = 1.0414, and Kc f = 1.0450 for Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40, respectively. 6.01 Step Response 0 1 2 3 4 5−0.05 0.05 1.05 t hc f,i (t) 0 1 2 3 4 5 t 0 1 2 3 4 5 t (a) (b) (c) Figure 6.04: Unit Step Response of Individual Sectors.

The responses of the individual sectors are normalized with the skin fric- tion at the full (half) cylinder. The peak values are only limited by the numerical procedure and reach such high values because an incompressible fluid is assumed. Such a harsh peak is associated with very high frequencies, for which the compactness assumption (c.f. Section 9.01.03) does not strictly hold. Nevertheless, the delay in returning to a steady state is captured adequately. Circumferential Distribution Figure 6.04 depicts the response of the individual sectors 1 to 4 of the skin friction coefficient to step forcing. Graphs are given for (a) Re 0 = 0.04, (b) Re 0 = 4, and (c) Re 0 = 40. The behavior of each individual sector is very similar to the full cylinder given in Figure 6.03. For the heat transfer, a clear trend was apparent: Most heat is transferred close to the forward stagnation point, and the heat transfer declines towards the backward stagnation point. This is not the case for the skin friction. For all Reynolds numbers, the strongest response is observed in sector 2. This is in accordance with the position of the greatest steady-state skin friction (cf. Sec- tion 2.01.02, Figure 2.04). Immediately after the step excitation, the friction coefficient experiences the second largest change in sector 3. At Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40, however, it is overtaken by sector 1 which adapts faster, but finally assumes 6 Transfer Function Identification Re 0 Steady-state gain Rise time 0 %–63.02 % Rise time 10 %–90 % Overshoot in % 0.04 0.02495 6.00289 16.08758 0 4 0.03649 0.09124 2.01246 2.096 40 0.04161 0.02378 0.04091 18.095 Table 6.01: Step Response Characteristics of Heat Transfer. a new steady state with a relative change above sector 3. When a recirculation zone exists at the lee side of the cylinder, friction values are negative. This can be ob- served in plot (c) at Re 0 = 40 where the steady state of sector 4 is negative, which corresponds to a stronger recirculation in the new steady state (Re = 44). The skin friction response in sector 4 (cf. Figure 6.04 (c)) is positive untilt ≈ 0.07. This indicates that the recirculation zone collapses and is restored over time to the new steady state. The reason for this is the strong pressure gradient necessary to accelerate the flow to the new velocity from one time step in the simulation to the next. The adverse pressure gradient that leads to flow separation and hence recirculation is counteracted. The pressure becomes favorable, and the flow stays attached to the surface of the cylinder. This effect only holds as long as the acceleration occurs, i.e. as long as there is a strong external pressure gradient. In the restoration process, the pressure gradient at the cylinder switches back instantly, and the flow starts to detach again. This process becomes even more apparent in the flow-field represen- tation in Section 7.02. 6.01.03 Characterization of Dynamic Behavior The basic dynamic characteristics, i.e. simplified dynamics, can be quantified by a few parameters. These parameters can be gained from the step response. They in- clude the steady-state gain, the rise time or fall time associated with a time constant, the overshoot over the final new steady state, and the dead time which is the time it takes the system to show a significant response (cf. Section 4.03.04). The latter is not relevant in the cases under investigation, as all systems respond instantaneously and is hence not considered further. In accordance with the theory of LTI systems (cf. Section 4.01), the step response pro- vides a complete description of the system. Characteristic quantities describing the dynamics are obtained simply by graphical evaluation. This information can also be used as prior knowledge for more sophisticated methods of SI. The characteristic quantities, as mentioned in Section 4.03.04, are given in Table 6.01 for the heat transfer. 6.01 Step Response Re 0 Steady-state gain Time to settle to K ·(1 ±0.01) 0.04 1.0242 3.0884 4 1.0414 2.0421 40 1.0450 5.0651 Table 6.02: Step Response Characteristics of Skin Friction. The steady-state gain and the rise time from 0 % to 63.02 % (= 1 −e−1) describe a first order time lag behavior. More accurately, they represent KNu and cτ from the first order model G = KNu/(1 +cτ Sr) (cf. Section 8.01.02). The rise time is a measure for the time scale of the dynamics. It can be used to determine an adequate sampling for further processing. The recommended time step sizes Ts for an impulse response model are τ/10 – τ/4 for control purposes, but might be higher depending on the application (Åström and Wittenmark, 1997). This leads to the recommended sampling time steps ofτs = 0.06029, τs = 0.00912, and τs = 0.00238 for Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40, respectively. These correspond to Nyquist Strouhal numbers of Sr = 5.02109, Sr = 34.04320, and Sr = 132.01096, respec- tively. A similar analysis can be carried out for the friction coefficient. Due to the shape of the skin friction step response, it is reasonable to compute a settling time instead of a rise or fall time. The settling time chosen in this thesis is defined as the time re- quired to reach a value within some error margin around the final new steady-state value. The chosen error is 10 % and hence the settling time is the duration from the occurrence of the step until |hc f /Kc f −1| <0.01. Steady-state gain and settling time for the skin friction step response of the investigated mean flow Reynolds numbers are listed in Table 6.02. The settling times calculated from the step response of the skin friction are well within the range of the rise times of the heat transfer step response. Therefore, the derivation of the time step size still holds. It is noteworthy that the settling time does not behave monotonically like the heat transfer rise time. The case with Re 0 = 4 is quickest to settle to a value slightly below the predicted steady-state gain of 3/2 (Lighthill, 1954). This also holds for Re 0 = 40 although the time necessary to reach the 10 % bounds is more than twice as high. The settling time for the smallest Reynolds number is in between the other values, but the new steady-state value is lower. This effect can be attributed to the change in circumferential distribution (cf. Section 6.01.02). This corresponds to the expectation that the drag scales linearly with velocity at low Reynolds numbers (linear drag regime). 6 Transfer Function Identification 6.01.04 Transfer Function from Step Simulation Data Within the framework of LTI systems, it is possible to acquire a transfer function for heat transfer and skin friction pulsations caused by pulsations in the free-stream velocity from a step response. Four different methods were surveyed to achieve this goal: (1) Use the time series of step input and step response to perform SI. (2) Compute a frequency response first using FFT and subsequently identify a trans- fer function from frequency data. From the discrete data, acquired from the CFD simulation, an impulse response can be computed with an approximation of the derivative. This leads to method (3) which uses the impulse response directly as coefficients of an FIR model. (4) Compute the frequency response from the impulse response padded with zeros and perform identification on the frequency data. Choice of Method Method (1), the use of the CFD/SI procedure directly on step response data, was rejected because the input signal is not optimal for SI. The PSD of the signal is signif- icantly diminished at high frequencies, and hence inaccurate results are expected. The broadband excitation (cf. Section 6.03) provides better results at almost the same effort. A frequency response is gained computing the element-wise (frequency-wise) quo- tient written as G(Sr) = hˆ ϵHˆ (6.05) where Hˆ denotes the Fourier transform of the Heaviside step function. Continuous time identification can be used to develop a transfer function (method (2)). The fre- quency resolution of the FFT is determined by the length of the time series. A better resolution can be achieved by appending the last value of the times series (the new steady-state value) multiple times. This is allowed as the value should not change as long as the input is constant. A discrete Fourier transform of the Heaviside step function, however, leads to zeros at certain frequencies in the transformed quantity. This is not desirable because at these frequencies the computation of the frequency response is inaccurate or fails completely. Therefore, this method was rejected as well. The step response h[k] is the integral of the impulse response g [k]. Hence, the im- pulse response can be computed from the step response data with finite differences given by g [k] = h[k] −h[k −1] Ts. (6.06) 6.01 Step Response These impulse response coefficients g [k] can directly serve as the coefficients of an FIR model. Mathematically, this corresponds to the application of the Z-transform on the computed data. This method is straightforward, but the FIR model has cer- tain disadvantages like a large number of coefficients depending on the time step size. Thus, method (3) was also rejected in favor of method (4). The most promising procedure to acquire a transfer function from step response data is detailed in the following. Data Preparation The time series data was acquired from the simulation as described in Section 5.02.03. The computations were performed with variable time step to ensure a constant CFL number. These time steps are usually much smaller than the desired maximum fre- quency to ensure a certain smoothness of the signals. For further processing, the time series were linearly interpolated to a constant sampling time step equivalent to the smallest time step of the simulation. This occurs at rates much higher than the range of interest where the PSD of the signal is low. Hence, the information loss and the aliasing introduced by the interpolation are minimal. Subsequently, an anti-aliasing filter was applied to the time series, and they are downsampled to a bandwidth Strouhal number Sr = 240. This is still six times higher than the maximum frequency of interest, but the amount of data is reduced considerably. Frequency Response At first, the impulse response was computed from the step response data using Equation (6.06). The final steady-state value, which is zero in the case of a BIBO stable system such as the one at hand, was appended to the original time series to enhance the frequency resolution of the Fourier transform in the consecutive step. To acquire a frequency response, it is only necessary to compute the Fourier transform of the impulse response. The Fourier transform of the unit impulse is unity, i.e. it is the neutral element in frequency space, and a frequency-wise division like in the case of the step response is not required. This avoids the problem arising in the ill-conditioned computation of the frequency response directly from the step response. The frequency response computed from step response data is shown in Figure 6.05 for the heat transfer pulsations caused by velocity pulsations and in Figure 6.06 for the skin friction as solid lines. For comparison, the frequency response of the trans- fer function computed in Section 6.03 are included as dashed lines. It can be seen that indeed for the investigated mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40 the results are very similar and only minor deviations are visible.

For comparison, results from CFD/SI are depicted as dash-dotted lines ( ). largest discrepancies occur for skin friction at the lowest Reynolds number and high frequencies. Transfer Function The frequency response can be used to compute transfer functions with the meth- ods of identification of continuous time models (cf. Section 4.04.05) in particular VF related methods. The frequency response, computed as shown above, is acceptably smooth as can be seen in Figure 6.05 and Figure 6.06. Hence, the identification with VF is straightforward, and the results are expected to be very similar to that of the CFD/SI method. Details and results from the transfer function identification are omitted at this point and are reported in the following sections associated with the LNSE approach and the CFD/SI approach. 6.02 Transfer Function from LNSE The LNSE provide a method to compute the frequency response directly by simu- lation in frequency space (Kwon and Lee, 1985).

The steady-state flow field was computed for a specified mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 ≤ 40 and Prandtl num- ber Pr = 0.07123. Based on this steady-state solutions, the linearized perturbation equations were solved for 50 logarithmically spaced Strouhal numbers in the range [0.001,40]. From the temperature fields and their derivatives in radial direction, the steady- state Nußelt Nu 0 number and the perturbed Nußelt Nu ′ number were calculated. The values were subsequently averaged over the circumference of the cylinder, and a frequency response was calculated (cf. Section 5.04.05). The frequency response function was approximated by the discrete values at 50 Strouhal numbers. In an analogous manner, the friction coefficient c f was calculated from the vortic- ity fields. This frequency response data was used to identify transfer functions for heat transfer and skin friction from velocity perturbation at Re 0 ∈ {0.01, 0.02,0.04, 0.05, 0.07,1.00, 2.00,3.00, 4.00,10.00,20.00, 40.00}. 6.02.01 Identification from Frequency Response Data Continuous time transfer functions were identified using the VF technique detailed in Section 4.04.05. The input for the VF method is the frequency response of the 6 Transfer Function Identification 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-π -π/2 π/2 π Sr ∠GNu Figure 6.07: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer from LNSE.Re 0 = 0.04 ( ), Re 0 = 4 ( ), and Re 0 = 40 ( ). Step simulation ( ), CFD/SI ( ). heat transfer ( GNu(Sr)) and the skin friction ( Gc f (Sr)) to pulsations in free-stream velocity, respectively. The VF method does not require the frequency samples to be evenly distributed. The frequency samples are logarithmically distributed over the Strouhal number range [0.001,40] with a higher density of samples at low frequencies. This spacing was chosen to credit the fact that changes, especially in phase, are stronger at lower frequencies. A logarithmic spacing, however, shifts more weight to low frequencies in the identification process. This is desired for the skin friction. For the heat transfer, this was partially counteracted by using the inverse frequency response gain |1/GNu(Sr)| as weighting vector. Stability of the resulting transfer func- tions was enforced by pole flipping. 6.02.02 Results Figure 6.07 depicts the heat transfer frequency response GNu(Sr) of the identified transfer functions for the mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40. For comparison, the result from the time domain CFD/SI approach are included as dash dotted lines. Both solution techniques lead to very similar results also observed in the frequency response computed from step response data in Fig- ure 6.05. Correspondingly, the frequency response of the skin friction Gc f (Sr) to pulsations in the free-stream velocity are depicted in Figure 6.08.

Step simulation ( ), CFD/SI ( ). resenting the transfer functions identified from data from the LNSE, matches well with the response evaluated with the CFD/SI approach (dash dotted lines). In consideration of the good match between the models evaluated from LNSE and CFD/SI, only the results acquired from CFD/SI are reported in Section 6.04 for the parameter study. For completeness the fit values and transfer function from the LNSE approach are reported in Appendix A. 6.03 CFD/SI The CFD/SI method, combining numerical simulation with SI was proposed by Po- lifke et al. It has been applied to various problems in aero-acoustics and thermo-acoustics (Polifke, 2014). The identification of the transfer function of the heat transfer was published in Witte et al (2016 a,b); Witte and Polifke (2017 a). Figure 6.09 illustrates the procedure in a flow chart: First, an unsteady CFD simu- lation of flow and heat transfer around the cylinder with imposed excitation of the free-stream velocity is conducted. Specifically, a spatially homogeneous, broadband perturbation signal u∞(t) is imposed as inflow velocity. The Reynolds number of the axial velocity upstream of the cylinder Re represents the input. The Nußelt number of the heat transfer Nu, as well as the friction coefficient between the surface of the cylinder and fluid c f, are used as the outputs. Second, a transfer function is iden- 6 Transfer Function Identification Re Nu c f ident. procedure linear model validation model Figure 6.09: Diagram of the CFD/SI Approach. tified from input and output data using SI methods. Continuous time and discrete time identification techniques were considered. Subsequently, the transfer function is validated, i.e. the model quality is assessed. The best model for each mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 is reported in Section 6.04. The CFD/SI approach allows to determine the response function over a wide fre- quency range using data from a single CFD simulation with broadband excitation. In contrast, the FFT approach, based on forcing with a single frequency, requires one simulation per frequency. Other types of signals, e.g. sums of sinusoids, chirps, or sawtooth signals, have also been used in the past but did not perform as effi- ciently as broadband noise. This is due to the fact that the latter provides high and constant power spectral density over all frequencies of interest. Hence, the excita- tion is persistent and limited in amplitude (Tangirala, 2014). Moreover, different signal time series can be designed to be decorrelated. This allows extending the available time series for identification by simply concatenating the series of two separate experiments or simulations. For the identification with multiple inputs (MISO or MIMO systems), decorrelated excitation signals allow the SI procedure to distinguish between the inputs. Numerous SI procedures and auxiliary tools are implemented in MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc. 2016). The CFD/SI procedure can be divided into five main steps: After an input signal is created with the desired properties and the solver is set up to give an accurate representation of the underlying physics, this signal is used in the CFD simulation. During the computation, time advances and time series are acquired at every time step. These time series are used for parameter estimation and 6.03 CFD/SI for validation. This data is processed and eventually fed to the identification rou- tine. A model based on the data is fitted by the identification algorithm, i.e. model parameters are estimated. The structure of the model as well as other settings and the choice of routines is made beforehand. The identification is followed by a model validation in which the performance and some characteristics of the model are as- sessed. All steps may be repeated in order to find the best model. A flowchart of the CFD/SI procedure is depicted in Figure 6.010. A priori acquired data from the step response simulation (cf. Section 6.01) and the discretization study (cf. Section 5.01) was used to aid the process in finding a suitable solver setup and model structure. Moreover, this information was employed in the validation process. 6.03.01 Data Preparation The acquired data were pre-processed for the SI. If the simulation had to be restarted, the data series were concatenated to form a single long time series for each variable. Depending on whether the full cylinder or only parts of it should be analyzed, the data of the individual sectors were combined as desired. All time series were recorded with variable time steps as the simulation was set to keep the CFL number constant to a specific maximum value (CFLmax ≤ 0.02). To achieve a constant sampling time, necessary for the identification procedure, the data were linearly interpolated to a constant sampling time step corresponding to the smallest time increment in the simulation. The PSD at frequencies associated with the smallest time step is low and hence the aliasing introduced by the interpolation is negligible. Subsequently, the data is filtered and down-sampled to a larger sampling time Ts. A general guideline to choose the Ts in practice is about 20 to 40 samples in one settling time cτ, where cτ is the dominant time constant or the time constant of a first order approximation of the system (Åström and Wittenmark, 1997, Chapter 2). For cτ = 0.02 (Lighthill, 1954), this leads to Ts = 0.0005 −0.001. In this thesis, Ts = 0.001309 was chosen, which yields a Nyquist frequency of Sr Nyquist = 240 six times higher than the frequency of interest. In the step response simulations, a rise time of cτ = 0.02378 for a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 40 was found. This result confirms the choice of sampling time. The down sampling procedure removes high-frequency noise from the interpola- tion and keeps only information necessary for the identification procedure. The choice of Sr max = 240 proved to yield the best results in the identification of OE models. The desired range of frequencies in terms of Strouhal number is 0≤ Sr ≤ 40, similar to Lighthill’ s study (Lighthill, 1954). If a transient process at the beginning of the time series was observed, this part was removed before further processing. At this point, it would have been possible to filter the time series further to enhance desirable properties or reduce contamination and therefore aid the identification 6 Transfer Function Identification excitation signal CFD simulations choose ident. method estimate parameters model validation model accepted discretization study start end solver setup CFD of step response and model structure yes no Figure 6.010: Flowchart of the CFD/SI Procedure. Adapted from Söderström and Stoica (cf. Figure 4.06). 6.03 CFD/SI process. Filtering the data series does not modify the transfer behavior itself, as long as both input and output are treated with the same filter. This does, however, not hold for the noise. For the transfer function identification, filtering is equivalent to weighting, but the filter changes the color of the noise and hence it is not recom- mended to use “pre-filtering”if a proper noise model is sought. In the next step, the normalized pulsations of the instantaneous Reynolds number, the Nußelt number, and the friction coefficient are determined by u Re(t) = Re(t) −Re Re, y Nu(t) = Nu(t) −Nu Nu, and yc f (t) = c f (t) −c f c f. (6.07) The quantities Re, Nu, and c f are the sample means of the according time series evaluated by φ = 1 N N∑︂ n=1 φ[n] (6.08) where φ stands for Re, Nu, and c f. The means served as estimates for Re 0, Nu 0, and c f,0 respectively. Finally, input and response data were split into two sets. A larger set, containing 80 % of the complete time series, was used to estimate the model (estimation set). The rest served as a validation set, which the model output was compared to as a test on “fresh” data (cross validation). The data for every mean flow Reynolds number was collected for a simulation time of more than t > 200, i.e. the free-stream passes the cylinder more than 200 times. Therefore, the estimation set had at least a length of 160 and the validation set at least a length of 40. The acquired time series are examined in more detail. Reynolds Number Time Series For the SI procedure, the time series of the input signal was acquired over a cross- sectional plane inside the simulation domain. This was done to ensure that any effect of the simulation tool, e.g. the implementation of the inlet boundary or of the numerical procedure, affected the signal in the least possible way. In other words: This ensured that the velocity actually acting on the cylinder is acquired, which equals not necessarily exactly the imposed input signal. Figure 6.011 a shows an excerpt of the time series acquired from the CFD simulation. The signal never exceeds the interval [ −0.005, 0.005]. This corresponds to the desired amplitude of the 5 % of the mean flow Reynolds number. Figure 6.011 b depicts Welch’ s estimate of the acquired input signal. The PSD is high at low frequencies and nearly constant between 0 ≤ Sr ≤ 40. The cutoff frequency, 6 Transfer Function Identification 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20−0.01 −0.005 0.005 0.01 t u Re (a) Excerpt of Input Time Series 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240−150 −100 −50 Sr PSD [d B] (b) PSD (Welch’ s Estimate) of Input Time Series −0.01 −0.0075 −0.005 −0.0025 0 0.0025 0.005 0.0075 0.010 u Re Frequency (c) Histogram of Input Time Series Figure 6.011: Input Time Series (Reynolds Number). Bars denote the bins of the input time series. A normal distribution with the same mean and stan- dard deviation as the data is indicated ( ). 6.03 CFD/SI where the PSD is 3 d B lower than the steady-state value, is around Sr = 60. This was also a design parameter for the input signal generation. Especially above Sr = 100, no significant power is contained in the acquired time series. The highest frequency that can be reconstructed from the signal is the Nyquist frequency Sr max = 240, which was determined by the down sampling. The histogram of the times series offers insight into the amplitude distribution of the data. Occurrences of values within a certain range (bin) are counted, and the final sums are shown in Figure 6.011 c. The excitation signal was generated by non- Gaussian simulation (sampling). Hence, the acquired Reynolds number fluctuation does not deviate too much from the amplitude distribution created with the tool by Föller and Polifke. It is almost uniform with a wave-like shape favoring positive values. The almost uniform distribution is advantageous for SI, because extreme values are reached comparably often, i.e. a good crest factor is achieved. Nußelt Number Time Series The Nußelt number was acquired as the time series comprising the output of the system. A similar procedure as for the input signal was applied to post-process the data. Figure 6.012 a shows an excerpt of the acquired relative Nußelt number fluctua- tion for all sectors combined. The same period of time as in Figure 6.011 a was chosen for comparison. The time series has less high amplitude peaks and also the general range is only in the range [−0.001, 0.0008] in this excerpt indicating the expected low- pass behavior. This tendency to respond weaker at higher frequencies can also be seen in the PSD as depicted in Figure 6.012 b. Within the frequency range of interest the PSD drops more than 20 d B in this case (Re 0 = 40). As expected, the cutoff frequency of the input signal is visible as a sudden drop in PSD at frequencies above Sr= 60. There is no significant PSD above Sr = 100. The amplitude distribution of the Nußelt number fluctuation in response to the ex- citation in Reynolds number is depicted in Figure 6.012 c. In comparison to a normal distribution with zero mean value and the same standard deviation,y Nu resembles a Gaussian distribution which may be explained through the Central Limit Theorem. Friction Coefficient Time Series The skin friction is quantified by the friction coefficient. Again, only the relative fluctuation yc f is considered for the SI procedure. The time series depicted in Fig- ure 6.013 a includes the same time range as in Figure 6.011 a and Figure 6.012 a.

A normal distribution with the same mean and stan- dard deviation as the data is indicated ( ). 6.03 CFD/SI relative amplitudes of up to 70 % can be detected which is a lot stronger than the 5 % of the excitation. Inspection of the PSD of the friction coefficient, as shown in Figure 6.013 b, reveals that the PSD rises with the frequency until the cutoff of the input signal is reached. Comparison with the PSD of the Reynolds number fluctuation indicates a high- pass behavior. It is to be expected that the amplitude would grow indefinitely with frequency. This is in accordance with the analysis of Stoke’ s second problem (cf. Section 3.01.02). It predicts the shear stress pulsations to grow with the square root of the Strouhal number Sr. However, at some frequency much higher than examined in this thesis, the assumption of incompressibility will cease to be valid. For the amplitude distribution of the friction coefficient pulsation, a similar shape as for the Nußelt number is acquired (Figure 6.013 c). However, the high-pass behav- ior does not force the amplitude distribution to be Gaussian as does the low-pass behavior of the heat transfer. Coherence of Input and Outputs The coherence of the input and the output signal (cf. Section 4.01.05) is an indicator for the linearity of the system. If excitation and response share a linear relationship, the coherence is close to unity. The coherence is also linked to the signal-to-noise ratio and hence shows at which frequencies a good model is to be expected. Figure 6.014 depicts the coherence between the Nußelt number pulsations and Reynolds num- ber pulsations as well as the coherence between the pulsation of the friction coef- ficient and the pulsation of the Reynolds number. For the first, the value is above 0.09 in the complete range of interest and almost unity in the range 5 ≤ Sr ≤ 70. At very low frequencies, coherence is not as high, which suggests a higher noise level. This can be attributed to the fact that the time series has finite length. It is therefore expected that models will show higher errors at these frequencies. Above Sr = 90, the PSD of the excitation is at the level of the disturbances and hence coherence is low, i.e. signal-to-noise ratio is low. This is reasonable considering the PSD of the excitation signal is also very low above this frequency. For the coherence between Reynolds number pulsation and skin friction pulsation, a very similar behavior is observed. Coherence is high in the frequency range of interest indicating, a linear relationship and a high signal-to-noise ratio. Again, like the coherence between Re′ and Nu′, at very low frequencies signal-to-noise ratio is not as high ( ∼ 0.08) and identified models are expected to be less accurate in this region. Beyond the cutoff frequency of the excitation, the coherence drops, but not as fast for the heat transfer. These higher coherence levels might be due to the high- pass nature of the skin friction. 6 Transfer Function Identification 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20−1 −0.05 0.05 t yc f (a) Excerpt of Time Series 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240−150 −100 −50 Sr PSD [d B] (b) PSD (Welch’ s Estimate) of Time Series −1 −0.075 −0.05 −0.025 0 0.025 0.05 0.075 10 yc f Frequency (c) Histogram of Time Series Figure 6.013: Output Time Series (Friction Coefficient).

From the inspection of the coherence, the following conclusions can be drawn: For both the Nußelt number Nu and the skin frictionc f at the given mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 and the given excitation amplitude A = 0.005 ·Re 0 the relationship to the Reynolds number fluctuation is fairly linear. The signal-to-noise ratio is high throughout the frequency range of interest, but slightly lower at very low frequen- cies and where the PSD of u Re is low. 6.03.02 Development of Discrete Time Models Model Structure and Parameter Estimation The problem at hand can be described as a SISO system, and the quantities of in- terest can be acquired directly from CFD data. No prior knowledge of the physics involved should be used, i.e. a black-box model is sought, so the model is not re- stricted in this regard. Therefore, it is most convenient to identify a model in input- output structure (cf. Section 4.03.02). For Re 0 = 40, laminar flow was assumed in the whole domain. No vortex shedding occurs even at the highest Reynolds number considered, and the routines for data extraction are not subject to “sensor noise”, as would be the case for most hardware sensors. This leads to the conclusion that the level of stochastic disturbance or noise in the system is low and most likely not strongly colored. Thus, as a model structure, an OE model as sketched in Figure 4.07 was chosen. 6 Transfer Function Identification For the identification, model orders nb and n f have to be chosen beforehand. The CFD simulation is a causal system, in which an instantaneous feed-through of veloc- ity perturbations exists. The Reynolds number fluctuation at the present time has to be taken into account, and no pole may be present at the origin in the transfer function. Thus, the model orders are constrained bynb = n f +1. A model providing the best estimate is sought, preferring models with lower orders. This was achieved with nb = 5 and n f = 4. Model Representations Different representations of the identified models are shown in the plots in Figure 6.015 to Figure 6.017 exemplary for Re 0 = 40. The SI procedure was the same for all mean flow Reynolds numbers. During parameter estimation (cf. Section 4.04.02), the coefficients of the B polynomial and the F polynomial yielding the smallest prediction error were calculated. A graphical representation of these parameters is given in Figure 6.015. Blue dots show the coefficient values. The 99 % confidence interval calculated during parameter estimation (cf. Section 4.04.03) is indicated by the area confided by red lines around zero. A parameter within this region would indicate that this parameter is not significantly different from zero and possibly point towards a too high model order. However, in the case of the model depicted in Figure 6.015, the confidence intervals are very narrow, and it may be concluded that all coefficients provide a significant contribution to the description of the system dynamics. As described in Section 4.01.03 and Section 4.03.03, the (unit) impulse response is an important representation. On the one hand, it facilitates physical interpretation of a process in the time domain. On the other hand, it is a simple and well-known model for linear systems. The impulse response of the identified OE model is depicted in Figure 6.016. The heat transfer responds instantly and strongly to an impulse in the velocity. The deviation from the mean Nußelt number continues at t > 0, although the impulse is already in the past, but decays to even slightly negative values before settling to zero at later times. A value of zero at infinite times is in accordance with the fact that the system is BIBO stable. Stability is required because the system is also stable, which can be deduced from the fact that a steady state exists (cf. Section 4.01.02). The response at time t = 0 is approximately half as strong as at the next instant t = Ts. This is due to the discretization in the discrete time framework and not present in a continuous time model. The impulse response indicates that the OE model is to be preferred over the simpler FIR model, as often used in conjunction with the CFD/SI method in the past, due to the slow changing dynamics with large time scales compared to the sampling time. For an FIR model, a huge number of coefficients would be necessary. This tends to be problematic without proper regularization techniques. 6.03 CFD/SI −4−3−2−10−0.004 −0.002 0.002 0.004 −4−3−2−10−6 −3 Figure 6.015: Identified Model Parameters of Polynomials B and F.

The unit circle is marked. The insert magnifies the region close to 1 +0 i The response of the heat transfer to a unit step in the flow velocity, also as depicted in Figure 6.016, is another time domain model (cf. Section 4.03.04). It can also be seen as the cumulative sum of all impulse responses up to a certain instant in time. Hence, no new information is acquired from the representation. However, it is possible to simulate the step response in a CFD simulation directly as shown in Section 6.01. This makes the step response an excellent tool to compare and to validate the SI procedure as shown in Section 6.01. It is, however, also limited as can be seen in the case of Re 0 = 3900 (cf. Section 6.03.05). The frequency response expresses the model behavior in the frequency domain. It quantifies the relation between input and output for a sinusoidal excitation at Strouhal number Sr. The complex-valued frequency response, depicted as a Bode plot with amplitude and phase of the complex-valued quantity, is reported for all identified models in Section 6.04. The coefficients of the OE model can be transformed to poles and zeros of the ra- tional function that is a mathematical representation of the OE model. They are shown in Figure 6.017 as crosses (poles) and circles (zeros). All poles are within the unit circle, which indicates that the discrete time model is BIBO stable. The poles are also very close to the unit circle, which is a sign of slowly varying dynamics. All poles (and zeros) are located on the real axis. Hence, no oscillating component (complex exponential) is introduced in the impulse response. 6.03 CFD/SI A pole–zero pair very close to the unit circle (cf. insert in Figure 6.017) indicates that a smaller model order might lead to similarly good results. Indeed, a smaller model order has proven to be sufficient at higher Reynolds numbers. At lower mean flow Reynolds numbers, a higher model order is necessary to capture the dynamics satisfactorily. The model order nb = 5 and n f = 4 was chosen here to be consistent with the models for other mean flow Reynolds numbers identified with the same procedure. 6.03.03 Development of Continuous Time Models Model Structure and Parameter Estimation As an alternative to the identification of a discrete time model like the OE model, the identification of continuous time models using Quad-VF was investigated. The best model fit was achieved using fourth-order polynomials for both the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. The time series prepared as detailed in Section 6.03.01 were used for the identification. The major difference to the iden- tification of an OE model is that the data was first transformed to the frequency domain using FFT. The FFT leads to data at evenly distributed frequencies. Working with frequency domain data offers some advantages: Weighting factors can easily be assigned to certain frequencies. At higher mean flow Reynolds numbers (Re 0 > 1), lower frequencies were emphasized to accurately reflect the peak gain. At lower mean flow Reynolds numbers, the weighting shifted towards higher frequencies. This supports an accurate identification, although amplitudes are very low due to the low-pass behavior. Any type of VF-related method is poorly conditioned if the order of the identified model becomes higher than twice the number of peaks present in the transfer func- tion. This can be controlled to some extent by regularization, i.e. using the CLS approach to relocate the poles during the identification procedure. Regularization achieves lower variance at the cost of bias. In the case of a comparatively high model order, a small regularization factor in the order of the floating-point relative accu- racy λ ≈ 1 ×10−15 for an L 2-regularization proved to drastically reduce the variance with a negligible effect on the identified parameters. Nonlinear parameter estimation methods are prone to become trapped in a local minimum and therefore rely on good initial conditions. Further improvement of the identification procedure could be achieved by successive identification of models with different mean flow Reynolds numbers using a predefined set of poles. The initial poles were taken from the model identified with a similar Reynolds number. In particular, the transfer function G(Re 0 = 40) was used as initial condition for G(Re 0 = 20) and so on. The mean flow Reynolds numbers were chosen in such a way that the changes from one model to the next were not too large.

The abscissa gives the exponent of the Laplace parameter s. Red lines mark the 99 %-confidence interval. tion of a single model is not an isolated event, but the complete set of data is used to support the process. The resulting models are rational functions of the Laplace- parameter s. Model Representations Exemplary for all identified models, the model representations for GNu(Re 0 = 40) are discussed in this section. The identified models are primarily represented by the model coefficients and the covariance matrix. Figure 6.018 shows the coefficients of the numerator and the denominator of the rational function that was used to model the transfer behavior. The variance of each parameter, the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix, is represented as the 99 % confidence intervals plotted in red. The abscissa indicates the power of the Laplace parameters in the transfer function. All parameters are significantly different from zero, and the presented model pro- vides the best fit to the given data. However, the parameter associated withs 4 in the numerator polynomial is very small. It can be set to zero with only a minor reduction of the model fit (< 1 %). This modification yields a model with |GNu| →0 for Sr → ∞ and is to be preferred if a well-behaved approximation of the real physics is valued over accuracy. 6.03 CFD/SI 0 0.05 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 4 4.05 5−0.02 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 1.02 1.04 1.06 1.08 t g (t), h(t) Figure 6.019: Impulse Response and Step Response of Transfer Function from VF. Impulse response ( ), step response ( ). The impulse response and the step response are continuous functions in the case of a continuous model. Both response representations are depicted in Figure 6.019. The graphs are very similar to that of the discrete time model except for the dis- cretization. The impulse response is strongest at t = 0 and declines in the shape of superimposed exponential functions. It becomes negative at t ≈ 1.06 and settles to zero for t → 0. Accordingly, the step response reaches its maximum at t ≈ 1.06 and the quasi steady-state limit is KNu = 0.04235. For a transfer function, usually given as a rational function, poles and zeros can easily be calculated. For the case at hand, they are shown in Figure 6.020. Zeros are represented by circles and poles by crosses. All poles are located in the left half plane. Hence, the continuous time model is BIBO stable. This condition is enforced during identification by pole flipping. All poles and zeros are real-valued and no complex- valued poles, which would occur as complex conjugate pairs, are present. This also shows that no oscillatory component is present in the impulse response. 6.03.04 Model Validation The model validation tests, introduced in Section 4.05, were performed for every identified model. Exemplary for all acceptable models, graphical representations of the validation are given for the identification procedure of the OE model for GNu(Re 0 = 40) (cf. Section 6.03.02). 6 Transfer Function Identification −1200 −1000 −800 −600 −400 −200 0−1 −0.08 −0.06 −0.04 −0.02 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Real Axis Imaginary Axis −3 −2 −1 0−1 Figure 6.020: Poles and Zeros of the Continuous Transfer Function.The insert mag- nifies the region close to the origin 0 +0 i. Residuals Basic test criteria focus on the residuals of the identification process. They cor- respond to the prediction errors, i.e. deviations of the modeled output to the “true”(CFD simulated) output. In Figure 6.021 a, an excerpt of the time series is de- picted. The same interval as in the plots for the input and output data is shown. The mean value is close to zero indicating that the model is unbiased. The residuals are in the range [−2.09 ×10−4, 2.09 ×10−4] which is small compared to the model output, i.e. the relative Nußelt number fluctuation ([−0.0014, 0.0014]). Welch’ s estimate for the PSD of the residuals is depicted in Figure 6.021 b. The noise has substantial PSD in the frequency range where also the excitation, hence the response, is strong and drops by several orders of magnitude around Sr= 80. At very low values of the Strouhal number, the PSD is higher because of the finite length of the time series. This is in accordance with the coherence of input and outputs (cf. Figure 6.014) which shows values below unity and can thus be attributed to higher noise levels, i.e. a lower signal-to-noise ratio. Around Sr ≈ 5 a local minimum is reached. At this point, length effects are negligible, and the output y Nu has a com- paratively high amplitude, and hence the prediction error minimization yields best results in this region. This can be seen as a natural weighting in the case of an OE model. In cases where a noise model was identified, i.e. a BJ model structure was chosen, the model for this PSD is used to find the optimal one-step ahead predictor. The VF approach does not rely on the minimization of the prediction error but on 6.03 CFD/SI 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 −2 ·10−4 t εNu (a) Excerpt of Time Series 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240−150 −100 −50 Sr PSD [d B] (b) PSD (Welch’ s Estimate) of Time Series −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 ·10−4 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 εNu Frequency (c) Histogram of Time Series Figure 6.021: Time Series of Residuals (Nußelt Number). Bars denote the bins of the input time series. A normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the data is indicated ( ). 6 Transfer Function Identification the smart relocation of poles. For this reason, no weighting occurs in this manner in the VF procedure and residuals are often larger. Figure 6.021 c shows the histogram, i.e. the amplitude distribution of the residuals for the model estimated for Re 0 = 40. A normal distribution derived from the sample mean and of the residual time series is included in Figure 6.021 c. It can be concluded by inspection that the residuals are close to normally distributed and hence the noise, which is equal to the prediction error in case of an OE model, has a Gaussian distribution. Figure 6.022 depicts the output y Nu and the residuals εNu as a scatter plot. Every instant in the time series is represented as one point. This plot can be used to detect patterns in the residuals and relations between residuals and output. The red dots mark the data of a model identified with a 5 % amplitude in excitation velocity. An excitation of 25 % was used to create the blue time series for comparison. The shape of the red cloud for the lower amplitude is elliptical with the principal axis aligned with the coordinates y Nu and εNu. This indicates that no systematic relationship between output and residuals is present. In the case of the higher amplitude, how- ever, the cloud exhibits a half moon shape. At extreme values of y Nu, the residual also exhibits extreme and always positive values. The positive values and the curved shape indicate a (slightly) nonlinear behavior that cannot be handled by the linear model and hence condenses in the residuals. It is also strongest at extreme values, which points towards a nonlinearity associated with the excitation amplitude. For all identification procedures reported in Section 6.03, an excitation amplitude of 5 % of the mean flow velocity was used. Correlation Tests Two correlation tests are commonly performed during model validation: a test for whiteness and a test for independence. Before the correlations were computed the according time series were down sampled to Sr max = 60. This way, the high- frequency noise did not appear in the correlation and the overall time covered by 20 samples, which is a typical number, is four times larger. In the whiteness test (cf. Section 4.05), the auto-correlation of the residuals was com- puted as shown in Figure 6.023. The two red lines mark the 99 % confidence interval. Correlation coefficients within the red lines are considered not significantly differ- ent from zero. The assumption of GWN is only proven true if the auto-correlation is insignificant for every lag > 0. This is a condition hardly achieved with an OE model structure as it was in this case. However, due to the independent parametrization of the deterministic part and the noise (which is not modeled at all), this has no impact on the deterministic model. 6.03 CFD/SI −0.008 −0.006 −0.004 −0.002 0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008−3 −2 −1 ·10−3 y Nu εNu Figure 6.022: Scatter Plot of Residuals and Output.

Cross-correlation function of residuals and in- put.The 99 % confidence interval is indicated by red lines ( ). The second correlation test is between the residuals and the input. If the cross- correlation between residuals and input is not significant, both time series are independent (cf. Section 4.05). This means that no information in the residuals is related to past inputs and hence all information is contained in the model output. Figure 6.024 depicts the cross-correlation between residuals of the identification of GNu(Re 0 = 40) and the input signal used in the estimation. The 99 % confidence intervals are shown in red. There is no significant correlation at negative lags which would indicate feedback of any kind. A noticeable correlation is visible at lags 0, 1, and 2. They are associated with high frequencies and are insignificant if the time series for identification are pre-filtered with a low-pass filter, i.e. the high-frequency content is reduced beforehand. Cross-Validation The most important test is probably the cross-validation test. A “fresh” data set, of which input and output are known, was compared to the model response to the input provided by this validation set. This test is only applicable in this manner with high signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. in cases where stochastic disturbances have only little effect on the output. A validation time series is created for every data set, i.e. for ev- ery mean flow Reynolds number, by splitting the acquired time series into two parts. The second, much shorter part (20 % of the full time series length) is solely used for the cross-validation. Figure 6.025 shows an excerpt of the CFD simulated output. For comparison, the response computed with the model is plotted on top. The lines 6.03 CFD/SI 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10−0.0015 −0.001 −0.0005 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 Figure 6.025: Excerpt of Time Series for Comparison. Time series from CFD simula- tion ( ) and time series from OE model ( ). match very well for this case. The goodness of fit is quantified by the NRMSE-fit. The fit values for all identified models are given in Table 6.03 for the heat transfer and in Table 6.05 for the skin friction. For the continuous time identification, models and fits are reported in the appendix. All fit values are above 95 % (except for Re 0 = 1, which has Φ = 94 %) and hence perform excellently in the cross-validation test. 6.03.05 Identification in the Presence of Tonal Noise and Turbulence Vortex shedding creates a tonal noise at a distinct frequency (twice the vortex shed- ding frequency). In this case, the noise cannot be assumed white but is strongly colored, which impedes identification. Moreover, turbulence creates broadband disturbances with a characteristic spectrum (cf. Section 2.01.03). Several measures can be taken to remedy this problem. Tonal Noise The influence of the vortex shedding on heat transfer and skin friction is part of the noise. As the vortex shedding occurs at a distinct frequency, the contribution to the noise is tonal. The response to vortex shedding must not be included in the deterministic model for two reasons: First, it is not a response to the input signal but also exists in the (quasi) steady state. Second, the linearity requirement is not fulfilled as the strength of the vortex shedding depends on the mean flow and not 6 Transfer Function Identification on the excitation. The later also is detectable in the coherence between input and output. Turbulent Noise Disturbances in the heat transfer and the skin friction are caused by turbulent fluc- tuations of the flow velocity. Turbulence is by nature three dimensional, chaotic, and highly transient. It is independent of the input signal and hence clearly part of the system noise. Measuring the Reynolds number with an area average over a plane diminishes the effect of turbulence on the acquired input signal. However, the effect of turbulent structures on the heat transfer and the skin friction can only be factored out partially by calculating average values for the Nußelt number Nu and the friction coefficient c f. It is possible to identify unbiased purely deterministic models in the presence of turbulence if the length of the time series is sufficient. In many cases, it may not be possible to acquire time series long enough through simulation. The model of choice is then the BJ model with independent parametrization for the deterministic part and the disturbances. Approaches to Signal Processing Due to the tonal nature of the vortex shedding influence, any deterministic model will include this effect if the model order is high enough to represent it. This results in three fundamental approaches: (1) removing the tonal noise from the response during pre-processing before parameter estimation, (2) choose a small model order so the strongly bandlimited effect cannot be represented, or (3) identify a noise model that includes this effect. For a wide range of Reynolds numbers, the vortex shedding Strouhal number is Srf ≈ 0.02, evaluated with frequency f = ω/(2π). For smaller Re 0, it is somewhat below this value. Due to symmetry, the frequency of the tonal disturbance is twice the shedding frequency. Using the angular frequency to define the Strouhal number, as it is done throughout this thesis, yields Sr ≈ 2.05. The vortex shedding phenomenon occurs for mean flow Reynolds numbers of Re 0 & 47. Hence, the investigated mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900 exhibit this periodical detaching of the recirculation zones. At Re 0 = 120, the fluctuation in Nußelt number Nu is not as strong and can be compensated with a high signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. higher excitation amplitudes. This is not possible for higher Reynold numbers, because the strength of the tonal noise is comparable to the limit of linearity. 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification Tangirala 1 proposed to transform the output signal using FFT, and reduce the co- efficient associated with the vortex shedding frequency. Subsequently, the signal is transformed back to time domain (using inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT). This approach does not lead to satisfactory results, because complete removal of the vortex shedding frequency, i.e. setting the FFT coefficient to zero, also leads to distortion at this frequency. A notch filter with a very small stopband was used as another method to remove the tonal noise component. This is equivalent to factor in the vortex shedding frequency with only a small weight. The notch filter, however, is difficult to set up. A narrow fil- ter width greatly diminishes one specific frequency but does not necessarily capture the effect of the vortex shedding satisfactorily. On the other hand, if the filter width is too broad, this influences the low frequencies to a large extent and does not yield acceptable results either. Approaches (2) and (3) were used in combination for the identification of the mod- els at Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900. A low-order for the deterministic model was chosen in conjunction with a high order of the noise model to successfully de- termine the transfer behavior. System Identification with Noise Modeling For the transfer function identification from LES data, a BJ model structure (cf. Sec- tion 4.04.04) was chosen. The BJ model is similar to the OE model with the addition of a parametrization for the noise. This increase in model complexity is necessary to deal with the two phenomena vortex shedding and turbulence. A fitting of the deterministic model to the noise dynamics has to be avoided. This is especially critical in the case of the tonal noise from vortex shedding. To achieve this, a low deterministic model order is complemented by a high order for the noise model. The time series data was prepared in the same way as for the identification from laminar simulations (cf. Section 6.03.01). 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification In this section, the results from the identification processes are shown. The mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 serves as a parameter. A transfer function for the heat transfer and the skin friction of a cylinder to pulsations in the flow velocity for every mean flow Reynolds number considered in this thesis was identified. The estimated coefficients of the transfer functions were tabulated. The frequency responses are 1 Private communication, 2014 6 Transfer Function Identification shown as Bode plots to give a graphical representation of the dynamic behavior and the differences between the models evaluated at different mean flow Reynolds numbers. The results reported here were previously published in parts in Witte et al (2016 a,b); Witte and Polifke (2017 a). The models identified with discrete time identification techniques, OE model or BJ model, are reported here. For mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ≤ 40, it was possible to calculate transfer functions with three substantially different methods. The only commonality was that the data was acquired from numerical simulations solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. All methods, the step response simulations, the LNSE approach and the CFD/SI method lead to results with only minor differences. Two different approaches to SI, one for discrete time and one for continuous time, were examined and the results also match within a small margin. For completeness, these models are reported in the appendix. The coefficients of the transfer function were determined through parameter esti- mation during the identification process. In the discrete time framework, the mod- els depend on the sampling time. To achieve independence from this discretization, the discrete time models were transformed to continuous time using bilinear trans- form (cf. Equation (4.023)). The original sampling time was short enough so that the transformation has a negligible effect on the frequency response in the range 0 ≤ Sr ≤ 40. {bm} and { an} denote the model coefficients in continuous time. The general transfer function model, given as a rational function of the Laplace parame- ter s = σ+i Sr (cf. Equation (4.024)), can be written as G(s) = b 0 +b 1 s +b 2 s 2 +b 3 s 3 +b 4 s 4 1 +a 1 s +a 2 s 2 +a 3 s 3 +a 4 s 4. (6.09) The coefficients are reported for all mean flow Reynolds numbers under considera- tion in Table 6.04 and Table 6.06. The BJ models for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re > 40 can be written as y =G(q)u Re +H(q)e[k]. (6.010) The deterministic models were transformed to a continuous time transfer function by bilinear transform. These transfer functions for heat transfer and skin friction are also reported in Table 6.04 and Table 6.06, respectively. 6.04.01 Heat Transfer The dynamic behavior of the heat transfer of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow at different mean flow Reynolds numbers is reported as transfer functions and visu- alized as Bode plots of the frequency response. These results have previously been published in parts by Witte and Polifke (2017 a). 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification Re 0 Φ in % Estimation Cross-validation 0.01 96.011 97.094 0.02 95.050 97.030 0.04 93.089 98.031 0.05 94.062 97.005 0.07 93.039 95.058 1.00 90.017 94.054 2.00 93.085 95.066 3.00 94.046 96.018 4.00 96.016 97.006 10.00 98.033 99.007 20.00 94.073 99.025 40.00 98.064 98.069 120 99.099 240 99.099 3900 99.093 Table 6.03: NRMSE-Fit of the Identified Transfer Functions of Heat Transfer. Transfer Functions The transfer functions are transformed OE models or BJ models identified from CFD data. The goodness of fit achieved during estimation and the goodness of fit from the cross-validation test are reported in Table 6.03. For models with a mean flow Reynolds number above the threshold for vortex shedding Re 0 > 40, for which also a noise model was identified, almost perfect fit values during estimation were achieved. This is due to the high order noise model with ten coefficients for each of the two polynomials. The computation of an infinite-step ahead prediction for cross-validation was not useful due to the strong unpredictable noise content in the data. Table 6.04 gives the coefficients transformed to continuous time to acquire inde- pendence of the sampling time. For every mean flow Reynolds number Re 0, two rows are noted in the table. One for the numerator coefficients {bn} and one for the denominator coefficients { am}. Each column stands for one power of the Laplace parameter. The first row of coefficients includes the constant terms which are equal to the steady state limit of the transfer function b 0 = KNu. The constant coefficient of the denominator polynomial is always one and therefore omitted. For mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ≤ 40, five coefficients for the numerator nn = 5 and four coefficients for the denominatornm = 4 have been estimated and hence the highest power is s 4. 6 Transfer Function Identification Re 0 s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 0.01 b 0.02015 1.0893 1.0739 0.01407 0.0000241 6 a 31.07 132.03 64.085 2.0338 0.02 b 0.02193 1.0683 1.0324 0.009926 1.078 ×10−4 a 20.058 66.025 27.053 0.0975 0.04 b 0.02561 1.0228 0.07184 0.004635 8.0009 ×10−5 a 11.098 25.01 7.098 0.0263 0.05 b 0.02648 0.08961 0.03885 0.002026 2.0629 ×10−5 a 9.0102 13.096 3.0382 0.0094 05 0.07 b 0.02806 0.06385 0.019 0.0007419 6.0163 ×10−6 a 6.0483 6.0814 1.0168 0.0025 86 1.00 b 0.02921 0.05471 0.01495 0.0005533 3.061 ×10−6 a 4.091 4.0364 0.06943 0.0014 99 2.00 b 0.03342 99.076 74.039 5.0545 0.0008733 a 300.03 739.03 259.03 10.062 3.00 b 0.03537 5.0543 3.0167 0.01983 2.0164 ×10−4 a 16.045 28.06 8.0078 0.02952 4.00 b 0.03662 2.0846 1.0895 0.01821 3.0881 ×10−4 a 8.0392 13.013 4.0508 0.02586 10.00 b 0.03949 4.0153 1.0265 0.004329 −9.0961 ×10−6 a 9.0869 8.0916 1.0481 0.0034 82 20.00 b 0.04145 3.0221 0.05823 0.001029 −1.0141 ×10−5 a 7.0007 4.028 0.04704 0.0006 289 40.00 b 0.04181 8.0033 18 0.08508 −8.0151 ×10−4 a 17.013 39.037 13.073 0.04533 120.00 b 0.04484 1.0506 ×10−4 −2.0696 ×10−7 a 0.02331 1.0081 ×10−5 240.00 b 0.0538 0.07906 −0.0001 383 a 2.0602 0.04011 3900.00 b 0.0538 0.0001 374 −2.0908 ×10−6 a 0.04887 3.0363 ×10−4 Table 6.04: Estimated Coefficients of the Transfer Function of Heat Transfer.All val- ues are transformed to continuous time using bilinear transform. 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 400 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 Sr |GNu| 0 0.05 1 1.05 20.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 higher Re 0 Figure 6.026: Amplitude of the Heat Transfer Frequency Response (Re 0 ≤ 40).

Frequency Response at Re 0 ≤ 40 The frequency response, as a representation of the transfer function, shows the response to continuous forcing of sine waves with a certain Strouhal number and a constant amplitude. Special attention is given to mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ≤ 40. This is the relevant range for the applications motivating this thesis, i.e. first and foremost the Rijke tube (cf. Table 3.01). The amplitude of the frequency response depicted in Figure 6.026 shows a low-pass behavior. The response is below unity throughout all frequencies, yet high frequen- cies are damped more strongly. This effect is more pronounced at lower Reynolds numbers. In terms of filters, the cutoff frequency is higher for higher mean flow Reynolds numbers. The amplitude at zero frequency Sr → 0 is the steady-state gain KNu also obtained through analysis of the step response (cf. Section 6.01.01 and Section 6.05.02). Again, a dependence on Reynolds number is evident and higher Reynolds number flow achieves greater gain values. The insert in Figure 6.026 magnifies the region of small Strouhal numbers in the range of 0 < Sr < 2, i.e. at low frequencies. For Reynolds numbers of order unity or larger, a peak in amplitude can be found in 0 < Sr < 1, which is also in agree- ment with the results of the step response simulations.

Figure 6.027 shows the phase difference between normalized velocity and heat re- lease rate fluctuations. For all Reynolds numbers, the phase starts at zero but shows a dependence on Reynolds number similar to the amplitude at Sr> 0. In general for all mean flow Reynolds numbers, there is a strong initial decay at low frequencies that becomes less steep towards higher Sr. If the mean flow Reynolds number is lower, the descent is steeper at low frequencies and more flat-angled towards higher Sr. At intermediate mean flow Reynolds numbers (10. Re 0. 40), slightly positive values (phase lead) occur at Strouhal numbers below 0.05. This effect was already predicted by Lighthill, but his solution approach was not able quantify it. The insert in Figure 6.027 magnifies the values at very low Sr where this phase lead occurs. For higher frequencies, phase values approach a value slightly larger than −π/2 for Sr → ∞. The theoretical high frequency limit for a first order system lim Sr→∞ ∠G = −π/2 in never reached. This is due to the flow field at the lee side of the cylinder, which could not be accounted for by the analytical investigations. In the step re- sponse in Figure 6.02, sector 4 assumes negative values leading to phase values of π, but with only a small contribution to the overall heat transfer. In the representation of the temperature fields (e.g. Figure 7.06 and Figure 7.017), this can be seen as hot zones close to the backward stagnation point of the cylinder. For the lowest mean 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠GNu Figure 6.028: Frequency Response of the Heat Transfer (Re 0 > 40).

The cross shows the low frequency limit evaluated from the correlation by Sparrow et al. flow Reynolds numbers, the initial drop in heat transfer rate at sector 4 is even stronger than the increase in sector 1 through sector 3. This is the reason for the phase to have a local minimum at Sr< 40 and rise again towards higher frequencies. For all mean flow Reynolds numbers, the phase lags coincide at a frequency close to Sr ≈ 7 with a value of about −π/3. The flow fields at this coincidence were inspected in Section 7.03.02, but no immediate cause could be found. Frequency Response at Re > 40 The frequency response of the identified deterministic models for Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900 is shown in Figure 6.028. The estimated 99 % confidence intervals are represented by dashed lines. The cross sign on the y-axis marks the theoretical low frequency limit evaluated using the correlation by Sparrow et al. The steady-state gain is higher than in the case of Re 0 = 40 as predicted by the correlation, but no peak occurs at low frequencies. Also, no phase lead is visible and the high frequency limit is higher than in the laminar cases. No clear trend concerning the steepness of the initial decay can be made out, but the decay at Re 0 = 3900 is clearly stronger that at Re 0 = 40. All steady-state values deduced from the correlation are within the 99 % confidence 6 Transfer Function Identification 0.001 0.01 1 10 100 240−100 −80 −60 −40 −20 -5/3 Sr Power Spectrum [d B] Figure 6.029: Noise Spectrum of Heat Transfer Pulsations (Re > 40).Re 0 = 120 ( ), Re 0 = 240 ( ), and Re 0 = 3900 ( ). The −5/3 slope is depicted to facilitate comparison with the turbulent inertial range. intervals of the respective frequency response except for Re 0 = 120. This is in accor- dance with the behavior of the phase. At low frequencies, two impeding effects accumulate. The estimate is less accurate because the finite length of the time series and the vortex shedding, which occurs around Sr ≈ 2.04 represents strong tonal noise. For this reason, the results have to be interpreted with care. The BJ model includes a parametrization for the noise. The spectrum of the iden- tified noise model |H(Sr)|2 is given in Figure 6.029 for Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900. At the lowest mean flow Reynolds number shown in this figure, the vortex shedding frequency is visible as a strong and sharp peak. At Re 0 = 240, this peak is broader and it is only visible as a hump at Re 0 = 3900. Moreover, the peak frequency is shifted to higher Strouhal numbers with higher mean flow Reynolds number, which is in accordance with observations reported in literature. For comparison with the spectrum of turbulence (cf. Section 2.01.03 and Figure 2.08), a line with slope −5/3 representing the turbulent cascade process (inertial range) is included. Besides the vortex shedding effect, a second and very weak deviation occurs at Sr ≈ 8 and Re 0 = 3900. This is approximately the frequency of Kelvin– Helmholtz instabilities in the free shear layer of the vortices. The exact frequency was determined by Lehmkuhl et al to Sr KH = 8.042 at Re 0 = 3900. 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification Re 0 Φ in % Estimation Cross-validation 0.01 98.085 99.062 0.02 98.070 99.065 0.04 98.066 99.060 0.05 99.057 99.055 0.07 98.052 99.037 1.00 98.067 99.016 2.00 98.069 99.030 3.00 98.064 99.043 4.00 99.050 99.049 10.00 98.073 99.059 20.00 98.052 98.085 40.00 98.052 99.056 120 91.048 240 75.062 3900 48.033 Table 6.05: NRMSE-Fit of the Identified Transfer Functions of Skin Friction.CFD/SI method with OE model (Re 0 ≤ 40) or BJ model (Re 0 > 40). For the validation of the results, the correlation tests were performed as shown for Re 0 = 40 in Section 6.03.04. It was not possible to perform a meaningful cross- validation test due to the strong unpredictable noise content. However, it is possible to refer to a priori known data like the low frequency limit evaluated from the steady- state correlation by Sparrow et al. 6.04.02 Skin Friction The skin friction is processed and reported in a way similar to the heat transfer. The results have in parts been published previously (Witte and Polifke, 2015, 2016). Transfer Functions The transfer functions are transformed OE models identified from CFD data. The goodness of fit that was achieved during estimation and the goodness of fit from the cross-validation test is reported in Table 6.05. At mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ≤ 40, fit values achieved during estimation and in comparison to the validation data set are always Φ > 98 %. The identification of 6 Transfer Function Identification the BJ for Re 0 > 40 was performed with more weight on the lower frequencies. This achieves a better fit at lower frequencies, which are underrepresented due to the high-pass behavior of the skin friction, and the low-frequency limit is closer to its theoretical prediction. However, this is at the cost of higher frequencies. Because of the high amplitudes, small deviations at high frequencies lead to large prediction errors. Hence, fit values are considerably worse for the BJ models, although low- frequency limits are more realistic. All identified transfer functions using OE model structure had five coefficients in the numerator and four coefficients in the denominator to represent the data accurately. At a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 > 40, BJ models were identified to cope with the tonal and turbulent noise. Table 6.06 gives the coefficients identified as an OE model and transformed to continuous time using bilinear transform. This table can be read like Table 6.04. Frequency Response at Re 0 ≤ 40 The frequency response of the skin friction is depicted in a manner similar to the heat transfer. Figure 6.030 shows the amplitude of the complex-valued frequency response. The region of low frequencies Sr ≤ 2 is magnified in the insert on the bottom right. The low frequency values are close to the predicted steady-state gain of 3/2 (Lighthill, 1954). If the mean flow Reynolds number is higher, also the quasi steady-state value is higher. Towards larger values of Strouhal number, a rise in am- plitude can be seen in a manner of a square root dependence as predicted by Stokes (cf. Section 3.01.02). A strong dependence on amplitude is visible throughout the whole range of Strouhal numbers. At the highest Strouhal number under con- sideration Sr = 40, the amplitude at Re 0 = 40 (|Gc f | =11.08) is approximately twice as high as at Re 0 = 0.01 (|Gc f | =5.088). Figure 6.031 depicts the phase between free-stream velocity pulsations and skin fric- tion pulsations. Mean flow Reynolds number from Re 0 = 0.01 (blue) to Re 0 = 40 (red) are shown. The phase difference in the limit Sr → 0 is zero, like in the case of the transfer function of the heat transfer. Phase values rise towards a phase lead of ∠Gc f = π/4 in the limit of high Strouhal numbers. No clear dependence on mean flow Reynolds number is visible for the initial rise starting from Sr = 0. At about Sr ≈ 0.05, the lowest Reynolds numbers depart from the initial inclination and satu- rate. This saturation occurs later for higher mean flow Reynolds numbers. At Sr= 40, the highest Strouhal number considered in this thesis, the phase of the frequency response shows a sequential order. The response of the Re 0 = 0.01 case is substan- tially below ∠Gc f = π/4, where the response at Re 0 = 40 has almost reached the theoretical limit. 6.04 Results from Transfer Function Identification Re s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 0.01 b 1.027 2.0253 0.04837 0.0018 82 0.0000 104 4 a 1.0024 0.0121 0.0002304 4.0499 ×10−6 0.02 b 1.0329 2.0333 0.05046 0.0019 91 0.0000 116 1 a 0.09694 0.01128 0.0002164 4.0276 ×10−6 0.04 b 1.0388 2.0302 0.04959 0.0019 66 0.0000 118 3 a 0.08886 0.01002 0.0001891 3.045 ×10−6 0.05 b 1.0416 2.021 0.04555 0.00173 9.0892 ×10−5 a 0.0823 0.0087 67 0.0001565 2.0519 ×10−6 0.07 b 1.0397 2.0292 0.05041 0.0020 52 0.0000 129 6 a 0.08502 0.0095 46 0.000182 3.0297 ×10−6 1.00 b 1.0375 2.0292 0.05066 0.0020 43 0.0000 125 8 a 0.08323 0.0091 32 0.000169 2.0817 ×10−6 2.00 b 1.0426 2.0173 0.04668 0.0018 63 0.0000 114 3 a 0.07432 0.0077 02 0.0001385 2.0246 ×10−6 3.00 b 1.0474 2.0086 0.04361 0.0017 17 0.0000 104 6 a 0.06885 0.0068 66 0.0001209 1.0938 ×10−6 4.00 b 1.0521 1.0997 0.03903 0.0014 52 8.0313 ×10−5 a 0.06289 0.0058 42 9.0684 ×10−4 1.0403 ×10−6 10.00 b 1.0581 2.0048 0.04231 0.0016 96 0.0000 101 5 a 0.06283 0.0061 24 0.0001067 1.0334 ×10−6 20.00 b 1.0571 2.0387 0.0604 0.0030 16 0.0000 238 9 a 0.07755 0.0093 58 0.0002061 4.0379 ×10−6 40.00 b 1.0659 2.0249 0.04783 0.0020 07 0.0000 128 9 a 0.06448 0.0064 32 0.0001177 1.0739 ×10−6 120.00 b 1.0659 1.0029 0.0038 55 a 0.01575 0.0001 384 240.00 b 1.0528 1.0044 0.0042 15 a 0.01759 0.0001 641 3900.00 b 1.0197 1.013 0.0053 15 a 0.01986 0.0002 823 Table 6.06: Estimated Coefficients of the Transfer Function of Skin Friction.All val- ues are transformed to continuous time using bilinear transform. 6 Transfer Function Identification 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 400 Sr |Gc f | 0 0.05 1 1.05 21 1.05 2.05 Figure 6.030: Amplitude of Skin Friction Frequency Response.Blue to red.

Frequency Response at Re > 40 The frequency responses of skin friction to pulsations in the free-stream velocity for Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900 are depicted in Figure 6.032. The responses of these identified deterministic models are very similar to the Re 0 = 40 case (cf. Figure 6.030 and Figure 6.031). The estimated 99 % confidence intervals are shown as dashed lines. They are much larger than in the case of the laminar models, especially at Re 0 = 3900. This is due to turbulent disturbances and the fact that higher number of coefficients was estimated because of the noise model. The low frequency limit of 3/2 for the amplitude (Lighthill, 1954) is underpredicted in the case of Re 0 = 3900 and overpredicted for Re 0 = 120 and Re 0 = 240. These deviations could be due to the low-order of the deterministic model. The amplitude rises almost linearly with frequency and all three modes do not show substantial differences. At the highest Strouhal number under consideration Sr= 40, the ampli- tude is approximately |Gc f | ≈11 for all models. The phase of the frequency responses shows a steep rise towards the limit of∠Gc f ≈ π/4 at high frequencies. The rise is steeper at higher mean flow Reynolds numbers. At Re 0 = 3900, a slight overshoot is visible.

The −5/3 slope is depicted to facilitate comparison with the turbulent inertial range. dence intervals are still within the limit and the overshoot may be attributed to the low-order of the deterministic model. In the model noise spectrum, shown in Figure 6.033, a similar behavior as for the heat transfer model is visible. General noise levels are higher due to the weighting in favor of low frequencies. The spectrum was modeled with seven coefficients for the numerator polynomial and denominator polynomial for Re 0 = 120, Re 0 = 240, and Re 0 = 3900. Again, the −5/3 slope is shown to establish the connection to the turbulent energy spectrum. Indeed, the power spectrum of the noise closely resem- bles the turbulent spectrum for Re 0 = 3900. The peak associated with vortex shedding is much more pronounced at Re 0 = 3900 than for the heat transfer. For Re 0 = 120, this effect is reversed and no peak is visible at the vortex shedding Strouhal number, where a clear maximum was visible in Fig- ure 6.029. No distinct deviation is visible at the frequency of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. A small peak at Sr ≈ 60 occurs due to perturbations in the excitation signal which has its cutoff frequency at this value. 6.05 Discussion 6.05 Discussion 6.05.01 Identification Method Three different methods were used to develop transfer functions of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. The first used the time series from the response to a step excitation. The step excitation is an important step for preliminary assessment before more complex methods are used. Nevertheless, it is possible to develop a transfer function under certain conditions. Following this path proved to be successful for Re 0 ≤ 40. The second method reported in this chapter was processed the frequency response data from the LNSE simulations. The identification of a continuous time transfer function from the acquired data yields results with a very good fit to the raw data. The identification requires only a small amount of data preparation. Together with the efficiency of the (incompressible) LNSE approach, this is the quickest way to de- velop transfer functions for Re 0 ≤ 40. However, this approach, like the step response method, fails to deliver acceptable results when vortex shedding occurs due to the fact that a true steady-state solution is required. Using a time or cycle average in- stead of a steady-state solution might be possible together with further adjustments, but no acceptable results could be achieved in due time. The CFD/SI method, was the third method. It used time domain data generated with broadband excitation and subsequently, a transfer function was developed. Two different identification approaches were considered. Continuous time identification uses the time domain data transformed into fre- quency space to directly develop a continuous time transfer function. The identi- fication method is basically the same as in the LNSE approach, but the frequency domain data, acquired using FFT, is not as good-natured as the frequency response data from the LNSE. The results showed the best agreement with the simulated data in cross-validation tests for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ≤ 40. The VF identifi- cation method can be used on data with Re 0 > 40, i.e. data contaminated by tonal or turbulent noise. However, noise in discrete time domain data cannot be handled by the VF approach, and hence it competes with the OE model identification but yields inferior results compared to a BJ model in the presence of intense or strongly colored disturbances. Discrete time identification in the framework of the CFD/SI approach proved to be the most versatile method. The identification of OE models from time domain data yielded excellent results. The time series acquired from a CFD simulation with broadband excitation can be used directly with very little pre-processing (resam- pling and linearization). Theoretically, the OE model identification can find the transfer function of the deterministic part even in the presence of higher noise 6 Transfer Function Identification levels. Transformation to a continuous time transfer function is facilitated through bilinear transform. The BJ model is an OE model with parametrization of the noise and, hence, basically an extension when noise handling, e.g. in the cases with Re 0 > 40, is necessary. Step excitation and simulation in the frequency domain are unsuited to develop transfer functions in the presence of tonal or broadband noise. The excitation of the system with only one single step, which is superimposed by disturbances, is not enough to separate the deterministic response from the stochastic noise. Hence, the true step response cannot be inferred like in the case of laminar flow (cf. Sec- tion 6.01). This was also shown by Cabrera for the case of Re 0 = 3900. Moreover, a single step excitation is also only of limited avail in determining step response characteristics like steady-state gain, rise time, and overshoot (cf. Section 6.01.03). Similar reasoning holds for tonal noise. No technique exists to distinguish between an overshoot or oscillations of the step response and the sinusoidal disturbance of the tonal noise. A clear distinction between deterministic system and noise would only be possible if several steps are used and the noise contribution cancels to zero across all steps due to its nature. This already leads to the principle of persistent excitation which is the idea behind broadband excitation in conjunction with SI. In the scope of tonal noise or turbulent noise, the LNSE approach is an interesting method. Both tonal noise originating from vortex shedding and broadband noise from turbulence are transient phenomena. To be represented in the model, these effects have to be included in the solution the linearization is based upon, i.e. the “steady-state” solution. Hence, instead of a true steady-state solution, which can only be found for Re 0.40, an averaged solution may be computed. In the presence of tonal noise, a cycle-average may be used at this point. This would allow simulat- ing a frequency response giving credit to the noise through the averaged solution. A transfer function can be identified from this response at discrete frequencies with- out a noise model. However, in the case of the flow around a cylinder, it was not possible to compute an averaged solution that allowed for a stable solution of the linearized equations. Some stabilization technique might represent a remedy for this numerical instability, but it was not within the scope of this thesis. Moreover, in order to treat turbulent flow with this method, the LNSE solver would have to be extended to three spatial dimensions and probably a model for the turbulence. To conclude the capabilities of each identification method in the presence of tonal or broadband noise, only OE, BJ, and the VF method remain. BJ is suited best be- cause of the possibility to combine a low order model for the deterministic transfer function with a noise model of rather high order that is able to reproduce the char- acteristics of the tonal noise or broadband noise. 6.05 Discussion 6.05.02 Heat Transfer For the heat transfer, several empirical and analytical results have been reported in the literature. The analytical results by Lighthill and Bayly can be com- pared to the transfer functions identified in this thesis. Moreover, the steady-state heat transfer correlations, e.g. by Collis and Williams as well as Sparrow et al, can be used to deduce the response amplitude in the limit of zero frequency, i.e. the steady-state gain K. Frequency Response Lighthill presented a model for heat transfer fluctuations at comparatively high mean flow Reynolds numbers (Re > 10). At such Reynolds numbers, most of the heat transfer takes place close to the forward stagnation point, so only the HL is considered. The model is detailed in Section 3.02.02 and the frequency response is shown in Figure 3.04. Bayly gives an expression for the unsteady heat trans- fer at low Péclet numbers for the whole cylinder. The derivation of the model is sketched in Section 3.03.02 and the frequency response is depicted in Figure 3.09. A comparison between the models identified in this thesis and analytical results was given by Witte and Polifke. Lighthill’ s and Bayly’ s models are represented in Figure 6.034 and Figure 6.035 as dashed lines and dash dotted lines, respectively. Figure 6.034 depicts the amplitude and the phase is shown in Figure 6.035. Solid lines denote models for Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40 identified in this thesis. The figures depict amplitude and phase of the frequency response of heat transfer fluctuations to velocity perturba- tions. As already reported by the respective authors, the analytical models have limited ap- plicability in the range 0.01≤ Re 0 ≤ 40. Bayly’ s model matches well with the identified frequency response at low Reynolds numbers. The relation given by Bayly yields fair results up to Re = 0.01 (as shown in the figure as dashed lines) but should not be used for mean flow Reynolds numbers above Re= 0.05. Lighthill stated that his model is applicable if a laminar boundary layer exists and gave Re > 10 as a limit. This is due to the fact that the boundary layer equations used by Lighthill make use of the limiting process Re → ∞. Indeed, the iden- tified frequency response at Re 0 = 40 shows very similar low and high-frequency limits in the amplitude. Lighthill’ s time constant cτ = 0.02, however, is considerably smaller than the dominant time scale in the Re 0 = 40 case from SI (cτ ≈ 0.03). This is due to the fact that only certain types of flow geometries can be handled analytically with the boundary layer equations.

The assump- tion that most of the heat transfer occurs close to the forward stagnation point, as stated by Lighthill, is also a very coarse approximation slightly better at higher mean flow Reynolds numbers. On the one hand, the good match to frequency responses reported in the litera- ture confirms the quality of the results from SI. On the other hand, a substantial improvement in accuracy was achieved. A wide range of Reynolds numbers and Strouhal numbers was covered, and the, as well as the behavior in the limit of very low and very high frequencies, was determined in superior detail. The most sub- stantial improvement is the dependence on mean flow Reynolds number, which was determined with the CFD data based methods for a great range and and very accurately. Low Frequency Limit The low frequency limit KNu serves two purposes in this work. Firstly, this quasi- steady-state gain may be used as a good approximation for processes with very slow dynamics, i.e. small Strouhal numbers. The use of KNu instead of the complex trans- fer function might be sufficient in this case. Secondly, it is used here as validation for the identified models. The derivation of the low-frequency limit from heat transfer correlations was detailed by Witte and Polifke (2017 a). The low frequency limit or quasi-steady gain can be read from the frequency re- sponse amplitude at Sr → 0 (e.g. Figure 6.026) or from the step response at t → ∞(cf. Figure 6.01). However, there is a third method deriving the quantity from a steady- state Nußelt correlation like the ones given by Collis and Williams (cf. Equa- tion (2.023)) and Sparrow et al (cf. Equation (2.024)). A similar approach was pursued by Polifke and Lawn for premixed flames. The steady-state correlations for the Nußelt number Nu are nonlinear functions of the Reynolds number Re. In some cases, also the Prandtl number Pr is included as a parameter and the fluid and cylinder temperatures. In this thesis, however, the Prandtl number is Pr = 0.07123 in most cases, and absolute temperature differ- ences are neglected. To acquire the quasi-steady-state response to pulsations in the crossflow, a rise in Reynolds number by ∆Re is assumed. The correlation Nu(Re) is linearized around Re 0 and hence the new Nußelt number is given by the Taylor series Nu(Re 0 +∆Re) = Nu(Re 0) + ∂Nu(Re) ∂Re ⃓⃓⃓⃓ Re 0 ∆Re +O((∆Re)2) (6.011) 6 Transfer Function Identification Model Re 0 0.04 4 40 120 240 3900 KNu from Collis and Williams 0.027 0.037 0.041 0.045 KNu from Sparrow et al 0.026 0.041 0.050 0.052 0.053 0.056 KNu from identification 0.026 0.037 0.044 0.045 0.054 0.054 KNu from step response 0.025 0.037 0.042 Table 6.07: Values for the Steady-State Gain KNu.

Inserting Equation (6.011) into the defini- tion of the transfer function GNu (cf. Equation (2.0100)) yields the low frequency limit of the transfer function KNu = Re 0 Nu 0 ∂Nu(Re) ∂Re ⃓⃓⃓⃓ Re 0 (6.012) which is called quasi-steady gain KNu. Using the correlation by Collis and Williams (cf. Equation (2.023)), the steady-state gain can be evaluated with KNu = 0.0252 Re 0.045 0.024 +0.056 Re 0.045. (6.013) For higher Reynolds numbers, the correlation by Sparrow et al (cf. Equa- tion (2.024)) is recommended. The steady-state gain is then KNu = Re 1/2 +0.02 Re 2/3 1.025 Pr−0.037 +2.00 Re 1/2 +0.03 Re 2/3. (6.014) Considering the same Reynolds numbers as for the simulated step response (cf. Section 6.01), the results of the linearization are compared to identification and step response in Table 6.07. It can be seen that the results agree reasonably well, especially for Re 0 = 4, with the largest discrepancy between correlation and identification for Re 0 = 40 of about 7 %. 6.05.03 Skin Friction A comparison between the models identified in this thesis and analytical results was given by (Witte and Polifke, 2019). The analytical models providing the best description of the dynamic behavior of the skin friction over a wide range of frequencies were reported by Lighthill and Gersten. However, no single model for the whole range of Strouhal numbers 6.05 Discussion |Gc f | 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 400 π/8 π/4 3π/8 Sr ∠Gc f Figure 6.036: Skin Friction Frequency Response.

Furthermore, two different types of boundary layers HL and BL were con- sidered respectively by both authors (cf. Section 3.02). Flat plate flow was evaluated with the frequency parameter Srx/d. Figure 6.036 shows amplitude and phase of the complex-valued frequency response of the skin friction to pulsation in the free-stream velocity. Solid lines denote iden- tified models for Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40. The model by Lighthill was detailed in Section 3.02.02. The frequency responses for HL and BL are shown in Figure 3.02 and Figure 3.03, respectively. They are represented in Figure 6.036 in green. The frequency response developed by Gersten is shown in Figure 3.05 and Figure 3.06 for the HL and the BL, respectively. Section 3.02.04 outlines the derivation. Lines associated with the results developed by Gersten are colored purple. The graphs of the HL solution is dashed, and the BL solution is shown dash dotted for x/d = 1. At low frequencies, i.e. small values of Strouhal numbers Sr, the results from Lighthill and Gersten match well. The steady-state gain derives from the fact that the drag force depends on velocity by Fd ∼ u(3/2) in the boundary layer approximation. In the results from SI, the low frequency limits are changing 6 Transfer Function Identification with Reynolds number with values only slightly above unity for small mean flow Reynolds numbers (regime of linear drag) and approaching a value of two at higher Re 0 (Fd ∼ u 2) (Polifke and Lawn, 2007). Lighthill and Bayly reported an anticipation time for the skin friction of cτ = 0.005 for the HL and cτ = 1.07 x/d for the BL. The pressure gradient necessary to accelerate the flow acts faster on the boundary layer than on the free-stream. This creates the impression of the skin friction anticipating a change in velocity, which manifests itself as a phase lead. Lighthill stated that the approximation is applicable for Sr > 20. Hence, at this Strouhal number, the low frequency solution merges with the high frequency approximation. Gersten’ s series expansion yields a smoother transition between low and high frequency approximation. CFD/SI re- sults show an approximate anticipation time of cτ = 0.07, which is not depending on Reynolds number. At low Strouhal numbers, neither the HL solution nor the BL solution is comparable to the identified frequency response. This is due to the fact that neither limiting case of the wedge flow is particularly fitting for the skin friction at the cylinder. This is supported by the examination of the circumferential distribution of the skin friction pulsations (cf. Section 7.04). At low frequencies, the gross of the skin friction fluctuations occur at an angle of φ ≈ π/4 which is exactly in between the HL (φ ≈ 0) and the BL (φ ≈ π/2). 7 Flow Field Representations To shed light on the dynamic processes in the flow field around the cylinder, various representations of flow patterns and temperature distributions are presented in this chapter. To provide a reference, the steady-state flow fields for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40 are depicted in Section 7.01. Section 7.02 shows changes in the velocity field and the temperature field caused by a sudden increase in the free-stream velocity by 10 %. This corresponds to the conditions of a simulated step response and the flow fields originate from the same simulations as in Section 6.01. The fields are calculated with the time domain approach (cf. Sec- tion 5.02). From the solution of the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, fluctuations in temperature and vorticity at specific frequencies can be depicted. Section 7.03 in- cludes fields of amplitude and phase of these fluctuations for a range of frequencies. Qualitative explanations for certain occurring phenomena, like the peak gain and the phase lag at high frequencies, that differ from previously reported studies are provided. Circumferential distributions of the fluctuations of the Nußelt number and the friction coefficient are reported in Section 7.04. 7.01 Steady State For all simulations, the steady-state solution serves as a reference point. The step response computation needs a preliminary steady state which is excited with a sud- den increase in velocity. The LNSE results are linearized around a steady state and also the CFD/SI procedure requires a steady-state (or quasi-steady-state) flow field as an initial solution. This way, the influence of an initial transient, which should not be part of the solution, is minimized. Figures 7.01 to 7.03 show the steady-state temperature distribution on the left and the velocity magnitude on the right. The plots are captured from the same simulations carried out to acquire the data for the step response detailed in Section 6.01. The excerpt extends from −2 d to 4 d in x 1-direction and from 0 to 3 d in x 2-direction. Black lines represent the pseudo-streamlines of the flow (from left to right). The colors indicate regions where values of dimensionless temperature Θ0 = Θ(x, y,0) and values of dimensionless velocity magnitude |u 0| = |u|(x, y, 0), respectively, are higher (red) or lower (blue).

The cases Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40 are shown in Figure 7.02 and Figure 7.03, respectively. At low Reynolds numbers and low Péclet numbers, heat conduction and viscous effects dominate over the convective transport. The flow field around the cylinder is influenced in a large area as can be seen in the case of Re 0 = 0.04 in Figure 7.01. At higher Reynolds numbers, the area of the flow field affected by the presence of the cylinder becomes smaller (cf. Figure 7.02). This is attended by stronger gradients. At Re 0 = 40, recirculation occurs which is visible in Figure 7.03. 7.02 Step Response The flow around the cylinder is subject to a sudden change in flow velocity (step excitation). The Reynolds number is increased by ϵ = 0.01, i.e. 10 % of the initial Reynolds number Re 0. This step response model is described in Section 6.01. The response of the flow field is represented here as absolute differences in dimen- sionless temperature δΘ and dimensionless velocity magnitude δu at a specific time instant compared to the initial steady-state field. This can be expressed as δΘ(x, y, t) = [︁ Θ(x, y, t) −Θ(x, y, 0) ]︁ and (7.01) δu(x, y, t) = [︁ |u|(x, y, t) −|u|(x, y,0) ]︁. (7.02) The following figures (Figure 7.04 – Figure 7.09) show the flow field in proximity to the cylinder for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 0.04, Re 0 = 4, and Re 0 = 40, respec- tively. The plots were captured from the same simulations carried out to acquire the data for the step response detailed in Section 6.01. The excerpt extends from −2 d to 4 d in x 1-direction and from 0 to 3 d in x 2-direction. Black lines represent the pseudo-streamlines of the flow (from left to right). The colors indicate regions where values of temperature (left column) and values of velocity magnitude (right column) respectively are higher (red) or lower (blue) than the stationary values before the step occurs. A gray color signifies no change. In the figure series, time advances from top to bottom. 7.02.01 Common Features and Behavior The flow fields for all of the mean flow Reynolds numbers depicted here show some common features. The hydrodynamic and the thermal boundary layer are distorted and adapt over time to the new steady-state flow. Initially, the velocity field changes drastically. The red color of the far field depicts the new velocity magnitude after the step input. 7 Flow Field Representations The velocity field changes instantly showing some acceleration of the flow next to the cylinder. The red spot close to the side of the cylinder relative to the flow marks noticeably higher velocities in proximity to the surface. A gray color directly at the cylinder boundary indicates no change, which reflects the fact that the no-slip con- dition is imposed. The flow field relaxes to the new steady state over time, to some extent reversing the sudden changes. The drastic change instantly after the step input is due to the immediate high pres- sure gradient establishing to facilitate the acceleration of the flow. This favorable pressure gradient is responsible for large velocity gradients in proximity to the cylin- der. Another way to interpret this is an increased generation of vorticity at the cylin- der, which is subsequently transported by convection and diffusion. A new, thinner, thermal boundary layer establishes after the step excitation, and hot fluid in proximity to the cylinder is swept away. This is indicated by the comparably cooler (blue) region that forms at the windward side of the cylinder and spreads further downstream at later instances in time. This cooler region shows that there is a higher temperature gradient at the cylinder, resulting in a rise in heat transfer rate. In addition, a hotter zone is initially forming at the lee side of the cylinder over a time of approximately one passage time. Eventually, it is swept away downstream with the flow, and the temperature at the backward stagnation point of the cylinder is also slightly lower than before the perturbation. This is in accordance with the step response behavior of sector 4 as shown in Figure 6.02. The appearance of this hot zone is visible as a drop below the original steady-state value shortly after the step input occurred. The hotter fluid starts to move downstream between t = 0.07 and t = 1.05. 7.02.02 Behavior at Different Mean Flow Reynolds Numbers Figure 7.04 and Figure 7.05 show the flow fields for Re 0 = 0.04. At this low Reynolds number, the flow fields are in transition for a long time, and a new steady state is not reached at the end of the figure series, although the last flow field was captured 25 flow passage times after the step occurred. This can also be seen in Figure 6.01. However, the cold leeward zone and the hot windward zone can readily be detected. Also, the sudden change of the velocity field restores slightly and within a compara- bly large amount of time until the new steady state is reached. In the case of Re 0 = 4 (Figure 7.06 and Figure 7.07), gradients are much stronger and cold and hot zones are more pronounced. In the chosen section, it can be seen that cold and hot regions are confined spots and only extend a few cylinder diameters beyond the center. The zones are more confined than in the case of Re 0 = 0.04. Their size is the same order of magnitude as the steady state boundary field visible in 7.02 Step Response Figure 7.02. The development of the cold zone is partially counteracted and it reaches its maximum after about t ≈ 7 (Figure 7.07, second row). The change in heat transfer rate slows down towards the new steady-state value but still overshoots it. Aftert ≈ 2, the hot zone visible in the third row in Figure 7.06 departs. This corresponds to the positive values that are assumed in the heat transfer step response of sector 4 (cf. Figure 6.02 (b)). The step response flow field of a cylinder in crossflow with an initial Reynolds number of Re 0 = 40 (Figure 7.08 and Figure 7.09) shows a slightly different behavior. The recirculation zone (circular pseudo-streamlines at the lee side of the cylinder) contracts suddenly at time t = 0 and slowly grows again until a stationary state is reached. Only a small section at the cylinder, close to the flow separation point, remains colored in gray indicating no change. Again, the pressure gradient necessary to accelerate the flow affects the boundary layer. The adverse pressure gradient due to the curvature is counteracted by the favorable pressure gradient from the step input. This causes the separation point, where the flow cannot longer follow the curvature of the cylinder and the recircu- lation zone starts, to shift towards the rearward stagnation point. The recirculation zone seems to collapse and is restored when the excess of vorticity is transported downstream. The size of the colder and hotter zones are smaller than in the case of Re 0 = 0.04 and Re 0 = 4, similar o the steady-state boundary field visible in Figure 7.03. Gradients are stronger (different color scales are used) and changes are faster, e.g. happen in shorter succession to the step input than at lower mean flow Reynolds numbers. Stronger gradients also indicate a greater change in heat transfer rate. While the hotter zone is washed downstream after about one passage time, the size of the colder zone peaks around t = 2 and shrinks until a new steady state is reached. 7 Flow Field Representations 0 0.0015−0.0015 0.003−0.003 0 0.01−0.01 0.02−0.02 Figure 7.04: Flow Field Representation of the Step Response (Re 0 = 0.04) I.

Section 6.02). It can also show the response of the com- plete (linearized) flow field around the cylinder subject to fluctuations of a specific frequency. 7.03.01 Amplitude of Vorticity and Temperature Fluctuation In the following series of figures (Figure 7.010– Figure 7.015), the amplitude field of linearized temperature fluctuations |Θ1| (left column) and the field of vorticity fluc- tuation amplitude |ζ1| (right column) are shown. The excerpt extends from −2 d to 4 d in x 1-direction and from 0 to 3 d in x 2-direction. Black lines are isolines of the steady-state stream functionψ0, i.e. they are streamlines for the mean flow from left to right. Figure 7.010 and Figure 7.011 show the linearized temperature field and velocity mag- nitude field at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 0.04 for different Strouhal numbers Sr ∈ {0.001,0.01, 0.05,1,2,5,10, 40}. A Strouhal number of Sr = 0.001 was cho- sen to approximate a quasi-steady state. A major outcome is that the temperature fluctuations are strong for Sr ≤ 0.05. At Strouhal numbers of Sr = 0.001 and Sr = 0.01, the amplitude of Θ1 assumes large values upwind of the cylinder visible as red areas. The fluctuations at values greater than Sr > 0.05 are comparably weak. This corre- sponds to the strong low-pass behavior visible in Figure 6.026. The amplitude field of the vorticity fluctuations |ζ1| does not change much at Strouhal numbers below the order of one. All vorticity fluctuations are generated at the cylinder and most strongly in sector 2. The frequency response of the skin fric- tion also shows only minor changes in amplitude at low Strouhal numbers, which confirms this behavior. At higher Strouhal numbers, e.g. at Sr= 40, the generation of vorticity fluctuations is much stronger than at low Strouhal numbers. The dynamic boundary layer thickness is small, and hence the velocity gradients are large. The maximum of the vorticity generation moves slightly downstream so that the field becomes almost symmetric to the y-axis. Representations of the linearized flow field subject to periodic pulsations of the velocity at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 4 are given in Figure 7.012 and Figure 7.013. At the lowest frequency (Sr = 0.001), the temperature fluctuations close to the forward stagnation point are strong. A localized region of approximately two diameters upstream is affected the most by the velocity fluctuations. The zone of strong fluctuations (red zone) is largest in the second row at Sr = 0.01. This concurs with the peak gain in the transfer function of the heat transfer (cf. Section 6.02). At 7.03 Representations of the Linearized Flow Field Sr = 0.05, a second region of higher fluctuation amplitudes is visible on the lee side of the cylinder. This effect could also be observed for Re 0 = 0.04 and is weaker than the fluctuations in front of the cylinder. The fluctuation amplitude is reduced with higher frequency until no fluctuation is visible in the chosen color scale for Sr = 40. The vorticity fluctuations (right column) behave again differently and are concen- trated around φ = π/4 where most of the vorticity fluctuations are generated at the surface of the cylinder. The affected region extends significantly downstream. As the fluctuations grow stronger at higher frequencies (with a peak value of |ζ1|max = 26.05 at Sr = 40), they concentrate close to the surface of the cylinder. The peak vorticity is located close to φ = π/2, i.e. where the cylinder is thickest. The behavior of the fluctuating quantities, temperature and vorticity, for a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 40 is shown in Figure 7.014 and Figure 7.015. Similar features occur, e.g. the temperature fluctuation at the windward side of the cylinder and the temperature fluctuation right behind the rearward stagnation point, which starts at the very low frequencies (Sr= 0.001) and is visible even at the higher Strouhal numbers. The vorticity fluctuation also behaves similarly to Re 0 = 4 with the most substantial difference visible at the smallest frequencies where the affected region reaches further downstream. Again, the highest value (|ζ1|max = 81.00) is measured at Sr = 40. A major difference to the behavior at the lower mean flow Reynolds numbers is the occurrence of high amplitude fluctuations downstream of the cylinder and in the shear layer next to the recirculation zone. The recirculation zone is visible as the closed streamline at the lee side of the cylinder. The temperature fluctuations in front of the cylinder are comparable in amplitude to the Re 0 = 4 case. The smaller size of this upstream fluctuation zone leads to stronger gradients and hence to larger fluctuation amplitudes in Nußelt number. However, this third fluctuation zone located approximately at φ ≈ 3π/4 exhibits amplitudes almost twice as strong as the forward fluctuation zone. This effect is mostly visible at Sr = 0.05, Sr = 1.00, and Sr = 2.00 (third row and fourth row in Figure 7.014 and first row in Figure 7.015). This sidewards fluctuation zone might explain why the gain of the heat transfer fluctuations exceeds the steady-state value strongly at Strouhal numbers of order one. This region is also visible in the vorticity field but much weaker and without influence on the skin friction fluctuation. 7 Flow Field Representations 0.01 0.015 0.005 0.02 0 2.05 3.075 1.025 5.00 0 Figure 7.010: Linearized Flow Field Representation for Re 0 = 0.04 I.

This section links these representations to the phase field of the complex temperature fluctuations Θ1 relative to the excitation with ei Srt. Low frequencies, at which a peak gain GNu > KNu occurs (Sr ≈ 0.05), are examined as well as the case of Sr ≈ 7, where all transfer functions coincide in a phase value of approximately ∠GNu ≈ −3π/8 (cf. Section 6.04.01). Low Frequencies (Sr = 0.05) Figure 7.016 shows amplitude (left) and phase (right) of the temperature fluctuations caused by periodic pulsations of the flow velocity at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 4 and a Strouhal number of Sr = 0.05. The amplitude field is the same as in Figure 7.012, (third row, left column). It shows the typical windward and leeward fluctuation zones but no sideward fluctuation.

For temperature fluctuations at Re 0 = 40, as depicted in Figure 7.017 (cf. Figure 7.015, third row left column), the sidewards fluctuation zone is visible. For this mean flow Reynolds number, the assessed Strouhal number Sr = 0.05 is very close to the max- imum of the peak gain phenomenon. The phase values, depicted on the right of Figure 7.017, are only shown in places where the amplitude is above 10−3. Windward and sideward fluctuation zones are in the region with positive phase values, i.e. phase lag. The dark blue spot at an angle of φ ≈ 3π/4, indicating phase values of approximately −π, is due to phase wrapping. It occurs when values exceedπ. Hence, again most fluctuations lag in phase except for the leeward zone, which shows neg- ative values in GNu. 7 Flow Field Representations Intermediate Frequencies (Sr = 7) The temperature fluctuations at an intermediate frequency (Sr = 7) and a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 4 are depicted in Figure 7.018. The amplitude values are rather small compared to lower frequencies as was to be expected from the frequency response (cf. Section 6.04.01). The phase field shows a distinct difference be- tween the forward fluctuation zone and the leeward fluctuation zone. In the range of φ = 0 to approximately φ = 3π/4 around the circumference of the cylinder (sector 1 – sector 3), the phase exhibits a lag of approximately π/2. The phase at Re 0 = 40 and Sr = 7 is shown in Figure 7.019. The essential features are the same as in the case of Re 0 = 4. Like in Figure 7.017, phase values are only depicted where the amplitude is above 10 −3. Partition of the field close to the surface of the cylinder is visible like in the case of Re 0 = 4. A pattern of “phase waves” is superim- posed with a wavelength of approximately one cylinder diameter. This corresponds to sinusoidal fluctuations convected with the undisturbed mean flow velocity u 0,∞ (Sr/2π ≈ 1). 7.04 Circumferential Distribution of Heat Transfer and Skin Friction Section 7.03 and Section 7.02 gave descriptions of the linearized flow field close to the cylinder. This section focuses directly on the skin friction and the heat trans- fer computed with the LNSE solver (cf. Section 5.04 and Section 6.02). Similar to the steady-state values for the Nußelt number and the friction coefficient, reported in Section 2.01.02, the circumferential distributions of the fluctuating quantities Nu 1 and c f,1 are shown in polar plots. The top half of each plot represents the amplitude of the complex-valued quantity. The phase is depicted at the bottom of the figure. This viewpoint allows more insight into the influence of the cylindrical shape on the transfer behavior. Figure 7.020 depicts the Nußelt number fluctuations at three different frequencies, Sr = 0.05 (blue), Sr= 7 (red), and Sr= 40 (yellow), for a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 4. The amplitude of Nu 1 greatly reduces with frequency, which concurs with the low-pass behavior of the transfer function (cf. Chapter 6). From this figure, it can be seen that most of the fluctuations occur at the forward stagnation point and diminish towards larger angles. This behavior is also observed for the steady-state values (cf. Figure 2.06). At angles of φ ≈ 3π/4, the amplitude is at its low mark. It recovers slightly towards the backward stagnation point. This change in dynamic behavior is also apparent in the phase of the Nußelt number. Phase values are always below zero for the con- 7.04 Circumferential Distribution of Heat Transfer and Skin Friction 00 0.0250.025 0.050.05 0.0750.075 11 π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π |Nu 1| φ −π 00 ππ π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π ∠Nu 1 φ Figure 7.020: Nußelt Number Distribution at Re 0 = 4. Sr = 0.05 ( ), Sr = 7 ( ), and Sr = 40 ( ). sidered frequencies. At Sr = 7 and Sr = 40, phase wrapping occurs, yielding positive values. This is another indicator for the change of dynamic behavior in sector 4 of the cylinder as it can be observed in the flow fields (cf. Section 7.02 and Section 7.03) as well as in the step response (cf. Section 6.01). At higher Reynolds numbers, the behavior is similar, yet more pronounced. Fig- ure 7.021 shows the circumferential distribution of fluctuating heat transfer at the cylinder at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 40. At Sr = 0.05, which is close to the peak gain frequency of the transfer function, the amplitude values are highest. Again, a drop to very small values is visible at an angle slightly above φ = 3π/4. At the backward stagnation point, the amplitude rises to about 1/4 of the maximum. At angles before the amplitude minimum, the phase exhibits positive values, i.e. phase lag. In this position, the sideward fluctuation zone (cf. Figure 7.017) is located. Although the fluctuations are quite strong, the zone is far away, and hence gradients are comparatively low. 7 Flow Field Representations 00 11 22 33 44 π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π |Nu 1| φ −π 00 ππ π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π ∠Nu 1 φ Figure 7.021: Nußelt Number Distribution at Re 0 = 40. Sr = 0.05 ( ), Sr = 7 ( ), and Sr = 40 ( ). The phase at high frequencies tends towards lower values. At a distinct angle close to φ = 3π/4, the phase drops about an amount ofπ causing the phase to be wrapped in Figure 7.021. The angle at which the phase jump occurs is slightly dependent on frequency and moves towards smaller angles with rising Strouhal number. Figure 7.022 displays the friction coefficient pulsation c f,1, derived from the lin- earized flow fields for three different frequencies (Sr = 0.05, Sr = 7, and Sr = 40) and a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 4. The maximum amplitude rises with fre- quency as can as well be seen in the skin friction transfer function. No fluctuation occurs at the forward stagnation point. Hence, the amplitude appears egg-shaped in the polar plot. At the lowest frequency shown here (Sr = 0.05), the maximum occurs at approximately φ ≈ 3π/4 and moves to an angle of φ ≈ π/2 at very high Strouhal numbers. The skin friction at high frequencies shows symmetry also in the direction perpendicular to the flow, which is also visible in the linearized flow field (cf. Figure 7.013). Moreover, this is reflected in the phase ofc f,1 which uniformly 7.04 Circumferential Distribution of Heat Transfer and Skin Friction 00 44 88 1212 1616 π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π |c f 1 | φ −π 00 ππ π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π ∠c f 1 φ Figure 7.022: Friction Coefficient Distribution at Re 0 = 4. Sr = 0.05 ( ), Sr = 7 ( ), and Sr = 40 ( ). approaches < c f,1 = π/4 at high Strouhal numbers. At Sr = 0.05, it can be seen that the phase lead close to the backward stagnation point is almost ∠c f,1 = π/2. This shows that only weak inertial forces act on the fluid in this region and it responds to a change in pressure, which is necessary to accelerate or decelerate the flow, almost instantly. At a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 40, as shown in Figure 7.023, the friction coefficient behaves in a very similar manner. The amplitudes are smaller than in the case of Re 0 = 4, but this also applies to the steady-state value to an even larger extent. Hence, the frequency response (cf. Figure 6.026) has higher amplitudes at greater mean flow Reynolds numbers. The phase lead close to the backward stagnation point exceeds ∠c f,1 = −π/2, i.e. even precedes pressure fluctuations required to accelerate the flow. This is probably caused by the recirculation zone. 7 Flow Field Representations 00 11 22 33 44 π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π |c f 1 | φ −π 00 ππ π/8 π/4 3π/4 π/2 5π/8 3π/4 7π/8 π ∠c f 1 φ Figure 7.023: Friction Coefficient Distribution at Re 0 = 40. Sr = 0.05 ( ), Sr = 7 ( ), and Sr = 40 ( ). 7.05 Discussion Three different representations of the spatial distribution of fluctuations in flow quantities have been shown in this section. The flow fields acquired from the step response give a detailed insight into the temporal evolution of the velocity field and the temperature field close to the cylinder. The same detail is depicted for periodic forcing computed with the LNSE. This illuminates the dynamic behavior from a frequency space point of view, which is the basis for the transfer functions. Also computed with the linearized solver are the circumferential distributions of the Nußelt number and friction coefficients. They are a direct result of the surface normal gradients in the LNSE flow fields at certain Strouhal numbers. All of these representations shed light on the dynamic behavior of the heat transfer and the skin friction as well as the distinct features of the respective transfer functions. 7.05 Discussion Deviations from models reported previously, especially the model by Lighthill, can be physically motivated and explained. Most notably, the peak gain phenomenon and the phase lag in the heat transfer as well as the low-frequency behavior of the skin friction. The latter is very uniquely linked in its time scales to the cylindrical shape. In the light of these investigations, the analytical approach by Lighthill (1954, cf. Section 3.02.02) can be reassessed. In short, Lighthill’ s assumptions and simplifica- tions can be summarized as follows: (1) The boundary layer equations were used to describe the flow. Lighthill then treated these equations differently for the limit of low and high frequencies. He later identified Sr = 20 as the frequency where both limiting solutions approximately matched for the skin friction. (2) High frequencies were assessed using the solution of Stokes’ second problem (Stokes, 1851, cf. Section 3.01.02). (3) For low frequencies, the term including the frequency parameter (Strouhal number) could not be assumed small, and hence, simplifica- tions similar to those made by Stokes were not possible. Instead, Lighthill used an integral Kármán–Polhausen treatment (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006). (4) The parameters for the fourth order polynomial profiles were taken from solutions for the flat plate boundary layer (Blasius layer) and the stagnation point flow (Hiemenz layer) (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006). From the steady-state flow fields depicted in Section 7.01, it already becomes evi- dent that the notion of a boundary layer (assumption 1) does not apply to the flow around a cylinder with mean flow Reynolds numbers of Re 0 = 0.04 and Re 0 = 4 (Fig- ure 7.01 and Figure 7.02, respectively). Even at Re 0 = 40, the zone disturbed by the flow is not only a thin layer (Figure 7.03). Lighthill stated that his approximate solution should be valid above Re 0 > 10, but this limit has to be raised in the light of this investigation. This is noteworthy inasmuch as most Rijke tubes operate at mean flow Reynolds numbers below Re 0 < 40 (cf. Table 3.01). Lighthill built his model on the observation that the major part of the heat transfer occurs in the front quadrant of the cylinder (assumption 4). The findings in this thesis confirm this also for the fluctuations and even for lower Reynolds num- bers. However, still a significant part of the heat transfer occurs at angles φ > π/4. This also points to one of the main limitations in any study using the boundary layer equations to describe the flow (assumption 1). The heat transfer at the lee side of the cylinder (sector 4 at angles φ > 3π/4) is not negligible and has a different phase than the windward part of the cylinder (cf. Fig- ure 7.020 and Figure 7.021). It causes the theoretical phase limit of ∠GNu > −π/2 at Sr → ∞predicted by Lighthill never to be reached. Using Stokes’ solution for the high frequency behavior cannot represent this as Stokes developed it for a flat plate (assumption 2). Also, the low frequency approximation, which is a first order time lag system, has the same theoretical limit of ∠GNu(Sr → ∞) = −π/2 and can- 7 Flow Field Representations not represent this phenomenon. For the skin friction at high frequencies, however, Stokes’ second problem (cf. Section 3.01.02) is a good approximation even for curved geometries like the cylinder. Föller and Polifke also reported that the limiting frequency was above ∠GNu > −π/2. However, the recirculation zone, as proposed by Föller and Polifke, can now be ruled out as a cause for this difference in phase because no recirculation occurs at Re 0 = 4. The enlarged phase limit occurs predominately at low mean flow Reynolds numbers. Inspecting the solution by Bayly, which specifically treats Re 0 < 1, reveals also phase values above ∠GNu > −π/2 at high Strouhal numbers. However, the limit of Bayly’ s formula is still −π/2 which is reached through a prolonged descent. Assumption (3) was not assessed in further detail in this thesis. However, it can be assumed that a fully resolved solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equa- tions is more accurate than the integral treatment approximating velocity profiles and temperature profiles by fourth order polynomials. 8 Low Order Parametrized Model for Heat Transfer The identified models presented in Chapter 6 for the heat transfer show very good agreement with the data acquired from CFD simulations. Each model can be seen as the best fit for the respective mean flow Reynolds number. To acquire a model for mean flow conditions not reported in this thesis, an interpolation technique can be used: For the two models at the conditions closest to the desired one, the impulse response has to be computed. Ideally, this is done in discrete time at the desired sampling rate. Linear interpolation between two coefficients of different models representing the same time lag is subsequently used to acquire a new impulse re- sponse coefficient at every time lag. The new model can be used as an FIR model directly, or as data for the identification of a new transfer function in the desired framework. The work shown here was previously published in parts in Witte and Polifke (2016, 2019). In this chapter, a different approach is pursued. Simple models for the dynamics of the heat transfer have been used in the past. Especially in modeling the heat transfer dynamics of the Rijke tube, two model types stand out: the n-τ model and the PT 1 time lag model. In most of the literature associated with the modeling of thermoa- coustic oscillations in a Rijke tube one of these models is used (cf. Table 3.01). In this chapter, a PT 1 model including the mean flow Reynolds number as a parameter is proposed. The complexity is reduced to yield a model in the manner of Lighthill or Bayly. The n-τ model and the PT 1 model are introduced in Section 8.01 as simple models for heat transfer behavior with some desirable properties. Both models are compared, and the strengths and weaknesses of each model type are reported. A first order time lag model parametrized with the mean flow Reynolds number is presented in Section 8.02. The chapter concludes with three case studies showing the impact of temperature dependent fluid properties, i.e. different Prandtl numbers, different cylinder temperatures, and amplitude in the order of the mean flow Reynolds num- ber (cf. Section 8.03). 8 Low Order Parametrized Model for Heat Transfer 8.01 Low Order Models Low order models are popular in the modeling of thermoacoustic devices. On the one hand, they offer certain mathematical advantages over more sophisticated methods and can be used in pen and paper calculations as well as for educated guesses. On the other hand, the accuracy provided by these low order methods is not as good as the accuracy of the individually identified models but probably still within the margins of other uncertainties. 8.01.01 n −τ Model A model for low frequencies, very often used in thermoacoustic applications, is that of a time delayed heat transfer, the so-calledn −τ model. It assumes that an output depends only on one past input which occurred some timeτ in the past, scaled with the interaction index n. Time and frequency domain representations are given by y Nu = n u Re(t −cτ) and (8.01) GNu = n e−i Srcτ, (8.02) with the dimensionless time constantcτ = τ·u 0,∞/d. The scaled pulsation in Nußelt number Nu′/Nu 0 is again denoted by y Nu and likewise for the Reynolds number pulsations u Re. In the frequency domain, it has a constant gain of n, and the phase decreases linearly with slope −cτ. This model is especially interesting for computations in the time domain. As a dis- crete model, the impulse response has only one nonzero coefficient which consider- ably simplifies calculations compared to other dynamic models. It can also be used in conjunction with the theory of delayed differential equations. 8.01.02 PT 1 Model The PT 1 model is a continuous time transfer function of order one. It follows the structure outlined in Equation (4.024), but with only one parameter for numerator and denominator. It reads G(s) = b 0 1 +a 1 s. (8.03) The numerator coefficient b 0 = K is the steady-state gain and the coefficient of the denominator is a time constant a 1. The PT 1 model, like the n −τ model, has two parameters. Under the assumption of a positive time constant, the system is always BIBO stable. However, its impulse 8.01 Low Order Models 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 1.02 |G| 0 0.05 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 4 4.05 5-π -π/2 π/2 π Sr ∠G Figure 8.01: Frequency Response of PT 1 and n −τ.

In the fre- quency domain, this is the simplest representation of a low-pass filter which fulfills the condition that the amplitude approaches zero G(s) → 0 in the limit of high fre- quencies s → ∞. 8.01.03 n −τ Model as Linearization of First Order Lag PT 1 model and n −τ model are related in that sense that the slope of the phase of the frequency response at zero frequency can be perceived as originating from a time lag cτ. This relationship can be seen in the phase graph in the bottom plot of Figure 8.01 where both models coincide at low frequencies. Another point of view is that the PT 1 model can be acquired from a Taylor expansion of the n −τ model. The n −τ model is given in Equation (8.01). A response is caused by a signal that occurred at a dimensionless timet −cτ in the past. This is equivalent to saying a signal will cause a response at t +cτ in the future. Hence, the model is reformulated to y Nu(t +cτ) = n u Re.

(8.05) This ordinary differential equation is the time domain equivalent to the PT 1 model with n = b 0 and cτ = a 1. Figure 8.02 shows the impulse response of a PT 1 model (continuous time) and an −τ model (discrete time). Both the interaction index/steady-state gain and the time constant, are set to unity, i.e.n = K = 1 and cτ = 1, respectively. 8.01.04 Comparison of Low Order Parametrized Models The advantage of the pure time delay model ( n −τ model) is that the convolution equation, necessary to determine the heat transfer for any velocity perturbation in the time domain, is a simple multiplication and thus reduces complexity. However, compared to a first order transfer behavior, i.e. Equation (3.034) or Equation (8.03), it is important to note that the differences in amplitude and phase increase with fre- quency. The deviation can be assessed by analyzing the quantitycτ·Sr. The time con- stant is the inverse of the cutoff frequency of the first-order system and Sr c = 1/cτ is the cutoff Strouhal number. Hence,cτ ·Sr = 1 corresponds to the cutoff frequency. At this frequency, the difference in amplitude is already around 30 % relative to the 8.02 Parametrized First Order Time Lag Model steady-state value and about 12° (0.0068 π) in phase. At cτ · Sr = 3, i.e. three times the cutoff frequency, the amplitude of the n −τ model is more than 384 % too high, and the difference in phase is greater than π/2. These values can be observed in Figure 8.01 where n = K = 1 and cτ = 1 and hence the cutoff frequency of the PT 1 model is Src = 1. This is noteworthy inasmuch as Rijke tubes may operate in this regime. Matveev (2003 a) for example reported working conditions (Re ≈ 2.03, Sr ≈ 4.00) leading to a value of cτ ·Sr ≈ 4.05 considering Equation (8.06) for the time constant. 8.02 Parametrized First Order Time Lag Model Following the model by Lighthill (1954, cf. Equation (3.034)) approximations to the higher order identified transfer functions are given as a PT 1 model. This is possible because the dynamic behavior is governed to a large extent by only one time lag and a steady-state gain. For all mean flow Reynolds numbers, the steady-state gain and time constant were determined by identifying a transfer function with one free pa- rameter for the numerator and the denominator respectively using continuous time identification (cf. Section 4.04.05). Through nonlinear regression over K and cτ of 12 identified models in the range 0.01≤ Re 0 ≤ 40, respectively, the following correlations were found: K = 0.025 Re 0.02 0 and cτ = 1.08 Re−0.08 0 +0.02 (8.06) With these expressions the PT 1 model proposed as low order model for the heat transfer oscillations caused by pulsations in free-stream velocity reads GNu(Sr,Re) = 0.025 Re 0.02 1 + (︁ 1.08 Re−0.08 0 +0.02 )︁ i Sr. (8.07) The goodness of fit (NRMSE-fit Φ) for the models by Lighthill and Bayly as well as the first order approximation presented here is shown in Figure 8.03. Additionally, the Φ-values for the best identified models (at a specific mean flow Reynolds number) are given, which correspond to the frequency responses reported in Section 6.04. As already reported by the respective authors, Lighthill’ s and Bayly’ s models have limited validity in the range 0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40. Bayly’ s model shows high accuracy for Re 0 → 0, but should not be used for Reynolds numbers above Re 0 = 0.05. Lighthill states that his model is applicable if a laminar boundary layer exists and gives Re > 10 as the limit. However, better accuracy can be achieved by using the Reynolds number dependent model presented here. 8 Low Order Parametrized Model for Heat Transfer 0.01 1 10 400 Re Φ in % Figure 8.03: NRMSE-Fit of Different Models.Output from Lighthill ( ), Bayly ( ) The first order approximation presented here ( ) and the identified models providing the best fit ( ). 8.03 Limitations and Corrections of the PT 1 Model The mean flow Reynolds number is one of the most important parameters, espe- cially in the range of low Reynolds numbers as they occur in Rijke tubes. Never- theless, there are other parameters not explicitly accounted for in the PT 1 model presented in this thesis. This includes the Prandtl number of the flow, the actual temperature difference between wire and free-stream, and the amplitude of the oscillations in the flow velocity. 8.03.01 Influence of Prandtl Number The Prandtl number is a parameter in the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, more precisely in the temperature equation (Equation (2.065)). It can be seen as the ratio of the boundary layer thicknesses and is therefore directly related to the dynamic behavior. All simulations for this thesis were conducted with Pr = 0.07123, which is a common value for air at ambient conditions. Figure 8.04 and Figure 8.05 show the frequency responses of the heat transfer at mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40, respectively, at different Prandtl num- bers. The responses were evaluated with the LNSE approach (cf. Section 5.04) and for several Prandtl numbers in the range 0.05 ≤ Pr ≤ 10. This covers most gases and also 8.03 Limitations and Corrections of the PT 1 Model 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠ GNu Figure 8.04: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer at Re 0 = 4 and Various Pr.Ampli- tude (top) and phase (bottom) at Pr= 0.05 ( ), Pr = 0.07123 ( ), Pr = 1.00 ( ), Pr = 2.00 ( ), Pr = 5.00 ( ), and Pr = 10.00 ( ). 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠ GNu Figure 8.05: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer at Re 0 = 40 and Various Pr.

For gases, for which the Prandtl number is usually between 0.05 ≤ Pr ≤ 1.00, Pr has only a minor influence and may be negligible for most pur- poses. Higher Prandtl numbers have a similar effect as higher Reynolds numbers. The amplitude of the frequency response has a greater low-frequency limit, and the peak around Sr ≈ 1 is more pronounced. Moreover, the dominant time scale becomes smaller which manifests in the phase of the frequency response as a less steep initial descent. 8.03.02 Influence of Absolute Temperature A much more important factor than the Prandtl number for many applications is the actual temperature difference between the surface of the cylinder and the free- stream. If the temperature at the surface of the cylinder is substantially different from the flow temperature, the fluid parameters are not constant and lead to a dif- ferent dynamic behavior. The small temperature difference assumption, introduced for most computations in this thesis, allowed to reduce the complexity of the CFD simulations and to compare the results with other studies. The influence of the cylinder temperature was surveyed using the full compressible Navier–Stokes equations (Equation (2.028)–(2.032)) together with SI (CFD/SI). The computational procedure was the same as detailed in Section 5.02 and the fluid properties were evaluated using the instantaneous temperature field as well as the laws given in Section 2.02.02 for air. An ambient temperature of 300 K was chosen for the computations, and the temperature of the cylinder was determined by a temperature difference ∆T. Four temperature differences, ∆T = 10 K, ∆T = 100 K, ∆T = 300 K, and ∆T = 600 K, were assessed at mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 40. The first ∆T is well within the limits of small temperature differences while the latter corresponds to a cylinder temperature of 626.085 ◦C. A heated wire would show a faint red glow at this temperature. The numerical procedure was also adapted from the incompressible simulations. This also includes the time step size, which means that acoustic waves were underresolved and the acoustic CFL number was much greater than unity. The frequency response at different ∆T is depicted in Figure 8.06. The color of the graph indicates the temperature from blue to red. For comparison, the frequency responses assessed with the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations at Re 0 = 2 and Re 0 = 4 are included as dashed lines. The frequency response at the lowest tem- perature difference matches fairly well with the response from the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations at the same mean flow Reynolds number. The largest dif- ference is visible in the phase at high frequencies. This is due to the fact that the assumption of acoustical compactness becomes weaker at high frequencies (high Helmholtz numbers, cf. Section 2.04.02). The time it takes for an acoustic pulsation to reach the cylinder is infinitely small in the case of the incompressible Navier– 8.03 Limitations and Corrections of the PT 1 Model 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠ GNu Figure 8.06: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer at Re 0 = 4 and Different ∆ T.

For reference, the frequency re- sponse for Re 0 = 4 and Re 0 = 2 (incompressible) are shown ( ). Stokes equations. When the compressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved, the finite propagation speed leads to slightly higher phase lags. However, the complete system, consisting of data acquisition plane and cylinder with an extent of approx- imately 9 d, is still acoustically fairly compact (He. 0.01, c.f. Section 9.01.03). Higher temperature differences, i.e. higher cylinder temperatures, lead to a reduction in amplitude of the frequency response. At∆T = 600 K, the frequency response is com- parable to lower mean flow Reynolds numbers. This effect can be explained by the influence of the temperature on the fluid properties. The fluid close to the cylinder heats up substantially, resulting in a higher viscosity. This, in turn, implies a smaller Reynolds number. To account for this effect, an effective mean flow Reynolds num- ber can be calculated from the arithmetic mean of the free-stream viscosity and the viscosity at the cylinder temperature. With this effective Reynolds number, Equa- tion (8.07) can be used with reasonable accuracy at higher temperature differences. At a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 40, this tendency is reversed. As depicted in Figure 8.07, the amplitude reaches higher values, and the peak gain is more pro- nounced. This could be attributed to the thermal conductivity of air, which rises with rising temperature. The lowest temperature difference ( ∆T = 10 K) produced results with rising amplitude towards higher frequencies. This was unexpected, since higher temperature differences, as well as the quasi-isothermal simulation, do not exhibit this behavior. It is, therefore, most likely an artifact occurring at 8 Low Order Parametrized Model for Heat Transfer 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 |GNu| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-3π/4 -π/2 -π/4 π/4 Sr ∠ GNu Figure 8.07: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer at Re 0 = 40 and Different ∆ T.

Temperature differences up to ∆T = 300 K, however, match fairly well with the in- compressible solution. The most distinct feature is the peak gain at ∆T = 600 K which is more pronounced and shifted towards higher frequencies than at lower temperature differences. 8.03.03 High Amplitudes The constraint to small amplitudes, as it was chosen in this thesis to stay within the framework of an LTI system, may be too restrictive in some cases. In the Rijke tube, for example, amplitudes can be as high as the mean flow itself when a limit cycle, i.e. a state of quasi-steady high-amplitude oscillations, is reached Matveev (2003 b). With an LTI model, the initial stability and growth rates can be assessed, but not the high amplitude behavior due to its nonlinear nature. Selimefendigil investi- gated the nonlinear behavior of the heat transfer of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow (Selimefendigil and Polifke, 2011; Selimefendigil et al, 2012). More information on the nonlinear behavior was also given by Orchini et al. In this thesis, only a glimpse at the nonlinear behavior in the form of high- amplitude periodic oscillations is provided. The results shown here are based on 8.03 Limitations and Corrections of the PT 1 Model −40 −20 0 20 40 60 80 100 1200 Re Nu Figure 8.08: Nußelt Number for Sinusoidal Fluctuations of Sr = 0.05 at Re 0 = 40.

Figure 8.08 depicts the Reynolds number and the Nußelt number as acquired from simulations with monofrequent modulation of the inlet velocity. The black line shows the steady- state correlation by Collis and Williams (cf. Equation (2.023)). The solid blue and red lines show the evolution of Re and Nu acquired from simulations with rel- ative excitation amplitudes of 100 % and 150 % of the mean flow Reynolds number, respectively. The velocity was forced at Sr = 0.05 and a mean flow Reynolds number Re 0 = 40. The dashed lines represent the respective response from identified linear models. Especially when the flow decelerates, i.e. at low instantaneous Reynolds numbers, the simulated response differs from the linear models and the steady state. The lat- ter is due to the dynamic behavior in general, which at a Strouhal number of Sr= 0.05 differs considerably from the steady state. The outputs of the linear models appear as perfect ellipses with position and size determined by the input and the transfer function. The true response, however, is subject to nonlinearities which lead to a distortion of the ellipse. This distortion is already quite articulate at Re 0 = 20. This is in accordance with the observation, e.g. by Heckl that nonlinearities become eminent at amplitudes of 30 % and above. 8 Low Order Parametrized Model for Heat Transfer From Figure 8.08, it can also be seen that dynamic response and amplitude are not in- terdependent. The identification of a Wiener–Hammerstein model (Tangirala, 2014, p. 781), a simple nonlinear model incorporating an OE model for the dynamics, did not yield significant improvement over purely linear models. With a Wiener– Hammerstein model, it is possible to skip the linearization and scaling steps in the data preparation, but the nonlinearity is added as one or two separate blocks, separating dynamics and nonlinearity. However, the NRMSE-fit of the linear model to data acquired from broadband simulation with amplitudes up to 150 % was still Φ > 80 %. This means that even in the case of amplitudes higher than the linear limit, the linear models perform adequately as long as the determination of the exact pulsation amplitude is not the primary purpose. Even higher amplitudes, however, will lead to worse model fits due to the discrepancy between model output and CFD simulation data visible at low and negative Re. 8.03.04 Discussion In this chapter, well known low order models used in the modeling of Rijke tubes were introduced. Building upon this foundation a new low order PT 1 model for the heat transfer dynamics with the mean flow Reynolds number was introduced. It was developed from simulations at 12 different mean flow Reynolds numbers in the range 0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40 using SI methods. This newly developed model yields a better description of the time lagged dynamics than the n −τ model with just one time delay and constant amplitude. It was also shown that it performs considerably better than the analytical models reported by Lighthill and Bayly in the range of interest. The new parametrized PT 1 model was developed based on CFD simulations, per- formed with the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, and identified with a linear model structure. Three different shortcomings of this approach have been addressed: Different Prandtl numbers, variable fluid properties in conjunction with large temperature differences, and high pulsation amplitudes. It was shown that the Prandtl number has a much weaker impact on the frequency response than the Reynolds number and can readily be omitted from the parametrization. Moreover, although the temperature difference between the free-stream and the surface of the cylinder has some influence on the dynamic behavior, it does not change it fun- damentally and may be corrected with simple measures, e.g. an effective Reynolds number. The model is by its nature restricted to the linear regime. However, if ex- citation amplitudes do not exceed the mean flow too much, the parametrized PT 1 model may still yield fair approximations of the true nonlinear dynamics. Excita- tion amplitudes up to ϵ = 1.05, i.e. 150 % of the mean flow velocity, were examined. Reasonable agreement of Φ > 80 % was found for this case. 9 Aspects of Applications Three different aspects of applications of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow will be presented in this chapter. The first application, detailed in Section 9.01, is the Rijke tube. This device was the main reason for the original study by Lighthill and likewise for the investigations in this thesis. Additionally, the hot-wire anemometer is discussed in this regard in Section 9.02. Not only pulsations in the magnitude of the velocity are considered but also a fluctuating angle of attack. Finally, the common- alities and differences between a cylinder in crossflow and a heat exchanger (HX) as used in domestic boilers are mentioned briefly in Section 9.03. 9.01 Rijke Tube A Rijke tube, named after Pieter Leonard Rijke, who in 1859 was the first to describe its assembly and operation, is a prototype of a thermoacoustic device. Reviews on the subject were written by Feldman and Raun et al. A short survey of recent studies was given in Section 3.06. The response of the heat transfer between cylinder and fluid to fluctuations in flow velocity plays an important role in the Ri- jke tube. Thermal energy, introduced through a heated wire mesh, is transferred to acoustic energy, which can be experienced as audible sound. Prerequisites for this effect are a resonator tube, a mean flow through the tube, and proper positioning of the wire mesh. The Rijke tube is depicted schematically in Figure 9.01. A single wire of the mesh can be treated as a heated cylinder in crossflow. A standing wave exists in the resonator tube similar to an organ pipe. The acoustic pulsations of the fluid velocity in the tube cause pulsations of the heat transfer rate. The transfer behavior between these velocity perturbations and the heat transfer is, therefore, an important parameter for the stability of thermoacoustic oscillations and the operation of the Rijke tube in general. This transfer behavior is described by the transfer functions developed in this thesis (cf. Chapter 6). 9.01.01 Mode of Operation The mode of operation can be divided into an acoustic part, the mean flow, and the interaction of both causing thermoacoustic instabilities. 9 Aspects of Applications u D L Figure 9.01: Sketch of a Rjike Tube.Basic dimensions and the mean flow are marked. Acoustics The Rijke tube is usually built as a short pipe from a rigid material such as alu- minum, steel, or glass. Similar to an organ pipe, the gas column inside the tube has a natural frequency. Both ends of the tube are open. Hence, pressure nodes occur at the openings, and the tube serves as a half-wave resonator. The fundamental wavelength λ, neglecting end effects, is approximately twice the length of the tube λ = 2 L. The Strouhal number of the fundamental frequency is hence given by Sr = πd L Ma. (9.01) Higher harmonics are integer multiples of this frequency. Although higher harmon- ics may occur, the focus is given to the fundamental mode only. The temporal evolution of acoustic pressure and velocity within one cycle is shown in Figure 9.02. In the first graph, fluid exits the resonator at both ends. The velocity is positive with respect to the spatial coordinate direction x in the upper half of the resonator and negative in the lower half. The pressure in the tube decreases until the acoustic velocity reverses. This leads to a rise in pressure and in turn to the flow reversing again which closes the circle. This can be depicted in frequency space as spatial distribution of the amplitude of pressure and velocity as well as the phase shift between both (cf. Figure 9.03). Mean Flow In addition to the existence of a standing wave, another prerequisite is mean flow through the tube. A constant stream through the tube removes hot fluid and trans- 9.01 Rijke Tube u′ p′ x Figure 9.02: Acoustic Pressure and Velocity in a Tube (Time Domain).Time domain representation of velocity oscillationsu′ (blue) and pressure oscillations p′ (red). One cycle is represented in eight steps corresponding to a phase difference of π/4 between each graph. Time advances from left to right (x ∈ [0,L]). ports cold fluid to the heater. This results in a convective heat transfer between wire mesh and working medium. In other thermoacoustic devices, like the thermoacous- tic engine, where no mean flow is present, this is facilitated by heat exchangers. The steady mean flow can either be forced by applying a pressure gradient or originate from buoyancy. In the first case, the Rijke tube is often arranged horizontally induc- ing the flow with a blower. Vertically arranged Rijke tubes usually rely on natural convection. In this case, hot fluid in the upper part of the tube has a lower density than the surroundings and is pulled upwards by buoyancy forces. This is counter- acted by hydraulic losses. The temperature and thus the density of the hot fluid are determined by the heating power and the enthalpy transport caused by the flow. In both cases, flow through the tube can be quantified by a mean velocity, i.e. a mean flow Reynolds number Re D = u 0,∞ D ν = Re 0 D d. (9.02) where D is the tube diameter. The flow is usually laminar or in the lower transitional regime. Thermoacoustic Instability If both prerequisites, resonator and (steady) heat transfer, are given, thermoacoustic instabilities may be excited. Rayleigh (Rayleigh, 1896) described this in what is now known as the Rayleigh criterion: If heat is added to a fluid parcel already compressed by the (acoustic) fluctuations, it will be compressed further. Thus, pressure fluctua- tions are amplified. In turn, if less heat is transferred to the fluid parcel during times of low pressure, i.e. compression by heating is comparatively small, pressure fluctua- 9 Aspects of Applications π/2 −π/2 u′p′ Figure 9.03: Acoustic Pressure and Velocity in a Tube (Frequency Domain).

This link between heat transfer and pressure demanding an in-phase behavior was later formalized as R I = ∮︂ p′Q̇ ′dt > 0. (9.03) R I is called the Rayleigh Index. In the case of the electrically heated Rijke tube, the heat flux Q̇ is given by Newton’ s law of cooling by Q̇ = Nuk d πd lw (Tw −T∞) (9.04) where lw is the length of the heated wire. Rearranging the definition of the transfer function of the heat transfer (Equation (2.0100)), the Nußelt number can be written as Nu = Nu (︃ 1 +GNu Re′ Re )︃. (9.05) Inserting Equation (9.05) in Equation (9.04) yields Q̇ = KQ (︃ 1 +GNu Re′ Re 0 )︃ (9.06) with the constant factor KQ = Nu 0 k πlw (Tw −T∞). Using only the fluctuating part of Equation (9.06), the Rayleigh integral can be rewritten to R I = KQ Re 0 ∮︂ p′GNu Re′dt. (9.07) The Reyleigh criterion reads then R I = ∮︂ p′GNu Re′dt > 0. (9.08) The Rayleigh criterion is a condition that is necessary, but not sufficient to cause instabilities. 9.01 Rijke Tube 0 0.05 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 4 4.05 5−0.005 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 Sr R I Figure 9.04: Normalized Rayleigh Index. Normalized RI computed for mean flow Reynolds numbers Re 0 ∈ {0.01, 0.02,0.04, 1, 2, 4, 10,20, 40} (blue to red). It is evident that the transfer function GNu is an important parameter for the stability of the Rijke tube. For the following investigation, only the upstream part of the Rijke tube, where the pressure lags behind the velocity by π/2 is considered. This corre- sponds to the configuration of most Rijke tube test rigs where the heater is located approximately 1/4 L from the inlet. However, this analysis can be made for the upper part with phase lag of −π/2 in an analogous manner. Without instantaneous heat transfer, the pressure and the velocity would be out of phase by π/2 resulting in R I = 0. Thus, neither infliction nor damping of thermoacoustic oscillations takes place. However, phase lag between pressure and heat transfer is π/2 + ∠GNu and hence the Rayleigh Index is positive if −π < ∠GNu < 0. To give a more detailed description, the Rayleigh Index is shown in Figure 9.04. It was computed for a series of mean flow Reynolds numbers in the range 0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40 and for Strouhal numbers in the range 0≤ Sr ≤ 5 with the transfer functions reported in Section 6.04.01. The amplitude of the oscillations in pressure and velocity (Reynolds number) were set to unity, so the depicted values can be seen as a normalized Rayleigh Index. The Rayleigh Index shows similar tendencies as the amplitude of the frequency re- sponse at a certain mean flow Reynolds number, but there are several important differences owed to the phase of GNu. At low mean flow Reynolds numbers, the highest values for R I occur at small values of Sr. The maximum shifts towards higher Strouhal numbers for higher mean flow Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the higher 9 Aspects of Applications gain values at larger mean flow Reynolds numbers lead to higher maximum values in R I. At low Strouhal numbers and Re 0 & 10, the Rayleigh Index is even negative due to the phase lead in the transfer function of the heat transfer. The chart in Figure 9.04 can serve as a design criterion to achieve the desired instability in a Rijke tube. A rough estimate for the Strouhal number at which the normalized Rayleigh Index is at a maximum for a specific Reynolds number in the range Re 0 ∈ [0.01, 40] can be given by Sr R I,max(Re 0) = 0.044 √︁ Re 0. (9.09) With this correlation, an optimal wire diameter in meters can be approximated with d ≈ 0.002 L Re L Ma 2, (9.010) where Re L denotes the Reynolds number evaluated with the tube length L as char- acteristic length. For a heater placed in the downstream half of the Rijke tube the plot in Figure 9.04 would be flipped at the abscissa. Hence, the heater dampens acoustic oscillations except for the case of Re 0 ≥ 10 and very low Strouhal numbers (Sr ≈ 0.005). 9.01.02 Significance of the Heat Transfer Model The normalized Rayleigh Index can be used to demonstrate the significance of the dynamic heat transfer model. Figure 9.05 shows the normalized Rayleigh Index com- puted for different heat transfer models. Results computed with the CFD/SI method are depiced with solid lines and the same coloring as in Figure 9.04. Additionally, the normalized Rayleigh Index was computed using the PT 1 model from Lighthill (dashed lines) and the n −τ model as used by Heckl (1988, dash–dotted lines). For the sake of completeness, the frequency responses of these models can be written as GNui,Lighthill = 0.05 1 +0.02 Sr and GNui,n−τ = n e−i 0.02 Sr. The range of Strouhal numbers was chosen to reflect the range found in the litera- ture survey in Section 3.06, where in most cases Sr ∈ [0.05, 8]. The Rayleigh Index is an indicator for the amplification of acoustic pulsations in the Rijke tube. Other losses that are not included here would virtually increase the threshold of positive amplification to values higher than R I = 0. The plot shows that for lower mean flow Reynolds numbers the maximum in R I is located at lower Strouhal numbers. The results computed with the PT 1 model by Lighthill and the n −τ model almost coincide due to the relationship between both models (cf. Section 8.01.03). Compared to the identified models,R I is drastically under-predicted. 9.01 Rijke Tube 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 Sr R I Figure 9.05: Comparison of the Normalized Rayleigh Index. Normalized RI from CFD/SI results for Re 0 = 0.04 ( ), Re 0 = 4 ( ), and Re 0 = 40 ( ), from Lighthill ( ) and from the n − −τ model ( ) as used e.g. by Heckl. Towards higher Reynolds numbers, the R I computed from the identified models is more similar to the PT 1 model by Lighthill and the n − τ model. However, only the identified models predict negative values of R I, which is due to the phase lead in the model. Above Sr = 3, the identified models for lower Reynolds numbers predict much lower values of R I than the PT 1 and the n −τ model. The identified model for Re 0 = 40 is fairly similar to Lighthill’ s PT 1 model. Then−τ model, however, drastically over-predicts R I. This analysis sheds new light on results obtained with previously published models, e.g. by Lighthill and Heckl and empha- sizes the significance of an accurate model for the heat transfer dynamics. 9.01.03 Justification of the Assumptions In this thesis, certain assumptions have been invoked a priori to solve the governing equations (cf. Section 2.02.05). These assumptions are justified for the flow conditions found in Rijke tubes. 9 Aspects of Applications Low Mach Number As can be seen from the Rayleigh Index in Figure 9.04, the transfer of thermal energy to acoustic energy is strongest at Strouhal numbers of order one for typical mean flow Reynolds numbers (0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40). With the relationship between Mach num- ber and Strouhal number given in Equation (9.01), the Mach number under these conditions is Ma ≈ πd L. (9.011) Usually, the wire diameter d is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the length of the resonator tube L. Hence, the Mach number is of order 10 −3, and the assumption of low Mach numbers is justified. Low Helmholtz Number In the case of a Rijke tube, the speed of sound is much larger than the free-stream velocity. Therefore, the Mach number is of order 10 −3. Indeed, even for moderate Strouhal numbers (Sr < 40 in the present study) the Helmholtz number is also small He = Sr Ma ≪ 1. Thus, the region of heat transfer is “acoustically compact”, i.e. its length is much smaller than the acoustic wavelength (Rienstra and Hirschberg, 2015; Telionis, 1981). This implies that an incompressible flow model is adequate. Low Eckert Number Lange et al gave a relation between Nußelt number and viscous heating. The Nußelt number is corrected by ∆Nu Nu 0 = 0.04 Ec. (9.012) However, as it was established that Ec ∼ Ma 2, viscous heating does not have a sub- stantial influence in the case of the Rijke tube. Overheating The influence of the temperature difference (or overheating)∆T is neglected in this work to ensure comparability to analytical methods. The influence in the steady state can be estimated from the correction factor of Nußelt number correlations. Collis and Williams (cf. Equation (2.023)) gave the correction factor (Tm/T∞)0.017, where Tm stands for the arithmetic mean between the temperature 9.01 Rijke Tube of the cylinder and the inbound fluid with T∞. This factor accounts for the tem- perature dependence of fluid properties like viscosity and thermal conductivity. It can be rewritten as [1 +∆T /(2 T∞)]0.017 indicating that low temperature differences between fluid and cylinder have negligible effect on the Nußelt number, e.g. for wire temperatures of ∆T = 200 K above a fluid temperature of T∞ = 300 K this term enlarges the Nußelt number by only 5% and less than 11% for ∆T = 500 K. In the correlation by Sparrow et al (cf. Equation (2.024)), the correction fac- tor is (µ/µw )1/4. The temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity is given by Sutherland’ s law (Equation (2.033)). This results in a Nußelt number reduced by 8.08 % for ∆T = 300 K and 15.05 % for∆T = 500 K at an ambient temperature of 300 K. Constant Wall Temperature Heat conduction in the cylinder was not resolved. Instead, a constant temperature Tw on the surface of the cylinder was assumed. This assumption is also justified for Rijke tubes (Gelbert et al, 2012; Subramanian et al, 2010). A lumped thermal capacitance model (Baehr and Stephan, 2011; Bergman et al, 2011) is applicable, if the Biot number is much smaller than one Bi ≪ 1. The Biot number is linked to the Nußelt number by Bi = Nu ·k f /(2 ks ) and thus correlates with Reynolds number by Equation (2.023) or Equation (2.024). For combinations of wire material and fluid that are common in practice as well as mean flow Reynolds numbers typical for Rijke tubes, the Nußelt numbers are of order one and the Biot numbers the order 10 −3, as shown in Table 9.01. Hence, a lumped thermal capacitance model may be applied with excellent accuracy, implying a spatially homogeneous temperature within the cylinder. The equation for a lumped thermal capacitance (Bergman et al, 2011) is given by Vs ρs cp,s ∂T ∂t = h As (T −T∞), (9.013) where Vs and As denote the volume and surface area, respectively. This equation can also be deduced from Equation (2.065) with Newton’ s law of cooling as a bound- ary condition. Introducing the cylindrical geometry and the definition of the Nußelt number, the time constantτwire for this first order differential equation can be given as τwire = d 2ρs cp,s 4 Nuk f. (9.014) Typical values for the time constant are given in Table 9.01. 9 Aspects of Applications Quantity Value d 0.0001 m ρs 19.025 ×103 kg/m 3 cp,s 138 J/(kg K) k f 0.00262 W/(m K) νf 1.057 ×10−5 m 2/s Re 0 0.01 – 40 Nu 0.044 – 3.02 τwire ∼ 57.08 s – 8.00 s Src ∼ 0.0011 – 0.0000 21 Table 9.01: Exemplary Properties and Conditions for a Heated Wire in a Rijke Tube. The material properties are those of pure tungsten. A cutoff Strouhal number Sr c for temperature pulsations of the wire can be calcu- lated from Src = 4 k f νf ρs cs Nu Re 0. (9.015) This shows that the temperature of the cylinder reacts to very low frequencies, but thermal inertia is too high at Strouhal numbers of order unity and above to substan- tially change due to pulsations of the flow crossflow. Natural convection If the Rijke tube is mounted vertically, the mean flow is driven solely by natural con- vection. This mean flow velocity establishing in the resonator tube can readily be converted to a Reynolds number. In the case of a horizontal Rijke tube, the forced convection in horizontal direction may superimpose with natural convection in a direction perpendicular to the tube axis and thus mixed convection occurs. The Richardson number is a measure for the relative strength of natural convection. It is given by Ri = Gr Re 2 (9.016) where the Grashof number is defined as Gr ≡ d 3 g βref (Tw −Tstat) ν2 ref. (9.017) Natural convection is negligible for Ri < 0.01. For Ri > 10, natural convection is dom- inant and forced convection may be neglected. In the intermediate region, mixed 9.01 Rijke Tube convection should be considered (Schlichting and Gersten, 2006). According to Lange et al, the influence of natural convection is negligible, if Re ≥ 2 Gr 1/2. In the Rijke tube, another factor comes into play. No net flux of fluid can occur in the direction perpendicular to the tube axis, i.e. it cannot penetrate the solid tube material. Hence, mixed convection effects are neglected in this thesis. Radiative Heat Transfer Radiative heat transfer was neglected in the simulations. This has two main reasons: (1) The working gas, which is air for most Rijke tubes, is transparent for radiation at wavelengths corresponding to typical wire temperatures. (2) Differences between wire temperature and ambient temperature were assumed to be small in the nu- merical procedure. Nevertheless, Kopitz showed, that radiative heat transfer it not negligible concerning the overall heat transfer in the Rijke tube. In his experiments, there was significant energy exchange between the heater and the tube wall. This impeded temperature measurements and caused heat-up of the whole tube. 9.01.04 Limitations In this thesis, the heat transfer dynamics of a Rijke tube were investigated by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for just one isolated wire. Thus, this method causes the following limitations. Overheating In a real Rijke tube, a certain amount of thermal power has to be introduced in order to overcome the hydraulic losses and achieve a limit cycle. Hence, the temperature of the wire has to be substantially higher than the ambient temperature. The as- sumption of low temperature differences is violated. It was, however, established in Section 8.03.02 that the dynamic behavior does not change fundamentally and some correction, e.g. the use of an effective mean flow Reynolds number, copes with this shortcoming. High Amplitudes The linear regime only describes the onset of thermoacoustic oscillations in the Rijke tube. At higher amplitudes, the nonlinearity of the heat transfer plays an im- 9 Aspects of Applications portant role, but it cannot be handled accurately by a linear model. Nevertheless, as shown in Section 8.03.03, the dynamics are still represented adequately to some extent even at pulsation amplitudes in the order of the mean flow velocity. Non-Uniformity A constant velocity profile is used in the CFD computations for a single wire. How- ever, in the resonator tube, a boundary layer will establish, leading to a character- istic velocity profile. This is not so much of concern for a single wire, because the wire diameter is usually much smaller than the tube diameter d ≪ D. Yet, different wires placed at a different distance from the cylinder axis experience different mean flow velocities and therefore locally different Reynolds numbers and Strouhal num- bers. Moreover, oscillations in the Rijke tube do not only scale the velocity profile in the tube but also interact with the boundary layer at the tube wall and introduce additional dynamics. Wire Pattern As the last limitation, the isolated wire has to be mentioned. To introduce the nec- essary amount of thermal energy, the heated wire has to be inserted in the tube as a coil or some sort of repeating pattern. This also means that the wires interact with each other. If the distance of the wires in lateral direction is large enough, however, this interaction is negligible. Usually, this distance is several wire diameters and fulfilling the far field requirement. A different picture can be drawn in the case of successive wires where one wire is in the (thermal) wake of the other. A simulation was conducted at a mean flow Reynolds number of Re 0 = 3 with two successive wires at a distance of 10 d. The transfer function of the second wire was of the same shape as that of the first, but the amplitude values were about 10 % to 20% smaller. This is due to the fact that the fluid arriving at the second cylinder is hotter, and hence the amount of heat transferred is smaller. The basic behavior of the heat transfer, however, is still the same as for a single wire. 9.02 Hot-Wire Anemometry Hot-wire anemometry is used to measure velocities in laminar and turbulent flows for a wide range of velocities. A thin, electrically heated wire, mounted on prongs, is placed in the flow as a probe. An advantage of this method is that very small probes allow determining flow velocities very accurately at a specific position.

Hot-wire devices can be classi- fied as CCA (constant current anemometer), CVA (constant voltage anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer) (Bruun, 1996). In the first method, changes in the wire temperature lead to changes in electrical resistance. To keep the current constant, a change in voltage is necessary and serves as a measure of the flow velocity. Similarly, in the CVA method, changes in electrical current at constant voltage are measured. The most accurate and most widely used method is CTA. In the CTA method, a controller holds the temperature of the heated wire constant. The voltage necessary to do so is again linked to the flow velocity that is to be measured. 9.02.02 Justification of Assumptions For constant temperature anemometry, the electric current delivered by the power amplifier is controlled to maintain a constant wire temperature, so the assumption of constant surface temperature Tw is valid by design. Moreover, wire diameters are very small, and hence Helmholtz numbers are small. A low Mach number is, however, not a necessary condition for hot-wire anemom- etry. On the contrary, this method is often used to examine high-velocity flows. Table 9.02 gives exemplary properties and conditions for a hot-wire probe made of platinum (Bruun, 1996). 9 Aspects of Applications 9.02.03 Fluctuation of Angle of Attack Hot-wire anemometers are often used to measure velocities in strongly turbulent environments. Turbulence, as detailed in Section 2.01.03, includes chaotic three di- mensional fluctuations in velocity. This causes not only changes in the magnitude of the flow velocity but also fluctuations in the angle of attack. A fluctuating angle of attack was also mentioned by Lighthill in his original article as a vantage point for future investigations. Mechler, in his bachelor’ s thesis supervised by the author of this thesis, fo- cused on changes in the angle of attack in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder α. The simulations were carried out on a similar setup as detailed in Section 5.01 and Section 5.02. At the inlet the velocity was excited with fluctuations in x- and y-direction. Fluctuations in velocity parallel to the inlet boundary propagate not with the speed of sound, which is infinite in the incompressible formulation used here, but with the convective velocity. This effect is similar to the shear waves described in Section 3.01.02. It poses a difficulty in the data acquisition as the signal imposed at the inlet decouples. Two changes were implemented in the computa- tional procedure to minimize this effect: The domain boundary was chosen circular so with any inflow angle the face normals of the inlet point towards the cylinder. The second change concerned the position of the data acquisition plane. It was located as close to the cylinder as possible to acquire the actual input accurately. Velocity fluctuations, i.e. Reynolds number fluctuations, and fluctuations in the an- gle of attack influence the heat transfer. Hence, the system is of MISO type, and an according model had to be identified. The identification yielded two transfer functions, which in sum determine the Nußelt number fluctuations. The dynamic influence of Reynolds number fluctuations on Nußelt number fluctuations GRe is expected to be the same as GNu in Section 6.03. The transfer behavior between the angle of attack and the Nußelt number Gα shows a low gain at high frequencies where the boundary layer cannot adapt to the fast changes in the flow. In the quasi- steady limit, the adaption occurs instantly, and no change in heat transfer occurs. However, at reasonably low frequencies changes in the boundary layer affect the Nußelt number. The relative influence of both fluctuations, Reynolds number fluctuations and fluc- tuations in the angle of attack, is determined by standardization of all quantities. From the standardized transfer functions conclusions can be drawn on how much of the variance in Nußelt number is explained by either Re ′ or α′. A standardized quantity has zero mean and a variance of unity. The quantities Re ′, Nu ′, and α′ already fulfill the first requirement. The mean value was subtracted in the post- processing of the data series. The second requirement was achieved by dividing the 9.02 Hot-Wire Anemometry 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 |GRe|, |Gα| 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40-π -π/2 π/2 π Sr ∠ GRe, ∠ Gα Figure 9.06: Frequency Response of Heat Transfer to Re and Angle of Attack.

The input-output relation with standardized quantities is thus given by Nu′ σNu = Nu Re G∗ Re Re′ σRe + Nu α G∗ α α′ σα (9.018) with the scaled transfer functions G∗ Re and G∗ α for Reynolds number and angle of attack, respectively. To achieve the original scaling for the transfer function from Re′ to Nu′ G = σNu σRe G∗ (9.019) is used. Hence, Equation (9.018) can be written as Nu′ = Nu Re GRe Re′ + Nu α Gαα′ σRe σα. (9.020) Figure 9.06 depicts the frequency response of the identified MISO model. 9.02.04 Interactions of Dynamic Subsystems In hot-wire anemometry, not only the dynamics of the fluid are of interest, but also the solid wire and possibly a controller. Both can be characterized by their frequency 9 Aspects of Applications response as well. The wire can be modeled as a first order time lag (lumped capaci- tance) model with time constant cτ,s (cf. Equation 9.014). As a possible controller, a critically damped second order time lag model with a cutoff frequency of 55 k Hz is assumed. This represents typical values for CTA (Bruun, 1996). The natural frequency can be brought into the dimensionless framework by Sr = f 2πd 2 Re 0 ν. (9.021) Figure 9.07 shows the amplitude of the frequency responses in a Bode diagram in a log–log plot. This format was chosen to display a wide range of frequencies. The values were assessed for a wire probe made of platinum and air at ambient condi- tions. The mean flow Reynolds number is Re 0 = 40. The cutoff Strouhal number of the CTA controller depends on the wire diameter and was evaluated for d = 5µm. Thicker wires would only affect the graph of the CTA and place the cutoff frequency further to the right. Heat conduction and storage in the solid wire are comparatively slow processes which can be seen by the low cutoff Strouhal number of the wire itself. Both the response to velocity magnitude fluctuations and fluctuations in the angle of attack can be considered quasi-stationary in this frequency range. This is also mostly true if the CTA controller is considered. Peak and drop in the gain of GRe are well beyond the operating range of the controller for very thin wires. The influence of the angle of attack is negligible in the low-frequency limit. The boundary layer adapts to slow changes in the angle of attack comparably fast and therefore the gain is zero. The influence of the angle of attack becomes stronger towards the cutoff frequency of the controller. The rise in gain is about one order of magnitude. This effect would even be stronger if thicker wires were considered and the peak gain of Gα is in the pass-band of the controller. Towards even higher frequencies, the inertia of the fluid leads to a band-pass-like behavior as visible in Figure 9.07. The comparison between the frequency ranges of the wire and the CTA controller with the frequency responses of the heat transfer fluctuations to pulsations in ap- proaching flow velocity and angle of attack shows that anemometers operate mostly in the quasi-steady limit. Hence, the heat transfer dynamics play only a minor role. Only the response to fluctuations in the angle of attack starts to come into effect within the operating range of the CTA controller. However, the amplitude of the fre- quency response is small, and anemometers are usually not used for measurements at such high frequencies. 9.03 Heat Exchanger in Domestic Boilers 10−5 10−4 10−3 10−2 10−1 100 101 102 103−60 −50 −40 −30 −20 −10 Sr |GRe|, |Gα| in d B Figure 9.07: Frequency Response Magnitudes for Hot-Wire Anemometry.

Recently, the effect of an HX on thermoacoustic combustion instabilities in a heating system was investigated by Surendran and Heckl (2014, 2015). In these studies, the so-called n − τ model was used to describe unsteady heat transfer. This model corresponds to the low- frequency limit of Lighthill’ s results for heat transfer in pulsating crossflow: A charac- teristic time delay τ leads to a linearly growing phase lag in the frequency response. This approach is simple and quite popular but does not give a realistic description of the dynamics. The HX in crossflow itself is much like the configuration investigated in this thesis, in particular, a low-pass behavior is obtained. However, the interactions between consecutive elements of an HX have a significant impact on its response function (Strobio Chen et al, 2015). Combinations of HX and flames, as found in configura- tions of applied interest, were investigated with respect to the dynamic heat transfer behavior from a hydrodynamic and thermoacoustic point of view by Hosseini et al (2014 b,a) and from a system point of view by Strobio Chen et al (Strobio Chen et al, 2016). Surendran et al determined the frequency response function of the HX in this configuration from the discrete Fourier transform of the response of the 9 Aspects of Applications heat transfer rate to a step input, which was determined by numerical simulation. The HX is principally very similar to the (isolated) cylinder assessed in this thesis. However, some differences arise, which are addressed in the following. 9.03.01 Temperature Difference The temperature difference between inflow and outflow of the HX and the resulting change in fluid properties play an important role in quantifying the dynamic be- havior. The qualitative behavior, however, is very similar to the heated cylinder. The most substantial difference is the arrangement. In the case of the cylinder, one bluff body is singled out surrounded by a theoretically infinite amount of fluid. The HX, in contrast, consists of tightly wound coils with only small clearances between the exchanger pipes. A specifically determined amount of fluid passes through, trans- ferring its excess in enthalpy to the fluid in the exchanger tubes. This especially impacts the quasi-steady behavior, i.e. the low-frequency limit. 9.03.02 Low Frequency Limit Heat transfer between a surface and a convective flow can be described by Newton’ s law of cooling (Bergman et al, 2011) given by q̇ = h(Tw −T∞). (9.022) In the isolated wire configuration (Rijke tube) addressed in this thesis, the enthalpy change of the flow is insignificant. Both temperatures Tw and T∞ are constant. The low-frequency limit is determined by the heat transfer coefficient h, i.e. the Nußelt number. This is different in the case of the HX. The initially large temperature differ- ence (Tw −T∞) between HX surface and passing flow diminishes along the exhaust gas path until it almost vanishes. This is necessary to achieve high efficiencies. The low-frequency limit, in this case, is controlled by the enthalpy difference rather than the heat transfer. The heat transferred in the HX is given by q̇ = uρcp (Tu −Td ) (9.023) where Tu and Td are the fluid temperatures upstream and downstream of the HX. Asymptotic expansion of velocity u, downstream temperature Td, and density ρ yields q̇ 0 +ϵq̇ ′ = cp (u 0 +ϵu′)(ρ0 +ϵρ′) (︁ Tu −(Td,0 +ϵT ′ d ) )︁. (9.024) To leading order, Equation (9.024) is recovered with u 0, ρ0, and Td,0. Collecting the terms of first order in ϵ yields q′ = cp [︁ (Tuu 0 −Td,0 u 0)ρ′ +(Tuρ0 −Td,0ρ0)u′ −u 0ρ0 Td ′]︁. (9.025) 9.03 Heat Exchanger in Domestic Boilers Assuming ρ′ = 0 and inserting in the definition of the transfer function (Equa- tion (2.0100)) leads to KNu =GNu(Sr = 0) = u 0 u′ cp [︁ (Tuρ0 −Td,0ρ0)u′ −u 0ρ0 Td ′]︁ u 0ρ0 cp (Tu −Td,0) = 1 − u 0 u′ Td ′ Tu −Td,0. (9.026) The downstream temperature can be inferred from a local balance. For reasons of simplicity, a constant distances between two successive tubes is assumed. The tem- perature is given by Td = Tw +(Tu −Tw )exp (︃ −h L ρu s cp )︃. (9.027) Using the definition of the Nußelt number leads to Td = Tw +(Tu −Tw )exp (︃ −Nuk L 2ρu s 2 cp )︃. (9.028) Assuming that fluctuations in temperature are only caused by velocity fluctuations, it may be argued that T can be approximated by a Taylor series T (u 0 +ϵu′) = T (u 0) + d T du 0 ϵu′ +O(2) = T 0 +ϵT ′. (9.029) The derivative of Td with respect to u 0 is given by d T d du 0 = Nuk L 2ρu 2 0 s 2 cp (Tu −Tw ) exp (︃ −Nuk L 2ρu 0 s 2 cp )︃. (9.030) Finally, the expression Td ′ = Nuk L 2ρu 2 0 s 2 cp (Tu −Tw ) exp (︃ −Nuk L 2ρu 0 s 2 cp )︃ u′ (9.031) can be given for the downstream temperature fluctuation. Combining Equation (9.031) and Equation (9.026) yields KNu = 1 − u 0 Tu −Td,0 Nuk L 2ρu 2 0 s 2 cp (Tu −Tw ) exp (︃ Nuk L 2ρu 0 s 2 cp )︃ (9.032) for the low frequency limit. 9 Aspects of Applications Quantity Value Upstream Downstream Nu 7.054 L 0.0036 m s 0.08 ×10−3 m k 0.00764 W/(m K) 0.00262 W/(m K) ρ 0.029 kg/m 3 1.018 kg/m 3 u 0 14 m/s 3.05 m/s cp 1175 J/(kg K) 1005 J/(kg K) Table 9.03: Exemplary Properties and Conditions for a Heat Exchanger.

Two of which are the improvement of exist- ing devices and the development of new technologies with high potentiality. This thesis strives to aid this process through the following findings. 10.01 Summary The dynamic response of the heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsat- ing crossflow were investigated for small perturbations of flow velocity. The cycle- averaged heat transfer is independent of the fluctuations such that pulsations of flow variables can be described as LTI systems. The foundation of this study was time series data acquired from CFD simulations of a single cylinder in crossflow solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The assumptions leading to this simplified treatment are justified for the application that was the primary mo- tivation for this thesis: the Rijke tube. The numerical procedure was designed and examined thoroughly to yield optimal results regarding the desired dynamic behav- ior. The dynamic behavior was quantified by transfer functions. These are models in the framework of LTI systems known from control theory and electrical engineer- ing. Three fundamentally different ways—with the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations as the only commonality—were implemented and compared. Transfer functions were developed from the response to a sudden rise in input velocity (step response), from a frequency domain approach, where perturbations are linearized and solved with finite differences (LNSE), and from time domain simulations with broadband excitation (CFD/SI). For the latter, discrete time identification and con- tinuous time identification were considered. The results are in excellent agreement for all simulation and identification methods for mean flow Reynolds numbers of Re 0 ≤ 40. The CFD/SI approach offers more variability, as it does not rely on the existence of a steady state. Several improvements were easily possible such as the extension to the regime of vortex shedding and transition to turbulence in the wake Re 0 > 40. Continuous time identification and discrete time identification yielded compara- ble results as long as disturbances were well-behaved. However, in the cases where 10 Conclusions and Outlook vortex shedding occurs, and a strong tonal component is present in the noise, the OE model structure from the discrete time framework can readily be extended to a BJ model with a parametrization of the disturbance. In addition to the assessment of model types and parameter estimation methods, other advanced identification techniques, e.g. regularization and uncertainty quantification, were surveyed. The results of the investigations were tabulated and depicted as Bode plots of the frequency responses. The heat transfer dynamics and the skin friction dynamics are governed by several time scales, corresponding to the response times of the velocity field and temperature field, respectively. The interaction of the different time lags leads to a non-trivial dependence of the respective frequency responses on Strouhal numbers and mean flow Reynolds numbers. The transfer behavior of the heat transfer appears like a low-pass filter with one dominant time scale, similar to the analytical predictions by Lighthill or Bayly. However, several devia- tions from this behavior were found and explained, most notably the occurrence of a peak gain at 0 < Sr < 1 and the phase values at very high frequencies. The skin fric- tion, in contrast, behaves like a high-pass filter. A strong dependence on the mean flow Reynolds number exists which is not present in the existing analytical models by Lighthill and Gersten. Unification in the manner of a Reynolds analogy is not possible in the dynamic case. The present study represents also a significant advancement over previous computational studies (Apelt and Ledwich, 1979; Kwon and Lee, 1985; Nicoli and Pelcé, 1989; Payne, 1958; Föller et al, 2008). In particular, the time lag, which is of paramount importance for thermoacoustic stability in a Rijke tube, is determined with quantitative accuracy. The advantage of CFD simulations is complete access to the flow field at any instant in time. This is used to examine the evolution of the near field of the cylinder in unprecedented detail. Step response simulations and the results from the LNSE approach allow insight in the temporal development and the behavior in the fre- quency domain, respectively. This was also used to show detailed circumferential distributions of the Nußelt number fluctuations and friction coefficient fluctuations at different excitation frequencies. To make the results from this thesis readily available in tasks like the modeling of a Rijke tube, a first order parametrized model was developed. The model includes the dependence of the transfer behavior on Strouhal number and Reynolds number and can be used in the range 0.01 ≤ Re 0 ≤ 40 and 0 < Sr ≤ 40. The steady-state gain and the time constant are given as correlations developed from the complete series of simulations in the regime without vortex shedding. Three applications are investigated in the scope of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow: The Rijke tube, hot-wire anemometry, and an HX as an acoustic element. Special consideration was given to the Rijke tube, and the transfer functions developed in this thesis were related to the stability of thermoacoustic oscillations in the tube. For 10.02 Implications for Further Research the hot-wire anemometer, an additional fact was investigated. A fluctuating angle of attack, which originates from turbulent fluctuations of the flow to be measured, has some impact on the heat transfer dynamics and therefore on the measurement. 10.02 Implications for Further Research Further investigations will address gas turbines as well as the Rijke tube as a proto- type of a thermoacoustic device. Moreover, machinery exploiting the thermoacous- tic effect, e.g. thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators, will profit from the results and methods assessed in this study. Although high amplitudes, and therefore the nonlinear heat transfer dynamics, play a vital role in this type of device, linear stabil- ity (or instability) is still a primary design criterion. Thermoacoustic prime movers are of interest, e.g. for the power generation from waste heat (Witte et al, 2015). High efficiency is of secondary importance compared to acquisition costs and service costs. These devices are predestined for this task as they are simple to build and very robust in operation once they are adequately designed. This argument also applies to thermoacoustic refrigerators. They may be used where robustness is a crucial requirement as they can be built with no moving parts. This gives these devices an advantage over conventional compression refrigerators even though the latter offer much higher efficiencies. Recent investigations in thermoacoustic devices in- clude the possibilities to incorporate thermoacoustic prime movers or refrigerators in other assemblies. One aspect that has been studied in the past was the influence of mean flow inside the device (Holzinger et al, 2012, 2015). Such a configuration, in turn, is similar to the Rijke tube. Thermoacoustic devices are in need of much more robust design tools and smart concepts for integration in machinery that supplies heat or acoustic energy. Although linear models, such as those assessed in this study, offer a great deal of insight and the possibility to investigate linear stability, the nonlinear behavior has to be subject to further investigations. A system may be linearly stable but nonlinear or non-normal effects may trigger high amplitudes. Moreover, if high amplitudes are desired, linear models often seize to be valid and can at most predict the coarse behavior but usually fail to recover correct amplitudes or power output. Another application with cylinders subject to pulsating flow, which is of interest for future investigations is the total artificial lung (TAL). The TAL is a device still under development, and it aims to replace all functions of a human lung, i.e. to remove CO 2 from blood and to supply it with oxygen (O 2). To achieve this, the (pulsatile) blood flow passes small tubes from which the mass transfer occurs. Lin et al studied these mass transfer effects in a water tunnel at very low Reynolds numbers. Numerical investigations were carried out by Zierenberg et al (2006, 2007, 5 ≤ Re ≤ 40,0.025 ≤ Wo ≤ 4, 0.025 ≤ A ≤ 0.075, Sc = 1000), Qamar et al (2011, 0.033 < KC < 1, 10 Conclusions and Outlook 0.05 d < A < d, 5 < Re < 20), and Qamar et al (2012, 0.02 ≤ A ≤ 0.06, 0.057 ≤ KC ≤ 2, Re = 5, 10). The flow conditions examined in these studies are not unlike to the range of interest in this thesis. The Reynolds numbers are in the range 1 ≤ Re ≤ 50 and the fluid is incompressible. The largest difference is the high Schmidt number (Sc = 1000) which is much larger than the ratio of transport properties considered in this thesis which mainly focuses on air (Pr = 0.07). Besides the cylinder, another archetypal problem in thermo-fluid dynamics is a sphere in crossflow. CFD/SI methods or the LNSE can be used to investigate the impact of pulsations on the skin friction and the heat transfer. The skin friction plays an important role in the movement of small spherical particles or droplets. The movement can be described by a force balance including effects like inertia, virtual mass, and fluid drag. The latter has a “history” that has to be considered due to the dynamics of the skin friction. This history force, often called Basset force, can be identified from numerical simulations in a similar manner as the friction coefficient. The major difference is the dependence on flow acceleration instead of velocity like in this thesis. The Basset force plays an important role in the case of continuous acceleration, e.g. under the influence of gravity or in the case of droplets oscillating in an acoustic field. Moreover, the heat transfer between a droplet and the surrounding fluid plays a role in the evaporation of liquid fuels, and the heat transfer dynamics can influence the spray combustion process. A topic explicitly excluded in this thesis are state space models. These models exist besides input–output models and have certain desirable properties, especially in conjunction with computational methods and systems with a large number of in- puts and outputs. The models reported in this thesis can easily be transformed into state space models. However, in the field of SI, useful methods like balanced trunca- tion model reduction and model order identification exist, which makes the direct identification of state space models an exciting topic for further investigations. This thesis offers detailed models for the behavior of heat transfer and skin friction of a cylinder in pulsating crossflow. Moreover, a comprehensive procedure is given to acquire accurate results at flow conditions not investigated in detail in this thesis. The reported results allow the development of models with different levels of detail in investigations, e.g. of the thermoacoustic effect in the Rijke tube. Findings con- cerning the field of thermoacoustic can be transferred to other devices. On the one hand to help suppress thermoacoustic instabilities and ensure proper performance, e.g. in the case of stationary gas turbines for power generation or in domestic boilers. On the other hand, the thermoacoustic effect may be used purposefully in devices, e.g. in thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators. The ultimate goal is to contribute to maintaining the standard of living that was granted by the devices mentioned above, while most importantly reducing the toll on the environment. Specifically, to reduce noxious emissions like NOx and small particles as well as greenhouse gases like CO 2. 10.02 Implications for Further Research Supervised Theses Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation entstanden an der Professur für Thermofluiddy- namik der Technischen Universität München in den Jahren 2013 bis 2017 unter wesentlicher wissenschaftlicher, fachlicher und inhaltlicher Anleitung des Autors die im Folgenden aufgeführten studentischen Arbeiten.

In particular, it focuses on the following aspects: high-ﬁdelity ﬂuid dynamic simulati ons, gathering in-depth knowl- edge about the mechanisms involved and data-based reduced- order modeling. Compressible ﬂuid dynamic simulations are conducted for th e nonlinear aeroacoustic char- acterization. These simulations are acoustically excited at an inlet boundary with the Navier-Stokes characteristics boundary condition. The com putational setup is success- fully validated against experiments for various test cases. In addition, a novel method- ology applying incompressible ﬂow simulations is develope d and cross-validated against compressible simulations. The validated compressible computational setup is employed as a powerful tool to investi- gate nonlinear eﬀects in detail. The eﬀects of the resonator edge contour on the damping behavior are analyzed. It is demonstrated that a blunt edge r educes the ﬂow separation at the leading edge signiﬁcantly, resulting in a reduction o f the nonlinear resistance. Fur- thermore, the scattering to higher harmonics is investigat ed in the nonlinear regime. For the Helmholtz resonator, a pattern in the spectrum of the scat tered wave is found, where only the odd harmonics are present. A quasi-steady analysis identiﬁes the ﬂow symmetry during the inﬂow and the outﬂow phase as the reason for this pa ttern. Accordingly, the pattern becomes weaker for a Helmholtz resonator with an asym metric neck and vanishes totally for a quarter-wave resonator. Moreover, it is shown that the overall scattering to higher harmonics remains on minor and moderate levels for th e Helmholtz and quarter- wave resonator, respectively. Data-based reduced-order modeling of the dynamics of resonators forms the core of the thesis. For that purpose, system identiﬁcation techniques are applied on broadband in- put/output data from a ﬂuid dynamic simulation. The linear d ynamics are reproduced very accurately by an estimated linear autoregressive mode l. Such a model can be rep- resented as a digital ﬁlter with an inﬁnite number of ﬁlter co eﬃcients. Since the autore- gressive model exhibits a moderate number of free model para meters, it is robust against over-ﬁtting. This methodology is extended into the nonline ar regime. A novel gray-box model structure, named local-linear neuro-fuzzy network, is proposed along with a proce- dure for a bias-free identiﬁcation. This model—deﬁned in th e time domain—reproduces the nonlinear dynamics accurately in a robust manner by an es timation based on data from a single simulation. Since this model is very ﬂexible an d can be evaluated eﬃciently, iii it can be employed as an acoustic boundary condition in other ﬂuid dynamic or aeroa- coustic simulations for the assessment of the nonlinear sta bility of the overall system. Moreover, the eﬃcient and robust nonlinear characterizati on makes this approach feasible to support the resonator design in an early stage of developm ent. iv Kurzfassung Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit den nichtlinearen D¨ampfungseigenschaften akustischer Resonatoren wie z. B. λ/4- und Helmholtzresonatoren, die aufgrund von Str ¨omungsabl¨osung an den Resonatorenkanten bei hohen akustischen Ampli- tuden auftreten. Insbesondere werden folgende Aspekte betr achtet: die akkurate str¨omungsmechanische Simulation, die Vertiefung des Kenntni sstandes ¨uber die auftre- tenden Mechanismen und die datengest ¨utzte Generierung von Modellen reduzierter Ord- nung. F¨ur die nichtlineare aeroakustische Charakterisierung wer den kompressible str¨omungsmechanische Simulationen durchgef ¨uhrt. Diese Simulationen werden am Einlass, an dem die Navier-Stokes-Characteristics-Randbe dingung implementiert ist, akustisch angeregt. Das numerische Setup wird erfolgreich anhand von Experimenten f¨ur verschiedene Testf ¨alle validiert. Zudem wird eine neue Methode, basierend auf inkompressibler Simulationen, entwickelt und an kompress ible Simulationen validiert. Das validierte kompressible Setup wird eingesetzt, um nich tlineare Eﬀekte im De- tail zu untersuchen. Zun ¨achst wird die Auswirkung der Resonatorkantenkontur auf die D ¨ampfungseigenschaften analysiert. Es wird gezeigt, dass e ine stumpfe Kante die Str¨omungsabl¨osung an der Vorderkante erheblich reduziert, was zu einer V erringerung des nichtlinearen Widerstandes f ¨uhrt. Zudem wird die Streuung in Oberschwingungen im nichtlinearen Regime untersucht. F ¨ur den Helmholtzresonator wird ein Muster im Spek- trum der reﬂektierten Welle sichtbar, in dem ausschließlic h die ungeradzahligen Ober- schwingungen vorhanden sind. Als Ursache hierf ¨ur wird in einer quasi-station ¨aren Ana- lyse die Str ¨omungssymmetrie w ¨ahrend der Ein- und Ausstr ¨omphase ermittelt. Dement- sprechend wird das Muster f ¨ur einen Helmholtzresonator mit einem asymmetrischen Hals schw¨acher und verschwindet vollst ¨andig f ¨ur einen λ/4-Resonator. Dar ¨uber hinaus wird gezeigt, dass die gesamte Streuung zu Oberschwingungen auf kleinem Niveau f ¨ur den Helmholtzresonator bzw. einem moderatem f ¨ur den λ/4-Resonator verbleibt. Die datengest ¨utzte Modellierung der Resonatordynamik bildet den Kern di eser Arbeit. Hierf¨ur werden Systemidentiﬁkationstechniken auf breitbandig e Ein- und Ausgangsdaten einer str¨omungsmechanischen Simulation angewendet. Die lineare Dy namik wird durch ein gesch¨atztes lineares autoregressives Modell sehr genau wiederg egeben. Ein solches Modell kann als digitaler Filter mit unendlich vielen Filterkoeﬃzie nten dargestellt werden. Da das autoregressive Modell nur eine geringe Anzahl an freien Mode llparametern aufweist, ist es robust gegen ¨uber Over-Fitting. Diese Methodik wird in das nichtlineare R egime ausge- dehnt. Eine neue Gray-Box-Modellstruktur, ein sogenannte s lokal-lineares Neuro-Fuzzy- v Netzwerk, wird zusammen mit einer Prozedur f ¨ur eine biasfreie Identiﬁkation entwickelt. Dieses im Zeitbereich deﬁnierte Modell reproduziert robus t die nichtlineare Dynamik ba- sierend auf Daten einer einzigen Simulation. Aufgrund seine r Flexibilit ¨at und eﬃzienten Auswertbarkeit kann es als akustische Randbedingung in str ¨omungsmechanischen oder ae- roakustichen Simulationen zur Beurteilung der nichtlinea ren Stabilit¨at des Gesamtsystems eingesetzt werden. Dar ¨uber hinaus kann dieser Ansatz durch die eﬃziente und robuste nichtlineare Charakterisierung den Auslegungsprozess von Resonatoren bereits zu einem fr¨uhen Entwicklungsstadium unterst ¨utzen. vi Vorwort Die vorliegende Arbeit entstand am Fachgebiet f¨ur Thermoﬂuiddynamik der Technischen Universit¨at M ¨unchen w ¨ahrend meiner T ¨atigkeit als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter.

For in- stance, they are implemented to reduce sound emissions to th e environment or to suppress thermoacoustic oscillations. Combustion systems, suc h as domestic heaters, gas tur- bines or rocket engines, may suﬀer from so-called thermoaco ustic instabilities. These instabilities can occur due to the feedback of the combustio n process and the acoustics within the system. By a ﬂuctuating heat release from the combu stion, the gaseous vol- ume is thermally expanded in an unsteady manner which produc es sound. This sound is reﬂected at the combustion chamber boundaries and, in turn, inﬂuences the combustion process itself. In the case of an instability, this feedback may lead to very high amplitudes. In the worst case, these high amplitudes can damage or even de stroy the combustion system. Among other arrangements to weaken this feedback, ac oustic resonators are im- plemented in the walls of the combustion chamber [3, Chp. 8]. Exemplarily, an L-shape quarter-wave resonator mounted in the Vulcain 2, the main st age engine of the Ariane 5 rocket, is shown in Fig. 1.01 a. Prominent examples of resonators employed for the reduction of sound emissions are found in aero-engines [4, Chp. 19]. Several sound sources ar e present in such an engine, where fan noise is dominant in modern devices. Regularities f or sound emissions are continuously intensiﬁed to protect humans and animals from the harmful eﬀects of noise [4, Chp. 19]. Acoustic liners, which can be considered as an array of Helmholtz resonators, are commonly placed in the inlet and the exhaust duct to meet thes e regulations. Figures 1.01 b presents the placement of such liners in an engine. To determine the sound emissions or the thermoacoustic stability of a system equipped with resonators, a model for their dynamics is needed. Such a model is often provided in terms of the impedance. The impedance relates, by deﬁnition, the local ﬂuctuating acous- tic pressure to the local acoustic velocity in a linear fashi on. However, at high acoustic amplitudes, resonators do not behave in a linear manner due t o ﬂow separation at their edges. When the analysis is performed in the frequency or the L aplace domain, the linear- ity of the models considered is required. Hence, often local- linear models are constructed, where correction parameters are incorporated into the impe dance model emulating the nonlinear inﬂuence. A local-linear model is valid for a spec iﬁc amplitude range, for which the correction parameters are set. Accordingly, such a model cannot be used in the time domain when amplitudes change dynamically. However, a model accounting for dynamical changes is needed for a rigorous nonlinear analysis of syste ms in the time domain. This dissertation addresses the nonlinear damping eﬀects p resent in acoustic resonators. In particular, it focuses on high-ﬁdelity computational ﬂu id dynamics (CFD) simulations of the resonator dynamics including nonlinear phenomena, o n deepening the knowledge of the nonlinear mechanisms, and on their data-based reduced- order modeling.

Thus, a validated simulation setup can be a powerful tool to study aspects of th e nonlinear interactions. In the present thesis, the impact of the edge shape on the damp ing characteristics and the scattering to higher harmonics is investigated in detai l using this tool. The ﬁndings are consolidated by analytic considerations aligned with ﬂ ow visualizations. The poten- tial of CFD simulations is also employed to generated models o f the resonator dynamics. Existing models are mainly based on ﬁrst principles in combi nation with some correction terms. These correction terms are adjudicated by correlati on analysis of experimental data. When the set of correlation parameters is determined co rrectly, the harmonic be- havior of the resonator can be described well for a ﬁxed ampli tude of excitation. In this thesis, a data-based modeling approach is pursued. Based on the input/output data of a simulation, a reduced-order model (ROM) is estimated using system identiﬁcation (SI) techniques. ROMs are generated in both the linear and the non linear regime. By this procedure, an eﬃcient and robust approach is presented to ge nerate accurate models for various resonator geometries and conditions. The results were presented at conferences and in journals. Major publications are repro- duced in the Appendix A. The present paper-based dissertation guides through these publications by summarizing the most important results, em bedding them in the liter- ature context, and, most importantly, showing the intercon nections between them. The thesis is structured as follows: Section 2 lays the theoreti cal and terminological foundation. Diﬀerent types of resonators (Sec. 2.01) as well as the ﬂuid dy namic and acoustic governing 1 Private photography taken with permission at the museum of the DLR (Deut sches Zentrum f¨ ur Luft- und Raumfahrt), Lampoldshausen (Germany). equations (Sec. 2.02) are introduced. Modeling in terms of th e reﬂection coeﬃcient and the impedance (Secs. 2.03 and 2.04) as well as a 1-D quasi-steady mo deling approach (Sec. 2.05) are presented. In Sec. 3, the impact of several parameters of quarter-wave resonators on the linear thermoacoustic stability of a generic rocket com bustion chamber is demon- strated by a network model. The computational setup is intro duced in Sec. 4. Section 5 addresses some aspects of the nonlinear behavior. The shape of the edges of resonators inﬂuences the separation behavior and, thus, the nonlinear damping characteristics as discussed in Sec. 5.01. The scattering to higher harmonics for diﬀerent resonator types is considered in Sec. 5.02. Section 6 reports on data-based redu ced-order modeling. After a general introduction on SI (Sec. 6.01), the linear SI approac h and results for some test cases are presented in Sec. 6.02. This approach is extended in to the nonlinear regime by a new gray-box model in Sec. 6.03. Finally, conclusions are giv en in Sec. 7. Here, also the author’s contribution to the attached papers is described c learly. Introduction 2 Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background This chapter introduces the essential terminology and analytical concepts of the thesis. First, the diﬀerent types of resonators are introduced in Sec. 2.01. Here, the principle of the damping mechanism is also brieﬂy described in prose. Sectio n 2.02 presents the governing equations from ﬂuid dynamics and sketches the derivations o f the acoustic Helmholtz and wave equation. In Sec. 2.03, it is shown that the linear impact of a resonator located at the boundary of a domain can be modeled as an impedance or a reﬂ ection coeﬃcient. Describing functions generalize these expressions for the nonlinear regime as presented in Sec. 2.04. Finally, a quasi-steady 1-D modeling approach comm only used in the literature is given in Sec. 2.05. Such a relatively simple approach can mode l the dynamics surprisingly well and helps to develop a clear picture of them. 2.01 Working Principle and Types of Resonators Hard walls fully reﬂect an incident wave without any loss. Whereas, at an acoustic res- onator, the incident wave is only partially reﬂected due to i mposed losses there. A res- onator exploits the resonance of a cavity being connected vi a one or several openings to the chamber. This resonance leads to high particle velociti es at the opening of the cav- ity, which causes losses there. In general, two main types of resonators are distinguished: locally and non-locally reacting resonators. In the locall y reacting case, its behavior is independent of the angle of the incident acoustic wave. This is achieved when either only one opening per cavity is present or when the openings connec ted via the backing vol- ume are arranged closely to each other (in comparison to the w avelength). Otherwise, the resonator is referred to as non-locally reacting and its beh avior cannot be modeled by considering only a local section of the device’s surface, as sketched in Fig. 2.01 a. In most technical applications, resonators can be considered as lo cally reacting. Hence, this thesis is restricted to that kind of resonators. Three prototypes o f locally reacting resonators can be identiﬁed: the Helmholtz, the half-wave, and the quart er-wave resonator. The Helmholtz resonator, displayed in Fig. 2.01 d, is named after Her mann von Helmholtz, who was the ﬁrst to analyze it theoretically. This resonator type has a closed cavity, which is connected to the chamber via an opening with a narrow cross -section, the so-called neck. The half-wave and the quarter-wave resonators consist of tu bes, see Figs. 2.01 b and 2.01 c. The opening of such a tube resonator linked to the chamber is r eferred to as its mouth. The half-wave resonator has also an opening at the backside o f the tube, while the end of the quarter-wave type is closed. The lengths of the tubes det ermine the eigenfrequencies of the half-wave and the quarter-wave resonators. The half a nd the quarter of eigenfre- Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background θ (a) Non-locally reacting resonator.

Since an open end is often diﬃcult t o realize, the quarter-wave tube and Helmholtz resonator are mainly implemented in appli cations. Accordingly, only those two types are considered in the present thesis. For locally reacting resonators, Rayleigh described their working principle by the anal- ogy to a mechanical mass-spring-damper system. The mass in t he neck or the mouth of the resonator corresponds to the mass in its mechanical coun terpart. The imposed losses and the compressibility of the backing volume correlate wit h the losses of the mechanical damper and the stiﬀness of the spring, respectively. The ext ernal pressure driving the sys- tem corresponds to a force acting on the mechanical system. A mathematical description of this system is given in Sec. 2.05. The losses mentioned above are caused by the ﬂuid motion at the opening of the resonator. There are two main loss mechanisms: the thermo-viscous loss es due to friction at the walls and losses due to ﬂow separation. The former scale linearly w ith the particle velocity. This means that, for instance, the losses double when the vel ocity doubles. However, this relation is not valid for the losses caused by the ﬂow sep aration. When the particle velocity at the edges of the resonator is beyond a certain lev el, the ﬂuid particle cannot follow the resonator contour, the ﬂow separates and a jet for ms. The kinetic energy of that jet does not recuperate into the acoustic energy, but is transformed into vortices 2.02 Governing Equations (a) Linear regime. (b) Nonlinear regime. Figure 2.02: Snapshots of streamlines in the vicinity of a Helmholtz reson ator neck gen- erated with the CFD environment introduced in Chp. 4. instead, which are ﬁnally dissipated via the turbulent casc ade process. The energy which the jet carries—and thus also the acoustic loss—depends on t he particle velocity in a nonlinear manner. Moreover, the level of forcing inﬂuences the induced ﬂow at the opening of the resonator noticeably. The change of the ﬂow character istics impacts not only the acoustic losses as described above, but also the ﬂuid mass ta king part in the resonant ﬂow motion. This corresponds to a variation of mass in the mass-s pring-damper model and, thus, changes the eigenfrequency of the resonator. It is com mon to distinguish between the linear and the nonlinear regime. In the linear regime, where the acoustic forcing is suﬃciently low, only the linear eﬀects are present. The reso nator is said to be operated in the nonlinear regime when the forcing is high enough to trigg er nonlinear eﬀects. Typical streamlines for both regimes are illustrated for an Helmholt z resonator in Fig. 2.02. The ﬂow separation at the edges can clearly be seen in the nonline ar regime presented in Fig. 2.02 b. In this thesis, these nonlinear eﬀects are studied in detail (see Sec. 5) and a data-based reduced-order model for their description is de veloped (see Sec. 6). 2.02 Governing Equations This thesis investigates the acoustic damping of resonators, i. e. the losses of sound propa- gating in a ﬂuid when it interacts with those devices. All rele vant eﬀects are fully included in the Navier-Stokes equations for Newtonian, compressible ﬂuids without external forces (see for instance the manuscript by Davidson ). This set o f equations consists of the continuity, the momentum, and the energy equation. The relation between the density ρ and the velocity of the ﬂuid ui in space xi and time t can be written in Einstein notation for the mass and momentum equation as: dρ dt + ρ∂ui ∂xi = 0, and (2.01) ρdui dt = − ∂p ∂xi + ∂ ∂xj ( 2µ Sij − 2 3µ∂uk ∂xk δij ). (2.02) Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background Above, the operator d · /dt denotes the material derivative d · /dt = ∂ · /∂t + ui ∂ · /∂xi. The pressure, the viscosity, and the strain rate tensor are r eferred to as p, µ, and Sij, respectively. The rate tensor is deﬁned as Sij = 1 /2 ( ∂ui/∂xj + ∂uj/∂xi). The transport equation for the internal energy e reads as: ρde dt = −p∂ui ∂xi + 2µ Sij Sij − 2 3µ Skk Sii + ∂ ∂xi ( k T ∂T ∂xi ). (2.03) Above, the variables T and k T stand for the temperature and the thermal conductivity, respectively. In addition to the partial diﬀerential equat ions (PDEs) above, two equations of state are required for a complete problem description. He re, the ideal gas law can be applied for all cases considered: p = ρRs T, (2.04) where Rs is the speciﬁc gas constant. For an ideal gas, the speciﬁc int ernal energy e and the temperature T are linked by the relation: e = ∫ cv d T = ∫ cp d T − p ρ, (2.05) where cv and cp denote the speciﬁc heat capacities at constant speciﬁc volu me and at constant pressure, respectively. The set of equations above describes the whole physics involved. However, it is often meaningful to consider some simpliﬁcation of them. Disrega rding viscosity, the momentum equation (2.02) reduces to the Euler equation ρdui dt + ∂p ∂xi = 0. (2.06) If additionally the ﬂow is assumed to be incompressible and i rrotational, i. e. ωi ≡ ǫijk ∂uk/∂xj = 0 1, it further reduces to the incompressible Bernoulli equation ∂φ ∂t + 1 2 uiui + p ρ = const. (2.07) This equation is valid along a streamline and the variable φ stands for the potential of the irrotational ﬂow ∂φ/∂xi = ui. It is often starting point for the analysis of so-called acoustically compact elements, see Sec. 2.05. In acoustics, isentropic disturbances of ﬂow variables are considered. Hence, any varying quantity q is decomposed into its mean q 0 and its ﬂuctuating parts q′, i. e. q = q 0 + q′. If the ﬂuctuating parts are small in comparison to a suitable re ference value, it is valid with only minor loss of generality to neglect higher-order produ cts of ﬂuctuating quantities. The continuity (2.01) and the Euler equation (2.06) for the ﬂuc tuating quantities read as d 0ρ′ dt + ρ0 ∂u′ i ∂xi = 0 and (2.08) ρ0 d 0 u′ i dt + ∂p′ ∂xi = 0, (2.09) 1ǫijk denotes the permutation tensor deﬁned as ǫijk =      1 if ( i, j, k) ∈ { (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)} −1 if ( i, j, k) ∈ { (3, 2, 1), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3)} 0 else 2.02 Governing Equations where d 0 · /dt stands for the material derivative with respect to the mean ﬂ ow u 0, i. For an isentropic compression, the ﬂuctuating pressure p′ and density ρ′ are related in ﬁrst order approximation as p′ = c 2 0ρ′, (2.010) where the constant c 0 is deﬁned as c 2 0= ( ∂p/∂ρ)s with the index s indicating the isentropic relation. The variable c 0 is named speed of sound, since acoustic perturbations propagate in space with that speed, as it can be seen below in Eq. (2.012). For an ideal gas, the speed of sound is given by c 0 = √ γRs T, where γ denotes the adiabatic index γ = cp/cv. By combination of Eqs. (2.08), (2.09) and (2.010), the so-called wave equation can be formulated: d 2 0 p′ dt 2 − c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂xi∂xi = 0. (2.011) When the acoustic pressure p′ is know, the particle velocity u′ i can be deduced from it by applying Eqs. (2.08) and (2.010). In many applications, the sound propagates in a 1-D manner. This is, e. g. valid for plane waves in a duct with constant cross section area. Hence, a 1-D c onﬁguration is considered in the following paragraph. The wave equation (2.011) can be factorized as ( d 0 dt + c 0 ∂ ∂x )( d 0 dt − c 0 ∂ ∂x ) p′ = 0. (2.012) Each factor represents an operator known from the convectio n equation with the con- vective speeds ±(c 0 ∓ u 0). In this form, it can be seen that the solution of the 1-D wave equation consists of two perturbations traveling upstream and downstream with the speed c 0 relative to the mean ﬂuid motion. These two characteristic w aves, also known as Rie- mann invariants, are deﬁned as f = 1 ( p′ ρ0 c 0 + u′ ) and g = 1 ( p′ ρ0 c 0 − u′ ). (2.013) Accordingly, the acoustic velocity and pressure is given in t erms of f and g as u′ = f − g and p′ ρ0 c 0 = f + g, (2.014) respectively. In linear acoustics, equations are often transformed into frequency domain by the Fourier transform F. Quantities in the frequency domain are indicated by ˆ· and the angular frequency is denoted as ω in the following. The pressure in frequency domain ˆ p is given by ˆp(ω) = F{p}(ω) = ∫ ∞ −∞ p(t) e−iωtdt. (2.015) Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background When the pressure is determined in the frequency domain, the i nverse Fourier transform F−1 yields the corresponding value in the time domain p(t) = F−1{ˆp}(t) = 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ ˆp eiωtdω. (2.016) A quantity gained by the inverse Fourier transform is comple x-valued. Without loss of generality, the real part of this quantities can be consider ed as the physical quantity. The 3-D wave equation (2.011) without mean ﬂow is transformed to ∂2 ˆp ∂xi∂xi + k 2 ˆp = 0 (2.017) and is named Helmholtz equation. The parameter k is called wavenumber and is deﬁned as k ≡ ω/c 0. In a 1-D setup, the propagation of a f-wave in a duct with length l can be written in terms of the wavenumber as: fout = exp( −i lk)fin, where fin/out denote the f-wave entering and leaving the duct, respectively. 2.03 Impedance and Reﬂection Coeﬃcient Solving the Helmholtz equation (2.017) on a given domain requires setting boundary condi- tions (BCs) on the entire boundary. For an ideal opening to th e environment, no pressure ﬂuctuations are assumed, i. e. a Dirichlet BC ˆ p = 0 is set on such a boundary. At a hard wall, no wall-normal velocity ﬂuctuations can take place, w hich means that the gradi- ent of the pressure vanishes in wall-normal direction ni. This means the Neumann BC (∂ ˆp/∂xi) ni = 0 is set. In addition to these ideal cases, situations occur where the pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations are coupled in a certain manner. Th is is modeled as a Robin BC with the so-called (surface) impedance Z. This quantity is deﬁned in the frequency domain as the ratio of the pressure ﬂuctuations ˆ p to the wall-normal velocity ﬂuctuation ˆui ni: Z(ω) = ˆp(ω) ˆui(ω) ni. (2.018) Hence, the impedance describes the frequency response funct ion for the pressure when the boundary is excited by a velocity ﬂuctuation. Impedance values should be regarded as an “eﬀective, averaged boundary condition the incident s ound experiences rather than as a detailed quantity associated with a point measurement”. The real and imag- inary part of the complex valued impedance are denoted as the resistance and the re- actance, respectively. It can be shown that an acoustically passive boundary exhibits a non-negative resistance Re( Z) ≥ 0 and that the boundary absorbs sound for Re( Z) > 0, see Rienstra. The two special cases of an ideal opening a nd a hard wall correspond to impedances Zopen = 0 and |Zwall| = ∞, receptively. The impedance perceived by an acoustic wave traveling within a ﬂuid is called speciﬁc impedance and is given by ρ0 c 0. To allow for a more intuitive interpretation, the impedance is often normalized with respect to that speciﬁc value. The normalized impedance z = Z/(ρ0 c 0) is denoted by lower case z in the following. By a 1-D acoustic analysis, the impeda nce of a loss-free quarter-wave 2.03 Impedance and Reﬂection Coeﬃcient tube with eﬀective length le can be calculated. An f-wave is entering the tube, propagates the distance le along the tube, is reﬂected at the hard wall end (with reﬂecti on coeﬃcient R = 1, see below Eq. (2.021)), and ﬁnally travels as g-wave along the tube in opposite direction. This yields the normalized impedance z(ω) = 1 ρ0 c 0 ˆp ˆu = f + g f − g = 1 + exp( −i 2 lek) 1 − exp(−i 2 lek) = −i cot ( ω le c 0 ), (2.019) where k ≡ ω/c 0 denotes the wavenumber, see Eq. (2.017). The relation between the acoustic velocity and the pressure on a boundary Z(ω)ˆu(ω) = ˆp(ω) can also be described in the time domain. The multiplicatio n in the frequency domain results in a convolution (marked by the symbol ∗) of u(t) with the so-called impulse response of the impedance Zt(t): p(t) = ( F−1{Z} ∗ u ) (t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ Zt(τ) u(t − τ) dτ. (2.020) The impulse response Zt is given by the inverse Fourier transformed impedance Zt(t) = F−1{Z}(t) = 1 /(2π) ∫∞ −∞ Z(ω) exp(iωt) dω. A physical system formulated in a ‘cause and eﬀect manner’ can be assumed to be causal, which means that it s response cannot depend on future inputs. In formula, this means that Zt(t) = 0 for all t < 0. Another way to acoustically characterize a boundary is the ra tio of the reﬂected acoustics (g) to the normally incident ( f), see Fig. 2.01 ( θ = 0). This is done by the reﬂection coeﬃcient, which is deﬁned as R(ω) = ˆg(ω) ˆf(ω). (2.021) Its connection to the impedance is given by R = z − 1 z + 1 = Z − ρ0 c 0 Z + ρ0 c 0, or z = Z ρ0 c 0 = 1 + R 1 − R. (2.022) In the formula above, it can be observed that there are no reﬂe ctions for a normalized impedance of unity, z = 1. A system with a normalized resistance below and above uni ty is referred to as normally damped and over-damped, respectively. When the plane wave is incident upon boundary with an angle θ (see Fig. 2.01 a), the reﬂection is given by Rθ = z cos(θ) − 1 z cos(θ) + 1. (2.023) The maximal absorption is achieved for z = 1 / cos(θ) in that case. Frequency response functions such as R and Z describe the system behavior in the Fourier domain and, thus, are valid if the system dynamics are neithe r decaying nor growing. In many aeroacoustic systems, this assumption applies. For in stance, the sound propagation in the inlet duct of an aero-engine can be studied under this a ssumption, since the sound pressure does not vary on short time scales. However, this ass umption is violated when the (linear) thermoacoustic stabilization of a system is st udied. Here, transfer functions Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background in the Laplace domain have to be considered. Exemplarily sho wn for the pressure, the Laplace transformation L is deﬁned as: P (s) = L{p}(s) = ∫ ∞ p(t)e−st dt. (2.024) Functions in the Laplace domain are denoted by an capital let ter, e. g. P (s) for the pressure. The complex-valued Laplace variable s = σs + i ω describes both the angular frequency ω and the growth rate σs of a signal. All frequency response functions deﬁned in the Fourier domain can also be deﬁned analogously in the Lapl ace domain. For instance, the impedance reads here as: Zs(s) = P (s) U(s). (2.025) The frequency response functions in the Fourier domain deﬁn e the behavior only on the imaginary axis of the complex-valued Laplace domain. The La place domain representation contains additional information for the behavior of the sys tem responding to an decaying or increasing input signal u′(t) = ˆu exp[(σs + iω)t]. The transfer behavior of any linear, time-invariant (LTI) s ystem can fully be modeled by a transfer function in the Laplace domain. In this context, linear means that the input and the output signal (which are functions in time) can be related to each other by a linear function. Time-invariant implies that the chara cteristics of the system do not change in time. If the frequency response is known in the Four ier domain, say Z(ω), it generally cannot be extruded into the Laplace domain as Zs(s) = Zs(σs + i ω) ̸= Z(ω) for σs ̸= 0, see Schmid et al. A frequency response described by a holomorphic 2 or meromorphic 3 function can be extended to a transfer function in the Laplac e domain by analytic continuation, which is by construction valid for t he underlying LTI system. In experiments, the impedance cannot be obtained directly s ince the velocity in the neck is diﬃcult to measure. When there is no mean ﬂow present, the tw o- or multi-microphone method oﬀers a good possibility to determine the impedance, see for instance Temiz et al. Here, a sample, such as a resonator, is located at the end of a tube, the so- called impedance tube, which is equipped with an array of microphones. A loudspeak er placed at the other end excites this conﬁguration harmonica lly. From the pressure data of the microphones, the characteristic f- and g-waves (see Eq. (2.013)) can be reconstructed. Their ratio gives the reﬂection coeﬃcient R, cf. Eq. (2.021), from which the impedance can be deduced, see Eq. (2.022). However, for acoustic resonat ors, the transformation from the reﬂection coeﬃcient R to the resistance Re( z) is ill-conditioned for frequencies clearly distinct from the eigenfrequency, see F¨ orner and Polifke [1 5, Sec. 3.03]. This means that even a small deviation in the reﬂection coeﬃcient can lead to a huge deviation in the resistance. In presence ofgrazing ﬂow —a mean ﬂow normal to the resonator opening, this impedance tube approach is diﬃcult to realize. The in-situ method deve loped by Dean can be applied instead under such conditions. Here, at least one mic rophone is mounted on the 2 complex diﬀerentiable 3 holomorphic except for a set of isolated points 2.04 Impedance and Reﬂection Coeﬃcient Describing Function s front plate and one at the bottom of the cavity. Assuming 1-D ac oustic propagation in the cavity, the impedance can be deduced from these measurem ents. In a supervised Semester thesis by the present author, Bambauer implem ented both methods in the CFD setup presented in Sec. 4.01 and showed a reasonable agreem ent of impedance values determined by these approaches. However, a slight discrepan cy increasing with the grazing velocity was visible. Due to diﬃculties placing the microph one close to the sample, so- called impedance education techniques are widespread. Here, the microphones are located far away from the sample and the impedance is calculated by an inverse problem by means of CAA simulations, see for instance Zhou. 2.04 Impedance and Reﬂection Coeﬃcient Describing Functions As mentioned above, a resonator behaves in a linear manner onl y for suﬃciently small particle velocities close to the edges of the opening. For la rger velocities, the ﬂow separates, leading to nonlinear eﬀects. Sivian as well as Ing ˚ ard a nd Labate were among the ﬁrst discovering and modeling this nonlinear behavior. In Sec. 2.05, the impact of the separation eﬀects on the damping characteristics is dis cussed in more detail. In the nonlinear regime, the system behavior cannot be modeled by a transfer function, which is by deﬁnition only valid for an LTI system. Measurements an d models are nevertheless often presented in a similar fashion as so-called describing functions. Here, the harmonic response of the system to harmonic forcing is given in depend ence on the frequency and the sound pressure level (SPL), see for instance Hersh et al. The SPL serves as an indicator for the strength of the acoustic signal. It is deﬁn ed via the root mean square (RMS) of the acoustic pressure prms and the reference pressure pref = 20 µPa as SPL = 20 log 10 ( prms pref ) d B. (2.026) However, the describing function does not describe the entir e behavior of a nonlinear system. Overall, the nonlinear behavior of an acoustic resonator manifests itself in several aspects: The most prominent nonlinear eﬀect is that the harmonic beha vior changes with the exci- tation amplitude. This eﬀect is considered by the describing function approach. Hence, for many technical applications, the impedance describing fun ction captures major parts of the dynamics if acoustic amplitudes remain constant. Howeve r, there is also scattering to higher harmonics, which cannot be modeled by the impedance describing func- tion. This scattering is investigated both analytically an d numerically by F¨ orneret al for Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators and is brieﬂy summ arized in Sec. 5.02. In pres- ence of broadband acoustic excitation, the SPL is not a suita ble quantity to correlate with nonlinear eﬀects. Instead, the RMS of the particle velocity at the resonator opening seems to be appropriate, see Bod´ en. Moreover, the acoustic b ehavior at a certain frequency can be inﬂuenced noticeably by multi-tonal excitation, whi ch means that in the excitation signal not only a single frequency is present, but also multi ples of that frequencies, see Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background l 0 lcav d 0 dcav (a) Helmholtz resonator. 1 22 dcavd 0 l 0 lcav (b) Neck and backing cavity. Figure 2.03: Segregation of the Helmholtz resonator into its components. Bod´ en and Serrano et al. For this special type of excitation, the resistance for a speciﬁc frequency can even take negative values. 2.05 1-D Modeling Approaches Ingard and Ising suggested studying a Helmholtz resonator segregated in its neck and its backing cavity, as depicted in Fig. 2.03. For typical ge ometries, the neck itself is acoustically compact. This means that the neck is very small in comparison to the ac oustic wavelength λ = 2 πc 0/ω, or in other words the Helmholtz number He = l 0/λ ≪ 1. Here, l 0 denotes the length of the neck. In the following, its diamete r is referred to as d 0 and the cylindrical cavity has the length lcav and the diameter dcav, as sketched in Fig. 2.03. With a compact neck, eﬀects of compressibility do not have to b e taken into account for the neck but only for the cavity (cf. Eq. (2.028) below). The co mpact neck is characterized in the frequency domain by the transfer impedance Zo = ∆ˆp ˆu, (2.027) where ∆ˆp = ˆp 1 − ˆp 2 stands for the ﬂuctuating pressure drop from position 1 to 2, see Fig. 2.03 b. The velocity ˆu refers to the cross-sectional surface averaged velocity in the duct. It is equal on both sides of the neck due to the mass conservati on and the assumption of incompressibility. There are other authors using the cro ss-sectional surface averaged velocity in the neck u′ o instead. These two velocities are related via the porosity o f the resonator plate σ ≡ d 2 0/d 2 cav, such that u′ = σu′ o. The surface impedance of the cylindrical cavity at position 2 is given by Zcav = ˆp 2 ˆu 2 = −i ρ0 c 2 lcav ω. (2.028) This expression can be derived by assuming an isentropic uni form compression/expansion of the backing volume. In ﬁrst order approximation (of the La urent series), this agrees with the admittance of a quarter-wave tube given in Eq. (2.019 ), cf. Tournadre et al. Summing up both contributions yields the overall impedance Z of the resonator at the reference plane 1 (cf. Fig. 2.03 a) Z = Zo + Zcav. (2.029) 2.05 1-D Modeling Approaches Thus, the knowledge of the transfer impedance of the neck all ows for the full characteri- zation of the Helmholtz resonator. The ﬂow through the neck can be treated as incompressible dueto its acoustic compact- ness. For this purpose, the incompressible Bernoulli equat ion (2.07) is applied. By doing so, it is implicitly assumed that the ﬂow is inviscid and does not separate. The equation is expressed in terms of ﬂuctuating quantities in 1-D, where x denotes the axial spatial coordinate in the following. Evaluation on a streamline on t wo reference points on both sides of the neck gives: (φ′ 2− φ′ 1) + 1 ( u′ 2 − u′ ) + 1 ρ0 (p′ 2− p′ 1) = 0. (2.030) The ﬁrst term can be rewritten by introducing an eﬀective len gth le φ′ 2− φ′ 1 = ∫ 2 u′(x) dx = ∫ 2 Ao A(x)u′ odx = u′ ole = u′ σ le. (2.031) Here, Ao and u′ o denote the cross section area and the velocity in the neck, re spectively. The x-dependent cross section area formed by the ﬂow path is A(x). Note that the eﬀective length equals the geometrical length of the neck lo with an additional end correction, see, e. g. Ingard. Due to the conservation of mass, u 1 = u 2 and, therefore, the second term in Eq. (2.030) vanishes. Thus, the pressure drop ∆ p′ = p′ 1− p′ 2 over the neck without losses can be expressed as: ∆ p′ ≈ ρ0 σ le ∂u′ ∂t. (2.032) The thermo-viscous losses along the neck walls, which are no t considered in the above equation, can be included by an appropriate real-valued con stant Rl (see, e. g. Bod´ en and Zhou ). When the acoustical particle displacement in the neck reaches the same order of magnitude as the neck diameter d 0 or is larger, i. e. when the Strouhal number Sr = ω d 0 σ/|ˆu| is small, the ﬂow cannot follow the edge contour and separate s. Thus, the ﬂow contracts, taking less area to jet through the neck as ske tched in Fig. 2.03. The ratio of the ﬂow core area to the geometrical cross-sectional area is described by the vena contracta factor Cd, which is also often referred to as the discharge coeﬃcient. In the linear regime where Sr ≫ 1, it can be assumed Cd ≈ 1, whereas Cd < 1 holds in the nonlinear regime. Besides the eﬀects captured by the Strouhal number, also the edge shape has a strong impact on the separation process. The separation is m ore pronounced, the sharper the edge is, see also Sec. 5.01. Using the contraction f actor, the velocity in the neck can be expressed as u′ o = 1 /(Cd σ) u′. When such a jet forms, it draws energy oﬀ the acoustics, which is dissipated in the vortex structures gen erated due to the separation. If it is assumed that the kinetic energy of the ﬂow in the neck 1 /2 ρ0 (1/(Cd σ) ˜u′)2 is fully dissipated and does not recuperate downstream of the neck (s ee for instance Ingard ), it follows ∆ p′ ≈ ρ0 σ le ∂u′ ∂t   inertia + Rl u′  viscosity + 1 2ρ0 u′|u′| (Cd σ)2    ﬂow separation. (2.033) The inﬂuence of the backing volume can be inserted into Eq. (2.33). The pressure inside the cavity at location 2 can be expressed as ∂p′ 2/∂t = ρ0 c 2 0 u′/lcav (cf. Eq. (2.028)).

Equa- tion (2.034) can be rewritten using the constants m and K for the description of respectively the inertia eﬀect of the mass in the opening and the compressi bility of the backing volume: σ p′ ≈ m ∂2 x′ ∂t 2 + Rtotal ∂x′ ∂t + K x′. (2.036) The ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) above has the same s tructure as an ODE mod- eling a mechanical mass-spring-damper system as sketched i n Fig. 2.05. This provides the mathematical justiﬁcation for the mechanical analogy alre ady given in Sec. 2.01. From the study of such single degree of freedom oscillators (SDOFs), i t is known that its angular eigenfrequency equals ωeig = √ K m = c 0 √ σ le lcav. (2.037) For moderate damping, the free system oscillates at its angu lar eigenfrequency ωeig. Equation (2.036) can be transform in the frequency and the Lap lace domain, i. e. ˆp(ω) = Z(ω)ˆu(ω) and P (s) = Zs(s)U(s), respectively. The resulting expressions for the impedance are given by: Z(ω) = Rtotal + i ( m ω − K ω ) and (2.038) Zs(s) = Rtotal + s m + 1 s K.

Figure 2.06: Impedance and reactance determined by the generic SDOF mode l in Eq. (2.038) for a normally damped, an optimally damped, and over- damped system. In the following, the dynamics of the SDOF system (2.036) are d iscussed in terms of the impedance and the reﬂection coeﬃcient. For that purpose, ge neric systems with the mass m/(ρ0 c 0) = 1 s and the compressibility constant K/(ρ0 c 0) = 1 s −1 are considered. The normalized impedances z and the corresponding reﬂection coeﬃcients R, determined by Eq. (2.022), are plotted in Fig. 2.06 for three cases. For these c ases, diﬀerent resistance values Rtotal/(ρ0 c 0) = Re( z) ∈ [0.05, 1, 4] are taken into account covering normally damped ( for Re( z) = 0.5), optimally damped ( for Re( z) = 0.5), and over-damped conditions ( for Re( z) = 4). For all cases, the angular eigenfrequency of the gener ic systems equal unity, where the reactance curves change their signs, see Fig. 2.06 b. In Fig. 2.06 c, it can clearly be seen that the resonator absorbs best at its eigenf requency ωeig = 1, meaning that the gain of the reﬂection coeﬃcient |R|. When the resistance Re( z) increases in the normally damped regime, the absorption increases. As explai ned above in Sec. 2.03, the resonator dampens optimally for Re( z) = 1 and absorbs all incident acoustic energy at its eigenfrequency, see the -curve in Fig. 2.06 c. In the over-damped regime with Re( z) > Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background 1, increasing the resistance decreases the maximal absorpt ion, while the bandwidth of absorption is widened simultaneously, see the -curve in Fig. 2.06 c. Moreover, the phase curves of the reﬂection coeﬃcients ̸ R behave diﬀerently depending on damping regimes, see Fig. 2.06 d. At the eigenfrequency, the f- and g-waves are respectively in phase for the normally damped ( ̸ R (mod 2 π) = 0) and in antiphase for the over-damped regime ( ̸ R (mod 2 π) = π). Far away from the eigenfrequency, R is always in phase. Overall, the nonlinear eﬀects for the damping behavior can b e brieﬂy be summarized like this: High acoustic amplitudes trigger ﬂow separation a t the edges. This leads to additional acoustic losses increasing the resistance. By v ariation of the resistance, the res- onator operates either in the normally damped or the over-da mped regime, resulting in the implications explained in the previous paragraph. In ad dition to the eﬀects on the re- sistance, ﬂow separation reduces the mass taking part in the oscillation. This corresponds to a reduction of the eﬀective length and shifts the eigenfre quency to higher frequencies. Semi-analytical approaches, similar to the one presented a bove, are followed by several authors to derive expressions for the impedance of a resonat or or an oriﬁce. Refer for instance to Rice, to Cummings and Eversman, to Elna dy and Bod´ en, as well as to Hersh et al. A similar idea can also be employed to model the impedance of a quarter-wave resonator. Its impedance can be written as (cf. C´ ardenas Miranda ) ZQW(ω) = RQW l + RQW nl − iρ0 c 0 cot ( ω l QW e c 0 ). (2.040) Also for this resonator type, the resistance consists of a lin ear RQW l and a nonlinear component RQW nl. The linear resistance originates from the friction at the w all, which is largest close to the mouth of the resonator, since here the pa rticle velocities are highest. As in the case of the Helmholtz resonator, the additional losse s of the ﬂow separation for high velocities are collected in the term RQW nl. Usually, the transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime occurs for higher SPLs in comparison to a Helmholtz resonator with an eigenfrequency in the same order of magnitude, see [33, 41 ]. The eﬀective length l QW e corresponds to the length of the quarter-wave tube elongate d by a length correction. However, this length correction is smaller for the quarter-w ave resonator in comparison to the Helmholtz resonator, since it only has to account for the ﬂuid taking part in the oscillation in front of the one opening. The angular eigenfr equency is given by ωQW eig = c 0π 2 le. (2.041) The acoustic wavelength λ = 2 π c 0/ωQW eig corresponding to the eigenfrequency equals a quarter of the eﬀective length l QW e of the resonator, which explains the origin of its name. In the discussion above and also in the further course of the t hesis, eﬀects of mean ﬂow, temperature distribution, and hot gas penetration into the resonator opening are ignored. In many technically relevant application, there is a grazin g ﬂow over the resonator. For instance, this is studied experimentally by Jones et al and numerically by Zhang and Bodony. Summarized, the grazing ﬂow increases the resi stance, while the eﬀective length is decreased. Resonators in gas turbines are often purged, which means that cool 2.05 1-D Modeling Approaches (a) Outﬂow phase. (b) Inﬂow phase. Figure 2.07: CFD simulation (cf. Chp. 4) with grazing ﬂow (from left to righ t) in the nonlinear regime; vortices are visualized with the Q-crite rion. gas in injected into the backing cavity such that a mean ﬂow di rected outwards of the resonator is present. By doing so, they are guarded against t he hot gas in the combustion chamber and constant working conditions are guaranteed. Th is increases the acoustic losses signiﬁcantly, see, e. g. Eldredge and Dowling, Bellucci et al, or Scarpato et al. When the amplitude of the acoustic excitation rises and the purging ﬂow rate is too low, hot gas can penetrate the resonator opening. This ca n detune the resonator and should thus be avoided, see the studies by ´Cosi´ cet al and Rupp et al. The present thesis does not deal explicitly with these phenomena. Howeve r, the computational setup presented in Sec. 4.01 is capable of incorporating them. Figur e 2.07 presents exemplarily snapshots of a simulation in the nonlinear regime with grazi ng ﬂow. For details, refer to the theses, supervised by the present author, of Mayr an d of Bambauer. The latter also shows how a Helmholtz resonator with several open ings is correctly scaled to a single oriﬁce resonator. The data-based modeling approach es in Sec. 6 can also be applied under the mentioned operating conditions. Fluid Dynamic and Acoustic Background 3 Numerical Assessment of Thermoacoustic Stability Acoustic resonators are used to suppress thermoacoustic instabilities in combustion sys- tems. A ﬂuctuating combustion process leads to a ﬂuctuating t hermal expansion, which, in turn, can produce acoustic sound. In 1878, Rayleigh ex pressed this as follows: “For instability to occur, heat must be released at the moment of g reatest compression.” So, if the integral over the product of the ﬂuctuating heat relea se ˙Q′ and the ﬂuctuating pressure p′ over a period T is positive, i. e. ∫ T ˙Q′ p′ > 0, (3.01) the ﬂame acts as a sound source. The emitted sound is reﬂected at the boundaries of the chamber and aﬀects the combustion process again. This close d loop process can lead to a so-called thermoacoustic instability. Here, the pressure amplitude can grow to high values until the combustion chamber is either destroyed or nonline ar saturation processes and interdependencies come into play. Self-excited instabili ties can occur at the eigenfrequen- cies of the system. For an eigenfrequency, the assigned spat ial distribution of the acoustic quantities, especially of the pressure, is referred to as an eigenmode. Over the years, modeling of the mechanisms involved and thei r analytical and numerical evaluation became a powerful tool to study the interaction o f those mechanisms and supporting the design process of combustion systems. In Sec. 3.01, a very brief, exemplary and, hence, incomplete overview of such modeling approache s is given. The study of F¨ orner et al is summarized in Sec. 3.02. 3.01 Methodological Overview There exist several approaches to determine the thermoacoustic stability of a system. Among other things, they diﬀer in the extent to which models (i nstead of the full set of equations) are used to describe the involved phenomena. A way to reduce the com- plexity is to consider linearized problems. Linearized mod eling enables to determine the linear stability, i. e. predicting whether the amplitudes in the system grow or decay in the regime of small distortion from a chosen operating point. Due to this limitation, it cannot anticipate an amplitude level for linearly unstable o perating conditions. In return, linear systems can be evaluated in the frequency/Laplace do main. The increased mod- ern computational resources facilitate high-ﬁdelity CFD si mulations including nonlinear eﬀects even for large high-complex systems. For instance, Ur bano et al investigated Numerical Assessment of Thermoacoustic Stability the thermoacoustic behavior of a rocket combustion chamber with multiple injectors by means of large eddy simulations. However, the computational costs of such high-ﬁdelity simulations are not yet aﬀordable in industrial practice. A t the other end of the spectrum of modeling, there are analytical models for speciﬁc geomet ries. As an example, the modes of a rocket combustion chamber can be estimated by the eigenm odes in of a cylinder with an appropriate length correction for the nozzle. Due to the assumptions made, such pure analytic models are often inappropriate for realistic applications. Instead, the divide et impera strategy is of avail in many cases. Here, the overall syst em is segregated into sub-components. Models for those sub-components can, for i nstance, be derived analyti- cally, identiﬁed experimentally or numerically. Each sub- component is modeled separately and their models are connected to a network. For such network tools, see for instance Li and Morgans, often a 1-D acoustic behavior is assumed at the connecting planes. Via such a 1-D interfaces, also a 3-D computational domain can be coupled to the 1-D network simulation, see for instance Huber et al, Bellucci et al, Kaess et al, Schulze and Sattelmayer as well as Emmert et al. On such a 3-D computational domains, sets of equations of diﬀerent complexity can be solved. Jaens ch et al demonstrated that any (acoustic) linear subsystem behavior can be connec ted to a CFD simulation as a BC on a 1-D interface using a systematic state-space approa ch. As an alternative to the high-ﬁdelity CFD approach, linearized equations are oft en applied, as the Helmholtz, the linearized Euler, or the linearized Navier-Stokes equat ions, cf. Pankiewitz and Sat- telmayer, Nicoud et al as well as Gikadi. Besides the Helmholtz equation, such linearized equations require the mean ﬁeld informatio n, which has to be determined in an a priori CFD simulation. Accordingly, such hybrid approa ches are often referred to as CFD/CAA techniques. In combination with an appropriate ﬂame model, these tech- niques can predict the linear stability. For instance, Schu lze followed the CFD/CAA approach to study a rocket combustion chamber. In this study, the mode shape, which is determined in an initial CFD/CAA run, was used as an input to cha racterize the high- frequency response of the single ﬂame in a high-ﬁdelity CFD si mulation. Feeding back this ﬂame response into the CAA simulation enabled predictin g the linear stability. Overall, there exist various methods for the stability anal ysis of thermoacoustic systems. Resonators are employed in many relevant applications. For the stability analysis of such damped systems, all methods require an accurate model for th e damping performance of resonators, if they do not resolve this behavior explicit ly. Depending on the ﬁeld of application, such a model must either be linear—for a linear analysis in the frequency or the time domain—or nonlinear—for a rigorous nonlinear st udy in the time domain. In Sec. 6, it is discussed how reduced-order models can be pro vided on basis of CFD simulation data. Before that, a study with a low-order netwo rk model is presented in the following section, illustrating the stabilizing impact of resonators in a combustion system. 3.02 Network Model for a Rocket Combustion Cham- ber In this section, the study by F¨ orner et al (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 66ﬀ.) is brieﬂy presented. For a generic rocket combustion chamber, an extensive parametric study 3.02 Network Model for a Rocket Combustion Chamber Nozzle Injector Ring Flame Duct Duct Nyquist Figure 3.01: Acoustic network of a generic test cham- ber with resonator ring.

(Reproduced from.) is conducted regarding the impact of quarter-wave resonato rs on the linear thermoacoustic stability. The model used is based on the network model from C ´ ardenas Miranda and Polifke. It is deﬁned in the frequency domain and is capa ble of considering both plane and non-plane modes. The modeling approach and result s achieved are summarized in the following. The main idea of this modeling approach is the segregation ofthe entire system into sub- components. Figure 3.01 presents the segregated combustion c hamber, which is equipped with resonators. These resonators are arranged azimuthall y in a ring, as it is usually done in modern rocket motors, see for instance Oschwald and Farag o. This ring is modeled as a single element in the network. In a cylindrical duct segment, the 3-D solution of the convected wave equation can be written in cylindrical coordinates ( x, r, θ) as: p′(x, r, θ) c 0ρ0 = ∑ m,n [ Jm(α+ mnr)Fmne−ik+ mnx + Jm(α− mnr)Gmne−ik− mnx ] e−s teimθ = ∑ m,n (fmn + gmn), (3.02) where Jm denotes the ﬁrst kind Bessel function of order m. As in the 1-D case, there are also waves traveling downstream fmn and upstream gmn. Here, these waves have an additional azimuthal order m and a radial order n. Their phase velocity is determined by their wavenumbers, where k± mn and α± mn are the axial and radial wavenumbers. The superscripts + and - denote the corresponding wavenumbers f or the up- and downstream traveling waves, respectively. These numbers are linked by the dispersion relation ( α± mn ) 2 = ( − s c 0 − Ma k± mn ) 2 − ( k± mn ) 2, (3.03) Numerical Assessment of Thermoacoustic Stability where Ma stands for the Mach number of the axial uniform ﬂow in the cylindercal duct. Using the impedance BC at the cylinder wall, the wavenumbers c an be calculated for all orders m and n. In the case of a hard wall, this is done analytically. In the r esonator ring, an eﬀective homogeneous impedance is derived. For eac h resonator, an impedance model as in Eq. (2.040) is incorporated into this homogeneous expression. A numerical root-ﬁnding algorithm is applied to detect the wavenumbers for the soft wall conditions. At the interconnection with the resonator ring element, a mo de matching technique is employed to guarantee mass and momentum conservation over t he interface, see Gabard and Astley. This mode matching introduces also scatteri ng to higher order modes at the interfaces. The nozzle is modeled according to Bell and Zinn and, at the injector plate, full reﬂections are imposed. For the ﬂame considered as a thermoa coustic element of zero thickness, the well-known sensitive time lag model propose d by Crocco is applied: ˙Q′ ˙Q = nf ( 1 − e−sτ ) p′ u pu. (3.04) This n-τ model relates the relative pressure ﬂuctuation p′ u/pu on the cold upstream side to the relative ﬂuctuating heat release ˙Q′/ ˙Q with a time lag τ and an interaction index nf. Using the linearized Rankine-Hugoniot equations, the ﬂ uctuating heat release is translated into acoustic quantities. The eigenmodes and, a ccordingly, the linear stability of the entire system are estimated via the Nyquist criterion app lied in the Nyquist element, see Sattelmayer and Polifke. Here, the network is cut (as depict in Fig. 3.01) and the open loop transfer function is evaluated for signals with co nstant amplitude ( σs = 0). This has the advantage that the transfer behavior of each ele ment has to be known only for ω. The eigenfrequencies are estimated by the minimal distanc es to the critical point. By applying this network model for a generic test chamber, it is observed that the most unstable mode is the 1 T 1 L mode (ﬁrst longitudinal mode n = 1 with azimuthal order m = 1), which is indeed typical for rocket combustion chambers. By a parametric study, the optimal length and the optimal number of resonato rs are determined for that mode. An additional eigenmode is observed for a chamber equip ped with these well-tuned resonators. Both the original and the additional mode show f avorable stability properties. Resonators are often tuned—which means that their lengths a re varied—with respect to the eigenfrequencies of the undamped system. However, a noti ceable discrepancy between this a priori estimated length and the optimal length is obse rved. This highlights the neces- sity of analyzing the coupled system of resonators and combu stion chamber in the design process. Since publication, this main conclusion obtained with the low-order network has been conﬁrmed by the ﬁnite element simulations by Schulze et al. The stability map of the well-tuned and the totally undamped combustion chambe r is visualized in Fig. 3.02 with respect to the ﬂame parameters nf and τ. The area of the linearly stable operation conditions is signiﬁcantly increased by inserting the well -tuned resonator ring. Moreover, the sensitivity of the stability with respect to the nonline ar resistance of the resonators RQW nl is clearly pointed out in this study. This underlines the nee d for accurate models that describe the impact of high pressure oscillations. A me thod of generating data-based ROMs valid for such high pressure is presented in Sec. 6.03. 4 CFD Simulations of Acoustic Resonators The work presented employs CFD simulation as a major tool. Thecomputational setup is introduced in this chapter and the methodology is brieﬂy emb edded in the literature con- text. As acoustics is of compressible nature, a compressible solver, addressed in Sec. 4.01, is mostly applied. However, incompressible techniques can b e adopted for the aeroacous- tic characterization of acoustically compact elements. Th is is done for the Helmholtz resonator by a segregation approach, see Sec. 4.02. 4.01 Compressible CFD Simulations Tam and co-workers were among the ﬁrst to prove the potentialof CFD simulations to capture the resonator dynamics. Tam and Kurbatskii stu died via direct numerical simulations (DNSs) the vortex shedding at a slit resonator in 2-D. In dependency on frequency and SPL, they determined the transition from the l inear regime without vortex shedding to the nonlinear regime with vortex shedding. In th is juncture, they showed its acoustical damping eﬀect. These ﬁndings were validated exp erimentally by Tam et al. Tam et al performed DNSs on a 3-D computational domain and depicte d the diﬀerent structure of shed vortices in 3-D in comparison to 2-D. Howeve r, the vortex shedding remained the main source for acoustical dissipation for hig h SPLs also in the 3-D setup. Zhang and Bodony also followed the DNS approach in a series of p apers. They investigated the ﬂow physics in detail and demonstrated that the vortices form turbulent structures for high SPLs even for moderate Reynolds numbers based on the particle velocity. Furthermore, they analyzed the impact of laminar and turbul ent grazing ﬂow on the damping behavior. The eﬀect of purging ﬂow through an or iﬁce was studied by means of large eddy simulations (LESs) by Mendez and Eldredge as well as by Scarpato et al. Moreover, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations can be used to investigate the linear response of resonator, as it was done by Tournadre et al for the investigation of temperature eﬀects. An alternative approach to solving the Na vier-Stokes equations is the Lattice Boltzmann method, which is based on particle collis ion models and is promising low numerical cost, see for instance Ji and Zhao. Main parts of the work presented are also based on CFD simulations. Compressible CFD simulations are performed with Open FOAM for an ideal g as with the PIM- PLE algorithm, which is a combination of algorithms SIMPLE [ 81] and PISO. This pressure-based algorithm solves the compressible Navier-S tokes equations, see Sec. 2.02, us- ing second-order schemes in space and time. The time integra tion is executed implicitly by CFD Simulations of Acoustic Resonators f Input: no slipslip detection plane g Output: lref reference point for SPL NSCBC Figure 4.01: Computational domain for the Helmholtz resonator. a backward time stepping. In principle, this scheme allows f or acoustic Courant-Friedrichs- Lewy (CFL) numbers c 0∆ t/∆ x larger than unity, where ∆ t and ∆ x denote the time step and the length interval of the computational grid, respecti vely. However, computational setups with acoustic CFL numbers considerably smaller than u nity in the major parts of the grids are considered for the high-ﬁdelity simulations. Resolving the acoustics correctly in the simulation requires an accurate velocity-pressure- energy coupling. In Open FOAM, this is achieved by the convergence control with a suﬃcientl y low threshold for the pres- sure residuum, which is set maximally to 1 × 10−5. The time step is set to ∆ t = 1 × 10−6 s for cases with an eigenfrequency 2 πωeig < 1 k Hz. Both axisymmetric 2-D and 3-D structured meshes are conside red in the studies presented. The axisymmetric and 3-D meshes are generated by the Open FOAM tool block Mesh and the commercial software ANSYS ICEM CFD, respectively. The cell s izes close to the walls at the opening of the resonator must be set ﬁne enough to resolve the boundary layer for the frequency range of interest, which can be estim ated by the Stokes length δs = 2 π √ 2µ/(ωρ0). For all published results, mesh independence is achieved regarding the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcient. For the conﬁgurations considered without mean ﬂow, it is showed that sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence models in LES have only a minor impact on the acoustic properties, see the supervised Master’s thesis by Qin. Zhang and Bod ony demonstrated that ﬂow separation leads to turbulent structures in front of the resonator opening also for rather low Reynolds numbers. However, it is checked by compar ison to LES—applying, i. a. the k-equation eddy-viscosity model—that SGS modeling has only minor inﬂuence on the resulting impedances and vortex separation for the ca ses considered. This shows that the mesh resolution in the vicinity of the resonator ope ning is chosen ﬁne enough to resolve the separation mechanism correctly even without a SGS model. Hence, good results can be achieved without SGS model, see. Howev er, this might change for other circumstance, for instance, when the SPL is further in creased or when a mean ﬂow is present. The general computational domain for the Helmholtz resonator is sketched in Fig. 4.01. For the quarter-wave resonator, the computations are set up ana logously. Since the dissipa- tion takes place at the resonator walls, a no-slip condition is used here, indicated by solid lines in the ﬁgure. A slip boundary condition is applied at th e boundaries of the cylindri- cal domain in front of the resonator, presented with dashed l ines, to exclude dissipative 4.01 Compressible CFD Simulations eﬀects not related to the resonator itself. At the inlet, the Navier-Stokes characteristics boundary condition (NSCBC), cf. Poinsot and Lele, is utilized. This boundar y con- dition ensures a low acoustic reﬂection of the outgoing g-wave at the boundary of the computational domain in the frequency range of interest. Si multaneously, an input signal can be imposed for the incoming f-wave. In the studies presented, either harmonic or broadband signals covering various SPL ranges have been app lied. The broadband signals imposed are generated according to F¨ oller and Polifke. Such a signal is designed in a way that it excites the entire frequency spectrum of interes t, while steep changes in the input signal are avoided, which could otherwise cause numer ical diﬃculties. Moreover, this signal shows a low autocorrelation, which promises to impro ve the identiﬁcation results, see Chap. 6. Detection planes are placed in the computational domain at asuﬃcient distance from the resonator such that non-acoustic disturbances are abse nt there. Such non-acoustic disturbances are present in the vicinity of the resonator op ening due to shed vortices. The resulting acoustic quantities must be independent of the po sition of this plane. If there is a diﬀerence noticeable at two planes close to the inlet, the c omputational domain has to be elongated further. At the planes, time series of the area av eraged ﬂuctuating pressure p′ and velocity u′ are detected. From these quantities, time series of the f- and g-waves can be computed directly, see Eq. (2.013). These time series a re time-shifted with respect to each other to account for the time it takes to travel from th e detection plane to the resonator and back. These corrected time series can either b e used for SI in the case of a broadband excitation, or the reﬂection coeﬃcient can be det ermined at a single frequency in case of a harmonic excitation. In the second case, the time series are cropped to an integer multiple of the excitation period 2 π/ω to avoid leakage in the discrete Fourier transform and to dispose of any transient behavior. Now, the r eﬂection coeﬃcient can be evaluated R(ω) = ˆg(ω)/ ˆf(ω) and the impedance can be deduced from it, see Eq. (2.022). In the nonlinear regime, the damping characteristics depen d on the amplitude of exci- tation. This dependency is often described in terms of the SP L. In a 1-D duct as in computational setup, the pressure at a reference position i s given by the superposition of an f- and a g-wave, p′/(ρ0 c 0) = f + g (cf. Eq. (2.014)). Using the laws for the propaga- tion of the plane waves in the duct and the reﬂection with the c oeﬃcient R(ω, SPL), the amplitude Af of a harmonic input signal f(t) = Af sin(ωt) has to be imposed as (cf. ) Af = 10 SPL/20 √ 2 pref |1 + R(ω, SPL) exp(−i ω 2 lref/c 0)| ρ0 c 0 (4.01) to gain the desired SPL at a reference position in a distance lref form the resonator. If the reﬂection coeﬃcient R—which is, in general, the case—is unknown, an iterative procedure of simulations is required to set the amplitude co rrectly, since its value is needed in Eq. (4.01). In the cases where the overall SPL is of mi nor importance, only the SPL of the incident acoustic wave is considered. This is refe rred to as incident SPL. This is also done by other authors, for instance, Tam and Kurbatsk ii as well as Zhang and Bodony. Note that in general the incident SPL and the actu al total SPL diﬀer from each other. The solver settings are validated against measurements forseveral test cases. Exemplar- ily, this is presented in Fig. 4.02 for measurements from Hersh et al.

(Figure is reproduced from ). of this conﬁguration are given by l 0 = 0.159 cm, d 0 = 0.635 cm, lcav = 2.54 cm, and dcav = 5.08 cm. Accordingly, its open area ratio σ = d 2 0/d 2 cavyields 1.56 % and its eigenfre- quency can be estimated around 570 Hz by Eq. (2.037) for ambient conditions and using 8/(3π) d 0 as end correction. The experiment has been conducted fo r four SPLs namely 75 d B, 120 d B, 130 d B, and 140 d B. Only the low SPL case of 75 d B is located in the linear regime. Since no reference location for the SPL is given in th e paper, it is assumed that those values refer to the position of the front plate, i. e. lref = 0 (see Eq. (4.01)). The CFD simulations are performed on a 3-D grid with around 1.08 million cells. Sub- ﬁgures 4.02 a and 4.02 b depict gain and phase of the reﬂection co eﬃcient R for both the measurements [20, Fig. 12 a] and the simulations. The reﬂecti on coeﬃcient is transformed to the normalized impedance, which is shown in Subﬁgs. 4.02 c a nd 4.02 d. In comparison to the measurements, the numerics over-predict the resistanc e very slightly for the 130 d B 4.02 Incompressible CFD Simulations case and moderately for the 140 d B case. The lower resistance values in the experiment might (at least partially) originate from non-perfectly sh arp edges due to manufacturing reasons, cf. Tournadre et al. Besides that small deviation in the resistance for hig h SPLs, all curves agree reasonably well. It can be concluded t hat the CFD setup presented is capable of capturing the acoustics in both the linear and t he nonlinear regime. It is competitive against other CFD approaches, where par tially larger deviations from the experiment are present. The expected physical behavior from the 1-D consideration in Sec. 2.05 ﬁts well to the impedance and reﬂection coeﬃcients presented in Fig. 4.02. Th e resistance rises with in- creasing SPL as seen in Fig. 4.02 c. The eigenfrequency can be de tected by the zero-crossing of the reactance. In Fig. 4.02 d, it can be observed that the eige nfrequency shifts slightly to higher frequencies with higher SPLs. The zero-crossing o f the 140 d B reactance curve is at a noticeably higher frequency in comparison to the othe r curves. This nonlinear be- havior manifests itself in the corresponding reﬂection coe ﬃcient as follows (see Figs. 4.02 a and 4.02 b): First, the maximal absorption increases with SPL i n the lower SPL range. When the normalized resistance exceeds unity, the maximal ab sorption decreases due to over-damping of the system, but the frequency bandwidth of h igh absorption becomes wider. For such an over-damped system, the phase curve diﬀer s from a normally damped system, see Fig. 4.02 b. All ̸ R-curves show that the f- and g-waves are in phase for fre- quencies far away from the eigenfrequency. Close to the eige nfrequency, these waves are in antiphase for normally damped systems, whereas they are i n phase for over-damped systems. 4.02 Incompressible CFD Simulations It may be surprising for non-acousticians but incompressible CFD simulations can be employed to acoustically characterize devices that are com pact (see Sec. 2.05). This means that their geometric dimensions are small in comparison to t he acoustic wavelengths for the frequency range of interest. In many cases, the incompre ssible framework allows for a simpler and more robust simulation setup in comparison to t he compressible setup. Jaensch et al characterized the thermoacoustic response of ﬂames ba sed on incom- pressible simulations. In the ﬁeld of aeroacoustics, Mart´ ınez-Lera et al successfully combined incompressible CFD and vortex sound theory to a two-dimensional laminar ﬂow through a T -joint. This methodology is further improved and applied to corrugated pipes by Nakibo˘ gluet al and to a large oriﬁce conﬁguration with through-ﬂow by L a- combe et al for whistling prediction. In contrast to those previou s works, the present study focuses on both the linear and the nonlinear regime of He lmholtz resonators in absence of mean ﬂow. This method can be extended to the case wi th a mean ﬂow due to the general formulation and arguments presented by Nakibo˘ g lu et al and Golliard et al. The study by Tournadre et al (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 74ﬀ.) shows the potential of incompressible simulations to study the aeroa coustic response of a Helmholtz resonator. Here, the Helmholtz resonator is segregated into t he neck and the backing volume as suggested by Ingard and Ising, see also Fig. 2.03 in Sec. 2.05. This study CFD Simulations of Acoustic Resonators demonstrates that this segregation approach works not only in the linear but also in the nonlinear regime if the amplitudes in the simulations are se t correctly. The incompressible simulations are excited by a velocity perturbation. The non linear eﬀects are triggered by the ﬂow separation process at the neck, which is governed b y the particle velocity in the neck. Hence, it is essential to set the amplitude of the v elocity excitation such that the velocity in the segregated neck coincides with the v elocity in the neck in the composed resonator. Therefore, the SPL in the segregated sy stem diﬀers in general from the SPL in the composed system. The overall impedance of the r esonator is determined by assembling the neck transfer impedance and the surface im pedance of the backing volume, see Eq. (2.029). Following this scaling rule, a good a greement of the incompressible simulations with both the compressible simulations and exp eriments can be achieved. The advantage of the simpler incompressible simulation fra mework is exploited by Caeiro et al. In this study with a contribution of the present author, an adjoint approach is used to formulate an optimization procedure for the shape of the resonator neck. This procedure enables to determine a neck contour which exhibit s a desired target impedance at a speciﬁc frequency and SPL. 5 Aeroacoustic Characterization of Nonlinear Eﬀects by Harmonic Probing The behavior of resonators is commonly determined by harmonic probing. Here, a sinusoidal signal—with a certain frequency and amplitude— excites the device acousti- cally. The studies summarized in this chapter apply this tec hnique to explore aspects of the nonlinear behavior of the resonator response. In addi tion, analytic considerations conﬁrm the results. In Sec. 5.01, the impact of the edge shape o f the neck on the reﬂection coeﬃcient and the impedance is investigated in the nonlinea r regime for Helmholtz res- onators. Scattering to higher harmonics is analyzed for bot h Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators in a second study presented in Sec. 5.02. 5.01 Inﬂuence of Edge Shape on the Flow Separation and the Damping Behavior As explained above, the nonlinear eﬀects in the resonator res ponse originate mainly due to ﬂow separation at the edges of the resonator. Laudien et al showed that the shape of the edge inﬂuences the damping performance of a resonator. M urray et al investigated the change of the damping performance due to the manufacturi ng process. They concluded that the acoustic resistance is strongly inﬂuenced by small variation of the edge shape. Earlier, Disselhorst and Wijngaarden observed in a simi lar conﬁguration—in an open pipe—a very signiﬁcant impact of the edge shape on its acoust ic behavior. For an oriﬁce, Temiz et al focused on the transition behavior from the linear to th e nonlinear regime and detected a strong eﬀect of the edge shape on the damping. T hey related this eﬀect to the vena contracta factor Cd (see Sec. 2.05) induced by the contour of the oriﬁce. F¨ orneret al (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 83ﬀ.) quantitatively in vestigate the impact of the edge shape of Helmholtz resonators by means of bo th CFD simulations and measurements. The measurements are conducted by M. A. Temiz a t TU Eindhoven. Here, diﬀerent samples with sharp edges and with 45 ◦–chamfers are considered, as depicted in Fig. 5.01. The results of both methods agree qualitatively wel l, even though the absolute values of the resistance slightly disagree in the nonlinear regime. In spite of this noticeable deviation, the following conclusions can be drawn based on b oth methods: With increasing length of the chamfer, the eigenfrequency of the resonator i ncreases. This corresponds to a reduction of the eﬀective length, meaning that the mass tak ing part in the oscillation reduces with the length of the chamfer. More prominently, th e nonlinear resistance is Aeroacoustic Characterization of Nonlinear Eﬀects by Harmoni c Probing lcf g 45◦ Figure 5.01: Helmholtz resonator with a chamfer of length lc at the edges of the neck. reduced by the presence of a chamfer. This eﬀect is almost ind ependent of the length of the chamfer. This behavior can be explained by studying th e contraction of the jet in the neck. In the ﬂow visualization for the sharp edge cases, a huge separation zone at the leading edge is observed, which correlates with a vena contracta factor Cd ≪ 1. In presence of a chamfer, this zone is noticeably reduced cor responding to a contracta factor close to unity, Cd ≈ 1. The contraction detected in the CFD simulations agrees reasonably well with the reduction in the resistance and wit h literature values for the static vena contracta factors. 5.02 Scattering to Higher Harmonics As mentioned above, scattering to higher harmonics may take place for resonators op- erating in the nonlinear regime. This means that the resonat or is excited harmonically at an angular frequency ω01 and the spectrum of the response comprises of the con- tent not only of this fundamental harmonic ω0, but also of the higher harmonics n ω0, (n = 2, 3, ). The scattering to higher harmonics is rarely studied in th e literature for resonators. For an oriﬁce, which is closely related to the Hel mholtz resonator, this scatter- ing was studied experimentally and analytically by Ingard a nd co-workers as well as by Cummings. An Odd-Harmonics-Only (OHO) pattern in the higher harmonics was observed, where only the odd harmonics ( n = 1, 3, 5, ) are present in the response. This observation could be explained by a quasi-steady analy sis based on the Bernoulli equation, see Eq. (2.033). In a supervised thesis of the prese nt author, Mages studied this equation numerically reformulated in terms of Riemann invariants f and g. He also retrieves the OHO pattern also in this formulation of the prob lem. F¨ orneret al (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 91ﬀ.) extend the quasi- steady ap- proach from the literature such that it can also b e applied to Helmholtz resonators with an asymmetric neck, or for quarter-wave res onators. Moreover, compress- ible CFD simulations are conducted to study this phenomenon f or the conﬁgurations mentioned. The nonlinear contribution to the pressure drop over the neck of a Helmholtz resonator can be approximated as 1 /2 ρ0 (1/(Cd σ) u′)2, according to Eq. (2.033). The main impact of a one-sided chamfered neck is the diﬀerent con traction of the ﬂuid jetting through it, see Sec. 5.01. For the modeling, a constant vena co ntracta factor C+ d is as- 1 In this section, the excitation frequency is clearly marked by the subscript 0 to avoid confusion with frequency content at higher harmonics. 5.02 Scattering to Higher Harmonics √Cd d 0 (a) Symmetric neck. √ C− d d 0 √ C+ d d 0 (b) One-sided chamfered neck. √ C+ d d 0 √ C− d d 0 (c) Quarter-wave mouth.

(Reproduced from.) sumed during the inﬂow and a constant—but possibility diﬀer ent—factor C− d during the outﬂow phase. This is sketched schematically for the three c ases considered in Fig. 5.02. The analysis of the Fourier transformed nonlinear pressure drop term predicts that the OHO pattern is pronounced if C+ d and C− d are similar. Conversely, if these factors diﬀer from each other, the OHO pattern weakens. To study the scatter ing to higher harmonics for the quarter-wave resonator, an analogous analysis is pe rformed for the area jump. Here, the analysis predicts that the second harmonic is the do minant higher harmonic. These analytical predictions are conﬁrmed by CFD simulation s. Exemplarily, CFD results are presented in Fig. 5.03 for three test cases: Two Helmholtz re sonators—one with a sym- metric as well as another one with an asymmetric neck—and a qu arter-wave resonator. Aeroacoustic Characterization of Nonlinear Eﬀects by Harmoni c Probing The incident SPL is ﬁxed for the frequency variation present ed and ˜ω0 denotes the ex- citation frequency normalized with the corresponding eige nfrequency. In this ﬁgure, the proportions scattered in the ﬁrst ﬁve harmonics, deﬁned as |ˆg(n ω0)|⏐ ⏐ ⏐ˆf(ω0) ⏐ ⏐ ⏐, (5.01) are plotted. For the fundamental harmonic ( n = 1), this is equivalent to the reﬂection coeﬃcient. The major part of the incident harmonic wave is re ﬂected into the fundamental harmonic. For the Helmholtz resonator with symmetric neck, t he odd harmonics ( n = 3, n = 5 ) clearly dominate over the even harmonics, see Fig. 5.03 a. As pr edicted by the quasi-steady analysis, this OHO pattern gets weaker for the Helmholtz resonator with an asymmetric neck (see Fig. 5.03 b) and totally vanishes for th e quarter-wave resonator, where the 2 nd harmonic is the dominant higher harmonic (see Fig. 5.03 c). However, the scattering to higher harmonics remains overall on a mode rate level for the Helmholtz resonator. For the quarter-wave resonator, a higher propor tion is scattered into the higher harmonics (up to 15 % for high SPL). 6 Aeroacoustic Characterization by Data-Based Reduced-Order Modeling This chapter summarizes the work on the ﬁeld of data-based reduced-order modeling and positions it brieﬂy in the literature context. The aim is to d etermine a reduced-order model (ROM) which can be evaluated eﬃciently while reproduc ing the essential system dynamics correctly. Models derived from ﬁrst principles ar e referred to as white-box mod- els, as for instance the models for the resonator dynamics prese nted in Sec. 2.05. In the following, a diﬀerent methodology is applied: the models ar e developed based on data series using SI methods. Since usually a model structure is s peciﬁed without considering explicitly the physics or the governing equations involved, such a model is called a black- box model. The data are acquired by CFD simulations excited with a broad band signal covering the entire frequency range of interest. Hence, the ov erall procedure is referred to as CFD/SI method. This method gives good results in various aero- and thermoa coustic setups, especially in the linear regime, see Polifke fo r a review on the work done in his group or Innocenti et al applying this approach on a preferably premixed ﬂame. With this approach, not only transfer functions but also aero - or thermoacoustic sources for the noise can be estimated in parallel. For instance, Sov ardi et al character- ized the scattering behavior and the noise source of an oriﬁc e in presence of low Mach number mean ﬂow. Selimefendigil determined nonlinea r models for heat sources us- ing diﬀerent model structures such as artiﬁcial neuronal ne tworks. However, Jaensch and Polifke demonstrated the high uncertainty which can b e involved in nonlinear iden- tiﬁcation processes if only relatively short time series da ta are available. Hence, attention regarding the robustness and the validation of the estimate d models is required, especially for nonlinear models. As mentioned above, the approach is bas ed on broadband excita- tion. Broadband characterization for oriﬁces and resonato rs is also considered by other authors. In both experiments and DNS simulations, Tam et al excited a resonator by a long broadband signal and determined the linear frequen cy response by using the discrete Fourier transform. Bod´ en applied a high -amplitude signal triggering nonlinear eﬀects at an oriﬁce. By assuming a physically moti vated model structure, the linear and the nonlinear contributions were separated. Aeroacoustic Characterization by Data-Based Reduced-Orde r Modeling 6.01 Linear System Identiﬁcation and Prediction Er- ror Method The idea of SI is to estimate a ROM based on broadband time seri es which comprises of input and output data. In this work, only single-input/si ngle-output (SISO) systems are considered. The method is brieﬂy introduced in the discr ete time framework since measurements and simulations can only provide sampled, i. e. as discrete time series. The time series is assumed to be sampled equidistantly with a constant time step ∆ t. The discrete time index k denotes the sample for the instant in time tk = k∆ t. In the application at hand, the sampled f- and g-wave time series are the input and output data. Any discrete LTI system (with input f[k] and output g[k]) can be written as A(q−1) gmodel[k] = B(q−1) F (q−1) f[k] + C(q−1) D(q−1) e[k], (6.01) where A, B, C, F, and D are polynomials in the time shift operator 1 q. Such a polynomial acts as a digital ﬁlter, hence the eﬀect of the polynomial B with the degree nb applied on f[k] can exemplarily be written as B(q−1)f[k] = ∑ nb i=0 biq−if[k] = ∑ nb i=0 bif[k − i]. A fraction of two polynomials, say ( B/F ) f[k], can be evaluated by polynomial expansion leading possibly to a ﬁlter with an inﬁnite number of ﬁlter co eﬃcients being applied on f[k] even for ﬁnite polynomial orders. The variable e[k] stands for a white noise source, which is uncorrelated to the input. When the non-deterministic out put of the model is colored, meaning that the corresponding signal has a non-constant sp ectral density, at least one of the polynomials A, C, or D diﬀers from unity. Usually, some polynomials are set to unity when speciﬁc phenomena are considered. Moreover, the polyn omial orders of the remaining polynomial have to be ﬁxed before the SI process, which requi res some phenomenological understanding of the problem and/or an iterative procedure. All polynomial coeﬃcients are collected in the vector of unknowns θ. The task in the SI process is to estimate the optimal values of parameter ˆθ. For that purpose, the time series data of the CFD simulation are used as so-called training data set. The parameters ˆθ are usually determined by least square method such that the d iﬀerence of the model output gmodel[k](θ) deﬁned in Eq. (6.01) and of the measured CFD output g CFD[k] is minimized: ˆθmodel = argmin θ ∑ k (gmodel[k](θ) − g CFD[k])2. (6.02) This approach to predict the free model parameters is called the prediction error method (PEM), see Tangirala. An estimated model in the discrete time domain can be converted into other domains. Therefore, the z-transform Z is introduced, which can be considered as the “discrete Laplace transformation”. The variable z is deﬁned as z = exp( s∆ t), where s is the Laplace variable. The z-transformation of the discrete time input signal f[k] reads as: Z{f[k]}(z) = Fz(z) = ∞∑ k=0 f[k]e−k ∆ t s = ∞∑ k=0 f[k]z−k. (6.03) 1 Example for the time shift operation: q− 1 f[k] = f[k − 1]. 6.02 Linear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Resonators Applying the z-transform to B(q−1)f[k], yields Z{B(q−1)f[k]}(z) = ∞∑ k=0 ( nb∑ i=0 bif[k − i] ) z−k = b 0 ∞∑ k=0 f[k]z−k + b 1 z−1 ∞∑ k=0 f[k − 1]z−(k−1) +. = B(z−1) Fz(z). (6.04) The polynomial B(q−1) in the time shift operator q−1 just transforms into a polynomial B(z−1) with the same coeﬃcients in the z-domain. Using the bilinear (Tustin) approxima- tion, transfer functions in z can be transformed into the Laplace domain and vice versa, see. Overall, the model estimated is also valid for dec aying or increasing amplitudes. Thus, a model of the type deﬁned in Eq. (6.01) is well suited for performing stability analysis. 6.02 Linear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Res- onators The SI procedure brieﬂy described in Sec. 6.01 is applied on th e input/output data from CFD simulations of the acoustic resonators (see Sec. 4.01). In this section, only the linear response is considered, i. e. the resonators are excited wi th suﬃciently low amplitudes. The entering f-wave serves as the input and the reﬂected g-wave as the output. Hence, models for the reﬂection coeﬃcient R are estimated. In the aeroacoustic modeling of resonators, no colored noise is expected in absence of turbulent mean ﬂow. Consequently, a model structure with A = C = D = 1 is selected, which is called an output-error (OE) model. This model is presented as a block diagram in Fig. 6.01. CFD/SI wi th a second-order OE model gives good results in the linear regime, see F¨ orner and Polifke (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 83ﬀ.). Exemplarily, Fig. 6.02 presents the frequency responses of estimated OE models for four test cases. The models agree wel l with measurements from Hersh et al and Temiz, which are also included in this ﬁgure. Th e estimated models can be converted into impedance models. However, the r esistance values can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from measurements due to the ill-conditioned conversion for frequencies apart from the eigenfrequency, see Sec. 2.03. In a successive study, F¨ orner and Polifke show f[k] gmodel[k] e[k]OE B F Figure 6.01: Block diagram of an output-error model reproduced from.

Figure 6.02: SI-estimated ( ) and measured ( ) reﬂection coeﬃcient R for four test cases indicated by the colors. (The presented ﬁgure is simil ar as in.) that this approach can also provide local-linear models in t he nonlinear regime. Such a local-linear model is a linear model suitable for a ﬁxed ampl itude range in the nonlinear regime. 6.03 Nonlinear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Res- onators The linear CFD/SI approach introduced in Sec. 6.02 is now exten ded into the nonlinear regime. Only a very limited number of linear black-box model structures are available and the output-error model structure is found to provide quanti tatively accurate estimated models for the Helmholtz resonator dynamics in the linear reg ime. Contrary, there exists a large variety of nonlinear models which can be used for SI. R epresentatives of nonlinear black-box models are Volterra series as well as artiﬁcial ne ural networks. These model types are in principle capable of modeling various non linear behavior. However, for the test cases considered, a huge number of model paramet ers is required such that identiﬁcation results achieved with reasonably long time s eries are not robust. Therefore, F¨ orner and Polifke (reproduced in the Append ix on p. 110ﬀ.) introduce a gray-box model structure that exploits a priori knowledge of the system dyn amics. Neuro- fuzzy networks oﬀer the opportunity to incorporate such kno wledge in the model structure, see, e. g. Nelles or Babuˇ ska and Verbruggen. Suc h a network is developed for modeling the speciﬁc case of the resonator. It is referred to as local-linear neuro-fuzzy network (LLNFN) and its block diagram is sketched in Fig. 6.03. Sev eral output-error models OE i (i = 1, 2, N ) form the skeletal structure of the network. These submodel s are wired via a so-called fuzzy-neuron layer to the input channel f[k]. The input signal 6.03 Nonlinear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Resonators f[k] Fuzzy-neuron Linear gmodel[k] e[k] µ1 µ2 µN OEN OE 2 OE 1 layer layer Figure 6.03: Block diagram of a local-linear neuro-fuzzy model with outp ut-error blocks (see Fig. 6.01) as submodels; reproduced from. is distributed within this layer over the submodels dependi ng on the RMS of the velocity at the reference surface. The RMS of the velocity (for a ﬁxed g eometry) seems to be the parameter controlling the nonlinear behavior also in the ca se of non-harmonic excitation, as suggested by Bod´ en. Each submodel has its neuron which applies a membership function µi to the input signal. This membership function takes a value w ithin the interval depending on the RMS of the particle velocity. If this RMS v alue agrees exactly with or diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the reference velocity uref,i of the membership function µi, it takes the values true and false corresponding to 1 and 0, r espectively. However, the membership function cannot only yield the values “true” (1) and “false” (0), as in Boolean logic, but also every intermediate state in the inte rval [0, 1], as in fuzzy logic. A common-sense interpretation of the role of the membership function is developed as follows (for N = 3): If the amplitudes are low, the ﬁrst model OE 1 is taken to describe the resonator behavior. The second model OE 2 is considered in the medium amplitude regime and model OE 3 in the high-amplitude regime. This decision is made not in a s trict but in a fuzzy way, which means that the response can be formed proportionally by more than one model OE i. For instance, a linear combination of OE 1 and OE 2 is used in the low-medium amplitude regime. An iterative procedure to train LLNFNs is developed and applied to several test cases. The input signal is designed in a way that it contains the enti re frequency and amplitude range of interests. The quality of the estimated models is as sessed in both the time and the frequency domain. The response of the estimated models i s computed for a second independent input signal, which was not used to train the mod el. The validation against test data is an important step in SI to ensure that estimated models do n ot suﬀer from over-parameterization. A model is denoted as over-parameterized when it has so many free parameters that it can, on the one hand, achieve a good ﬁt to the training data thanks to the large degrees of freedom, but gives, on the other hand, poor predictions for another set of input data, the test data [108, p. 133]. The estimated m odels perform competitively well on the test data set for all test cases studied. Hence, the LLNFN model is deemed robust against over-parameterization. Using the describin g functions for the reﬂection coeﬃcient and the impedance, the estimated models are compa red against measurements from Hersh et al and Temiz. Besides small deviations for very high a mplitudes, good agreement is achieved for all test cases studied.

The estimated LLNFN models can be evaluated eﬃciently in the en tire frequency and amplitude range they have been trained for. Figure 6.04 presen ts, exemplarily for a test case, a describing function for the reﬂection coeﬃcient R in a frequency range [200, 800] Hz and a SPL range [80, 140] d B in 5 d B steps. It can be observed that the impedance cha nges smoothly with SPL and frequency, which makes this model attr active to serve as a bound- ary condition in CFD or CAA simulations. Using a linear model ins tead would require that this model is adapted a priori to the conditions and a lin ear model can never re- ﬂect changing conditions by its design. Moreover, the LLNFN mo del structure makes a model—once estimated—readily available also for other ti me steps or in Laplace do- main. Each submodel can be converted to a function in the Lapl ace variable s by the Tustin transformation z → s (see Sec. 6.01). By another reverse transformation s → z, the estimated model can be applied for ﬁxed time step of arbit rary size. Alternatively, the boundary condition can directly operate with the model r epresentation in Laplace domain, which has the advantage that the time step can v ary within the simulation. Such possibilities are in general not given by other nonline ar models applied in SI, e. g. by artiﬁcial neural networks. Moreover, the provided procedure could support the design of future resonators. When the designer has access to a validated CFD setup for resonator simulations, he/she can rapidly estimate how geometrical, ﬂow, or temperature cond itions inﬂuence the linear and nonlinear resonator behavior, since only one CFD simulat ion is required. Thus, this procedure can also be used for the uncertainty quantiﬁcatio n of the resonator response. It is known that, for instance, the manufacturing process of ac oustic liners strongly impacts the actual damping behavior, see Murray et al. With the proposed method, one could quantify with low computational eﬀort how the manufacturin g tolerances inﬂuence the damping performance. 7 Summary and Conclusion The present thesis addresses the nonlinear damping behavior of acoustic resonators such as quarter-wave and Helmholtz resonators. This nonlinear beh avior originates from ﬂow sep- aration at the edges of the resonator openings in the presenc e of high acoustic amplitudes. In particular, this thesis focuses on the following aspects : high-ﬁdelity ﬂuid dynamic sim- ulations of such devices, gathering in-depth knowledge abo ut the nonlinear mechanisms, and the data-based, reduced-order modeling of this behavio r. First, a parametric study by F¨ orner et al accomplished with a low-order network model in the frequency domain is presented. Special attenti on is paid to the impact of the resonators on the linear stability of the system. It is observed that well-tuned resonators signiﬁcantly increase the stability margins. T his tuning process is most eﬃcient if the overall coupled system formed by the combustion chamb er and the resonators is considered. The resonators are described by a local-linear impedance model, which can reﬂect the impact of high sound pressure level by an appropri ate constant resistance term. The stability margins show a high sensitivity towards this t erm, emphasizing the need for accurate modeling of the nonlinear eﬀects. This need bec omes even more evident for simulations in the time domain, where the SPL can change rapi dly such that local-linear models cannot be applied. In major parts of the thesis, high-ﬁdelity compressible ﬂuid dynamic simulations are con- ducted, see. The results presented are inde pendent of mesh and solver setting. In absence of a mean ﬂow, sub-grid scale modeling in large eddy simulations has a minor impact on the acoustic damping in the simulations as l ong as the Stokes layer and the edge regions, where the ﬂow separates, are highly res olved. As an alternative to the compressible approach, the nonlinear behavior can also be characterized by incom- pressible simulations. This study was conducted in col laboration with J. Tournadre and P. Mart´ ınez-Lera from Siemens Industry Software in Leu ven, Belgium. A Helmholtz resonator is segregated in its acoustically compact neck an d its backing volume. While the backing volume can be modeled analytically in a linear fashi on, the behavior of the neck is simulated including the nonlinear eﬀects present. In the in compressible simulations, it is essential to set the input velocity such that the velocity in the segregated neck agrees with the velocity in the composed resonator. Obeying this scalin g rule, the overall impedance is given by the assembly of the transfer impedance of the segr egated neck and the surface impedance of the backing volume also in the nonlinear regime. In collaboration with M. A. Temiz, I. Lopez Arteaga, and A. Hirsch berg from TU Eind- hoven, the impact of the edge shape on the induced ﬂow and the d amping performance is studied. Two major eﬀects are detected: Firstly, with increasing chamfer size at the edge, the eigenfrequency shifts to higher frequencies, corresponding to a reduction of the eﬀective length used in most impedance models. Secondly and more signiﬁcantly, it Summary and Conclusion is observed that already small chamfers at the edges inﬂuenc e the ﬂow signiﬁcantly. The presence of a chamfer reduces the size of the separation zone at the leading edge corre- sponding to a larger vena contracta factor. By this mechanis ms, the nonlinear resistance is reduced noticeably. The nonlinear aeroacoustic behavior of both quarter-wave and Helmholtz resonators is further investigated with respect to the scattering to high er harmonics together with the cooperation partners in Leuven mentioned above. These r esonators are acoustically excited with harmonic signals varying in frequency and ampl itude and the spectrum of the reﬂected wave is evaluated. For the Helmholtz resonator, a pattern in the harmon- ics—named OHO pattern—is observed where only odd harmonics a re present in the scat- tered harmonic. This pattern is weaker if the neck of the reso nator is chamfered on one side. For the quarter-wave resonator, the OHO pattern totall y vanishes. This observation in the simulations is substantiated by a quasi-steady analy sis. In this analysis, it is shown that OHO pattern occurs due to the ﬂow symmetry present for the Helmholtz resonator. The main achievement of this thesis is the development of dat a-based reduced-order mod- els (ROMs) for the reﬂection behavior of acoustic resonator s. In the post-processing of ﬂuid dynamic simulations, system identiﬁcation technique s are used to estimate ROMs based on the simulation data acquired. For the identiﬁcatio n of a linear model, the res- onator is excited with a low-amplitude broadband signal cov ering the entire frequency range of interest. Based on the input data and the detected re ﬂection, a linear model for the reﬂection coeﬃcient is developed. Here, a second-order o utput-error model structure is adopted. This auto-regressive structure can paramet rize a digital ﬁlter with an inﬁ- nite number of ﬁlter coeﬃcients using ﬁve parameters. A good agreement of the frequency responses of the estimated models with measurements is achi eved. Hence, such models can be employed for the stability analysis performed by othe r tools. Hereby, the models can be transformed to digital ﬁlters with diﬀering sampling rates or in other domains as the Laplace domain to satisfy the requirements of the analys is tools. The system identiﬁcation approach is extended into the nonl inear regime. For that purpose, a gray-box model structure, named local-linear ne uro-fuzzy network (LLNFN), is developed, suited for the speciﬁc setup of the resonator r eﬂection. The model consists of output-error submodels, which are wired via fuzzy neuron s to the input channel. Based on the root mean square of the particle velocity in the resona tor neck, the input signal is distributed into those submodels. In the simulation prov iding the data for the training of the model, the amplitude of the excitation signal is succe ssively ramped up such that the entire amplitude range of interest is covered. A procedu re training the model without bias is developed. The estimated nonlinear models are prove n to be robust against over- parameterization. Evaluating describing functions for th e reﬂection coeﬃcient and the impedance, a good agreement with measurements has been achi eved for all test cases considered. Moreover, the sampling rate of the estimated mo del can be adapted to another rate since all linear submodel can be transformed easily. Ov erall, such LLNFN models can support stability analysis in the nonlinear regime, since t hey oﬀer a high accuracy along with low numerical costs. Hence, they can serve as an acoustic nonlinear boundary in ﬂuid dynamic or aeroacoustic simulations. Furthermore, th e eﬃcient and robust nonlinear characterization makes this approach also feasible to supp ort the resonator design in an early stage of development. 7.01 Mapping the Inﬂuence of Acoustic Resonators on Rocket Eng ine Combustion Stability The results of the author’s work have been published in sever al papers. The key papers with the original abstracts and the respective contributio ns of the author are listed in the following sections. 7.01 Mapping the Inﬂuence of Acoustic Resonators on Rocket Engine Combustion Stability A thermoacoustic linear stability analysis of a generic roc ket combustion chamber is con- ducted employing a low-order network model. Special attent ion is paid to the modeling of the resonator ring, as presented in Sec. 3.02. Original Abstract:A mode-based, acoustic low-order network model for rocket c ham- bers with resonator ring is introduced. This model involves eﬀects of dissipation as well as scattering and mode coupling associated with a resonator ring. Discontinuities at the interface between acoustic elements are treated with integ ral mode matching conditions. Eigenfrequencies and accordingly the linear system stabili ty can be determined with the generalized Nyquist plot method based on the network model. D ue to low computational cost, parameter studies can be performed in a reasonable tim e. An additional chamber eigenmode is observed for well-tuned resonators. Both the o riginal and the additional mode show favorable stability properties for a generic test chamber. The optimal length and number of cavities are identiﬁed for that chamber. The ne ed of analyzing the coupled system of resonators and combustion chamber in the design pr ocess is made evident by the discrepancy between detected values and those of an a pri ori consideration. Derived stability maps demonstrate that the region of stable operat ion is increased considerably by inserting well-tuned resonators. The destabilizing inﬂ uence of temperature deviations in the cavities is quantiﬁed. Such sensitivities to modiﬁca tions of design conditions can be extenuated by a ring conﬁguration with several non-identic al resonator types. Moreover, the strong impact of the nonlinear correlation factor in the resonator modeling on the overall system stability is worked out. Contribution:The low-oder tool by C´ ardenas Miranda and Polifke was f urther developed by the author. The simulations were conducted and the manuscript was drawn up by the lead author.

Summary and Conclusion 7.02 Determination of Acoustic Impedance for Helmholtz Resonators Through Incompressible Unsteady Flow Simulations A technique for the nonlinear aeroacoustic characterizati on of a Helmholtz resonator by incompressible simulations is developed, see Sec. 4.02. The proposed procedure is based on the segregation of the resonator into its components, as exp lained in Sec. 2.05. Original Abstract: The present study investigates the physics of Helmholtz reso nators under a large range of excitation amplitudes through an appr oach based on incompressible computational ﬂuid dynamics simulations. By doing so, this work proposes and assesses an alternative approach to the more widespread one based on com pressible ﬂow simulations to analyze the non-linear regime of Helmholtz resonators. In the present methodology, the resonator is decomposed into its two main components: an assumed incompressible oriﬁce neck and a compressible backing volume. The transfer impedance of the single oriﬁce is obtained by means of an incompressible solver of th e ﬂow equations without turbulence modeling, whereas an analytical model accounts for the compliance of the gas in the backing cavity. The proposed methodology is compared for validation purposes to both numerical results of the full compressible equation s and experimental data for the complete resonator at diﬀerent SPLs. The agreement betw een the results of the two numerical approaches is found to be good. Numerical results m atch also fairly well with experimental data but a systematic over-prediction of the r esistance by simulations is observed. Accounting for the presence of micro-rounded edge s, presumably present due to manufacturing processes, allows a better agreement betwee n numerical and experimental results. Contribution:The paper is the outcome of an intensive collaboration with Jo nathan Tournadre from Siemens Industry Software (Leuven, Belgium )/KU Leuven. The com- pressible CFD simulations were performed by the present auth or, while Tournadre con- ducted the incompressible ones. The modeling and the writin g of the manuscript were done by both parties involved to an equal extent. Status:Published in AIAA Journal.

Blunt resona tor edges reduce the separation zone in comparison to a sharp contour, leading to a signiﬁcan t reduction of the nonlinear resistance, see Sec. 5.01. Original Abstract:This study investigates the eﬀect of edge proﬁle of a Helmholt z 7.04 Scattering to Higher Harmonics for Quarter-Wave and Helmho ltz Resonators resonator neck in non-linear regime by means of experiments and large eddy simulations. The dissipation mechanisms in a Helmholtz resonator diﬀer si gniﬁcantly, depending on the sound pressure level. At low levels, i. e. in the linear r egime, thermo-viscous eﬀects are responsible for the dissipation of the acoustic energy s ince the oscillating ﬂow follows the neck geometry. However, increasing the sound pressure le vel results in ﬂow separation at the edges. At these points, vortices form which convert ac oustic perturbation energy to the hydrodynamic mode. This is a strong non-linear eﬀect i ncreasing the dissipation considerably. To observe this eﬀect, experiments and numer ical simulations are carried out for combinations of various backing volumes, sound pres sure levels, and neck proﬁles. The neck proﬁles are selected as 45 ◦–chamfers due to manufacturing concerns. Hereby, a strong dependence on the edge shape is observed in both expe riments and numerical simulations. The presence of the chamfer reduces the vortex shedding in comparison to the sharp edge signiﬁcantly, which leads to a lower acoustic resistance.

This ﬁnding is conﬁrmed by CFD sim ulation (cf. Sec. 4.01) and quasi-steady analysis (cf. Sec. 2.05). Original Abstract:The nonlinear response of acoustic resonators is investiga ted over a broad range of frequencies and amplitudes. Helmholtz resona tors with a symmetric and with an asymmetric neck, respectively, as well as quarter wa ve resonators are considered. Describing functions for impedance and reﬂection coeﬃcien t of a Helmholtz resonator at various sound pressure levels are determined from compre ssible ﬂow simulation and validated against experimental data. The particular focus of the present study is the non- linear scattering to higher harmonics. For the Helmholtz res onator with a symmetric neck, a distinct pattern in the amplitudes of the higher harmonics is observed, where the odd harmonics dominate the response, while the even harmonics a re almost negligible. Such an “Odd-Harmonics-Only” (OHO) pattern, which was observed prev iously in experiment at oriﬁces, is explained by a quasi-steady analysis based on th e Bernoulli equation, assuming a symmetric ﬂow pattern at the neck. For the Helmholtz resona tor with an asymmetric neck, it is observed in CFD simulations that even harmonics co ntribute noticeably to Summary and Conclusion the resonator response, such that the OHO pattern is less pron ounced. For the markedly asymmetric geometry of the quarter wave resonator, the seco nd harmonic is dominant and the OHO pattern vanishes completely. The quasi-steady analy sis is extended successfully to describe also nonlinear scattering to higher harmonics f or asymmetric conﬁgurations and ﬂow patterns. Overall, the scattering to higher harmoni cs remains on a moderate level even at very high excitation levels for the Helmholtz re sonator conﬁgurations. For the quarter wave resonator, the scattering is more pronounc ed and contributes perceptibly to the response at high excitation amplitudes.

Original Abstract:The dissipation of acoustic energy in Helmholtz resonators i s in- vestigated by means of large eddy simulation (LES) and syste m identiﬁcation. At low sound pressure level, thermo-viscous eﬀects dominate this dissipation. This is linear, i. e. independent of perturbation amplitude. LES/system identi ﬁcation methods are applied in this study to the linear regime. For that purpose, the syst em is interpreted as a single- input / single-output system of two characteristic waves. An Output-Error model for the reﬂection coeﬃcient valid for the whole frequency range of i nterest is estimated from a single LES time series. The resonator admittance and impeda nce are derived from that model. For a set of test cases, comparison against experimen tal results and established models shows good agreement for the gain and phase of the admi ttance as well as of the reactance. The acoustic resistance value is captured wi th good accuracy close the eigenfrequency of the resonator.

I t is shown that even in the nonlinear regime, a linear model is capable of describing th e reﬂection behavior at a particular amplitude with quantitative accuracy. This obs ervation motivates to choose a local-linear model structure for this study, which consists of a network o f parallel lin- ear submodels. A so-called fuzzy-neuron layer distributes the input signal over the linear submodels, depending on the rms of the particle velocity at t he resonator surface. The resulting model structure is referred to as an local-linear neuro-fuzzy network. System identiﬁcation techniques are used to estimate the free para meters of this model from training data. The training data are generated by CFD simulat ions of the resonator, with persistent acoustic excitation over a wide range of frequen cies and sound pressure lev- els. The estimated nonlinear, reduced-order models show go od agreement with CFD and experimental data over a wide range of amplitudes for severa l test cases. Contribution: The author developed and implemented the Local-Linear Neuro -Fuzzy Model. He performed the CFD simulations and wrote the manuscri pt. Status: The paper is published in the Journal of Sound and Vibration. Reference: Forne Polif 17, reproduced on p. 110ﬀ. Summary and Conclusion Bibliography D. Zhao and X. Y. Li.

Mapping the Influence of Acoustic Resonators on Rocket Engine Combustion Stability K. Förner,∗ A. Cárdenas Miranda,† and W. Polifke‡ Technische Universität München, D-85748 Garching, Germany DOI: 10.02514/1.B 35660 A mode-based, acoustic low-order network model for rocket chambers with resonator ring is introduced. This model involves effects of dissipation as well as scattering and mode coupling associated with a resonator ring. Discontinuities at the interface between acoustic elements are treated with integral mode-matching conditions. Eigenfrequencies and accordingly the linear system stability can be determined with the generalized Nyquist plot method based on the network model. Because of low computational cost, parameter studies can be performed in a reasonable time. An additional chamber eigenmode is observed for well-tuned resonators. Both the original and the additional mode show favorable stability properties for a generic test chamber. The optimal length and number of cavities are identified for that chamber. The need for analyzing the coupled system of resonators and combustion chamber in the design process is made evident by the discrepancy between detected values and those of an a priori consideration. Derived stability maps demonstrate that the region of stable operation is increased considerably by inserting well-tuned resonators. The destabilizing influence of temperature deviations in the cavities is quantified. Such sensitivities to modifications of design conditions can be extenuated by a ring configuration with several nonidentical resonator types. Moreover, the strong impact of the nonlinear correlation factor in the resonator modeling on the overall system stability is worked out.

Introduction F EEDBACK between unsteady heat release and acoustics can lead to self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities in rocket combustion chambers. The resulting high-frequency oscillations can lower the motor performance or, due to the high-energy density, even destroy the thrust camber within a short time. Acoustic resonators, such as Helmholtz resonators or quarter-wave length cavities, are commonly used for the dissipation of acoustic energy and detuning the system such that these oscillations are damped. Figure 1 shows a generic combustion chamber with resonators arranged in a ring. The damping behavior of the cavities depends on several design parameters, such as their length, diameter, the number of cavities, etc. Moreover, transient operating conditions such as temperature or the Received 10 November 2014; revision received 20 February 2015; accepted for publication 20 February 2015; published online 20 April 2015.

Identification of an optimal design is not a trivial task because the stabilizing impact can only be estimated in combination with the main driving and damping mechanisms in the chamber (cf. ). An acoustic network model approach has been introduced by Cárdenas Miranda and Polifke capable of analyzing the linear stability of a rocket engine combustion chamber equipped with a resonator ring in the frequency domain. The stability of each mode (composed of axial and tangential contributions) is determined with a generalized Nyquist criterion. Following this approach, the chamber is divided in subsystems or“elements,” which form an interconnected network. Major attention in modeling is put on the resonator ring, which is represented as a duct segment with finite wall impedance. The acoustics within this segment are described analytically. With suitable matching conditions derived from mass and momentum conservation via the Galerkin approach, this model accounts for wave scattering as well as the mode coupling effects to higher radial modes. In this study, this network model is used to analyze the influence of resonator parameters on the overall stability in detail. Quantitative validation against experimental data was not object of the present paper. This would require more sophisticated submodels. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, the network modeling detailed in is summarized and the main features of each element are discussed. The results of an extensive parameter study with focus on the 1 T 1 L mode are presented in Sec. III. The generic test chamber used for the study is introduced first. An optimal tuned resonator ring is sought by variations of the cavity length and the number of resonators. Stability margins in terms of the flame parameters of the undamped chamber are compared with the well-tuned damping case. Moreover, the effect of temperature deviation in the cavities is examined for two configurations: one ring equipped with only one type of resonators and another with differing types but the same total number of resonators. Finally, the influence of nonlinear correlation terms associated with the SPL is investigated before concluding in Sec. IV. II. Low-Order Network Model In this section, the low-order network model of a rocket engine combustion chamber from is presented briefly. This model captures the important thermoacoustic interactions with low computational costs. In the network, the different parts of the combustion chamber are modeled as separate (thermo)acoustic elements as illustrated in Fig. 2. For each such element, the main features are summarized and discussed. By connecting these elements, a linear system is formed, which can be used to find the eigenfrequencies and thus to determine the linear stability of the corresponding eigenmode. A. Duct Segment The three-dimensional, linear acoustic field in terms of the pressure fluctuationp 0 with uniform mean flow in the axial direction v 0 /.0136/.0137 U; 0; 0/.0138 T can be described by the convective wave equation c 2 /.0018∂ ∂t /.0135 U ∂ ∂x /.00192 p 0 /.0136∇2 p 0 (1) Hereby, the viscous dissipation is neglected and a constant speed of soundc is assumed. In a cylindrical duct with radius R, the solution of this equation with harmonic time dependency reads in cylindrical coordinates/.0133 x; r;θ/.0134 as p 0 c 0ρ0 /.0136 X m;n /.0137 Jm/.0133α/.0135 mnr/.0134 Fmne−ik/.0135 mnx /.0135 Jm/.0133α− mnr/.0134 Gmne−ik− mnx/.0138 eiΩteimθ /.0136 X m;n /.0133 fmn /.0135 gmn/.0134 (2) Here, Jm denotes the mth Bessel function of the first kind. The numbers m and n describe the tangential and radial mode order, respectively. The solution can be interpreted as a combination of left and right traveling wavesfmn and gmn. Note that the preceding expression is complex valued with its real part corresponding to the physical pressure. The propagation in thex direction of the corresponding wave is determined by the axial wave numberk/.0006 mnand the mode shape by the radial wave numberα/.0006 mn. These numbers are linked by the dispersion relation /.0133α/.0006 mn/.01342 /.0136/.0133Ω∕c − Mk/.0006 mn/.01342 − /.0133 k/.0006 mn/.01342 (3) where M is the Mach number U∕c. Moreover, the wave numbersα/.0006 mnhave to be determined such that the boundary condition at the duct wall is satisfied. These conditions are usually given in terms of an acoustic impedance Z, which is the ratio of the fluctuating pressure^p 0 and velocity normal to the surface ^u 0 ⊥ in the frequency domain: Z/.0133ω/.0134/.0136 ^p 0 ^u 0 ⊥ /.0136Θ /.0135 iΨ (4) The real part Θ (the so-called resistance) mainly describes the dissipative effects, whereas the imaginary partΨ (the reactance) describes the phase shift or time delay. In the presence of axial mean flow, the boundary conditions for p 0/.0133 x; r;θ/.0134 are given by Myers as − iΩ ρ ∂p 0 ∂r /.0136 /.0018 iΩ /.0135 U ∂ ∂x /.00192 p 0 Z/.0133Ω/.0134 (5) For a hard-wall boundary condition with Zjr/.0136 R /.0136∞, this sim- plifies to d dr /.0020 Jm/.0133αr/.0134 /.0021 r/.0136 R /.01360 (6) with the real-valued, frequency-constant solutions α/.0135 mn/.0136 α− mn/.0136/.0006λmn∕R, whereλmn denotes thenth root of/.0133 d∕dr/.0134 Jm. For a duct with finite shell impedance, the situation changes: The solutions are complex valued as well as frequency dependent and α/.0135 mn≠ α− mn holds. In this case, the wave numbers have to be determined by solving the nonlinear equation numerically, which arises by inserting the analytical solution (2) and the dispersion relation (3) into the Myers boundary condition (5).

This transfer matrix is given as Tmn /.0136 /.0020 e−ik/.0003/.0135 mnΛ 0 0 e−ik/.0003−mnΛ /.0021 (8) It is obvious that, in such a duct, only transmission takes place, without any reflection or scattering, neither into the same mode nor into any other mode. B. Resonator Ring In the network model, the resonator ring is modeled as a duct segment with finite shell impedance. At connections of duct segments with differing shell impedances, appropriate matching conditions have to be set. Here, a Galerkin-based approach is used to satisfy mass and momentum conservation in a weak sense. In the present report, only the main ideas behind this resonator ring model are given (for details refer to ). A common model for the impedance of the mouth of the quarter- wave length resonator with diameterd and length l, as shown in Fig. 1, is given by Laudien et al as ZR /.01362 /.0018 1 /.0135ϵnl /.0135 lr d /.0019/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 2μRρRΩ p − icρ cot /.0018 Ωle c /.0019 (9) The reactance of this model is described in an analytical way, whereas the resistance is determined empirically. The so-called nonlinear factorϵnl has to be determined experimentally in dependence on the SPL. The lengthlr describes the corresponding length to the effective mass (in analogy to the Helmholtz resonator). The effective length le /.0136 l /.0135δl (δl ≈ 0.042 d ) is slightly larger than the geometric length, because it accounts for the fluid in front of the resonator mouth taking part in the resonator oscillation. The dynamic viscosity at the resonator opening is denoted withμR and the density withρR. Because the duct model introduced earlier can only deal with duct segments with a homogeneous shell impedance, it is reasonable to define an equivalent impedance Zeq Zeq Aref /.0136 /.0018 X j Aj Zj /.0019−1 (10) Here, Zj corresponds to the impedance at the area Aj and Aref to the total area X j Aj It should be pointed out that this approach can formally handle resonator rings with several resonator types. This is reasonable as long as the assumption of a homogeneous wall impedance is valid (i.e. there are not too many different resonator types and they are mounted well distributed around the circumference). Having set the homogeneous shell impedance, the transfer matrix can be computed as discussed in Sec. II.A. At the interface between the hard-wall and finite shell impedance duct segment, transmission, reflection, and radial mode coupling occur. As shown in, these effects are considered in appropriate mode-matching conditions, which can be derived from mass and momentum conservation on a control volume enclosing the connection. For every tangential orderm, these quantities can only be conserved in a weak integral sense with weighting functions Ψmν/.0133 r; θ/.0134, ν /.01361;: : :; N. Decreasing the volume thickness to zero, only surface and line integrals remain. For the coefficients qh /.0136/.0137 Fh m 0;G h m 0;F h m 1;G h m 1;: : :; Fh m N;G h m N/.0138 T; qs /.0136/.0137 Fs m 0;G s m 0;F s m 1;G s m 1;: : :; Fs m N;G s m N/.0138 T (11) on the hard- and soft-wall side, the linear system Qsqs /.0136 Qhqh (12) follows, where Qs and Qh are square 2 N × 2 N matrices (cf. ). With Ψmν /.0136 Jm/.0133λmνr∕R/.0134, the matrix Qs is of block-diagonal structure due to the orthogonality of the Bessel functions. The transfer matrix connecting a hard-wall segment with a soft-wall segment is given as Tsh /.0136/.0133 Qs/.0134−1 Qh and, analogously, Ths /.0136 /.0133 Tsh/.0134−1 for a connection, vice versa. In total, the transfer matrix of the resonator ring is given as Tring /.0136 Tsh Ts Ths (13) where Ts is the transfer matrix of the soft-wall segment of the resonator. In contrast to a simple duct segment, scattering (i.e. reflection and transmission of acoustic waves), as well as coupling of radial modes of different orders, take place here. Thus, these effects are considered in addition to the direct dissipation of acoustic energy in the following stability analysis. C. Injector Plate, Flame, and Nozzle Because this study focuses on accurate modeling of the resonator ring, relatively simple models for the injector plate and the combustion process are used. Nevertheless, it is possible to capture the main driving and damping effect with these models. At the injector plate, the acoustic mass flow fluctuations are assumed to be zero/.0133ρ1 u 1/.01340 /.01360. Consequently, the acoustic behavior is given by /.0133κ/.0135 mn/.0135 M/.0134 fmn /.0135/.0133κ− mn/.0135 M/.0134 gmn /.01360 (14) with κ/.0006 mn/.0136 k/.0006 mn ω∕c /.0135 Mk/.0006 mn (15) The flame is modeled in an thermoacoustic element of zero thickness with the well-known sensitive time lag model proposed by Crocco _Q 0 _Q /.0136 n/.01331 − eiΩτ/.0134 p 0 u pu (16) This “n − τ model” relates the relative pressure fluctuationp 0 u∕pu on the cold, upstream side to the relative heat release_Q 0∕ _Q with a time lagτ and an interaction indexn.

This admittance model incorporates the flow with Mach number M, isentropic exponentγ, and the mode shape/.0133 m; n/.0134, as well as the nozzle geometry. The geometry is described by the radii of curvature at the nozzle entrance rin and at the throatrout, as well as by the nozzle half-angleθnozzle. For detailed discussion on the influence of the nozzle modeling refer, for example, to. This model reflects the strong frequency-dependent damping of the nozzle accurately and is thus more sophisticated than the choked nozzle approach used in. D. Determination of the Eigenfrequencies Putting all acoustic elements together, the acoustic system can be described as a linear system with a system matrix A/.0133Ω/.0134 for each frequency Ω. To get nontrivial solutions, it is necessary that ker/.0133 A/.0133Ω/.0134/.0134≠ f 0 g. So, a resonant eigenfrequencyΩeig has to satisfy det/.0133/.0133 A/.0133Ωeig/.0134/.0134 /.01360. Having determined such a complex-valued eigenfrequency Ω /.0136ω /.0135 iϑ, the linear stability of the corresponding eigenmode is designated by the sign of its complex partϑ, since p 0 ∝ e−ϑt. The growth rate per cycle T is given as Γ /.0136 e−ϑT − 1 /.0136 exp /.0018 −2π ϑ ω /.0019 − 1 (19) This expression takes negative values for positiveϑ and vice versa. The eigenvalues determine the three-dimensional corresponding mode shapes. In this study, the focus is put on the stability analysis. For typical mode shape refer to. The determination of the eigenvaluesΩeig is a nonlinear problem. Thus, in general, it is very laborious to find these values directly by root-finding methods. Thus, the graphical Nyquist plot method based on the generalized Nyquist criterion is used to approximate them. For this purpose, a Nyquist element is added to the network as illustrated in Fig. 2. Here, one channel (e.g. for the right traveling waves) is directly connected, whereas the other channel is cut. Now, the open-loop transfer function (OLTF) can be defined as OLTF/.0133Ω/.0134/.0136− fu fd (20) This function maps the complex plane uniformly on itself. In particular, all eigenfrequenciesΩeig are mapped on the critical point −1 /.01350 i. By mapping the real-valued, positive frequenciesω on the open-loop transfer function curve OLTF/.0133ω/.0134, the eigenfrequencies can be estimated by finding those frequenciesωmin where the OLTF curve has a local minimal distance to the critical point. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3. The valueωmin corresponds to the real part of an eigenvalue. The magnitude of its imaginary part can be estimated by the distance Smin to the critical point scaled with 1∕σ, where σ /.0136 lim Δω→0 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 OLTF/.0133ωmin /.0135Δω/.0134− OLTF/.0133ωmin − Δω/.0134 Δω /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012(21) And so, Ωeig ≈ ωmin /.0135 i sign/.0133 RHS/.0134 Smin σ where the signsign/.0133 RHS/.0134 has to be determined using the right-hand side (RHS) rule. In, a polynomial fit to the discrete OLTF curve is proposed to determine the eigenvalues. For a linear fit, this reads as Ωn ≈ωmin /.0135 isign/.0133 RHS/.0134 2 j SminjΔω j OLTF/.0133ωmin /.0135Δω/.0134−OLTF/.0133ωmin −Δω/.0134 j (22) It should be mentioned that the preceding estimation is more accurate if the partial eigenvalue is located close to the real axis (i.e. at small growth or decay rates). Thus, the determination of the sign, which determines the stability of a mode, is very accurate. In the case of very high nominal growth or decay rates, quantitative accuracy decreases, whereas the trend is reproduced correctly. In, a comparison of the Nyquist method using the linear fit with a direct root-finding method ofdet/.0133 A/.0133Ω/.0134/.0134 is given for a rocket combustion chamber, which shows that the Nyquist method provides reasonable results within this framework. III. Parameter Study As mentioned earlier, low-order models offer the advantage of low computational cost, such that extensive parameter studies can be performed. In this section, the influence of several parameters associated with the acoustic resonator ring is studied. In particular, the influence of the cavity lengthl, the number of cavitiesn R, mean temperature deviationΔT in the cavities, and the nonlinear factorϵnl are examined by way of example. Stability maps are presented for both the undamped and damped case (i.e. combustion chamber without and with resonators). Such studies are important because the mounting of resonators can change the mode shapes and thus can also affect the damping and driving mechanisms significantly. In other words, the resonator design cannot be based solely on the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies of the undamped chamber, but requires the study of the coupled system“chamber with resonator” to capture all interactions taking place (see, e.g. ). A. Generic Combustion Chamber A generic combustion chamber is defined, which is used for the semi-analytical studies on the stabilizing influence of the resonator ring. This chamber has radius R and length L. At distancex F from the injector plate, the compact combustion front is located with excess temperatureΞ /.0136 Td∕Tu − 1. Further downstream, the resonator ring is placed withn R cavities and center locationx R. If not mentioned explicitly, each of these cavities has the same lengthl and diameterd. All geometrical parameters are nondimensionalized with the chamber radius R. All following eigenfrequenciesΩ /.0136ω /.0135 iϑ and time-dependent quantities are normalized with the real part of the 1 T 1 L eigenfrequency ωref of the undamped chamber. Values for all parameters are listed as follows: R /.01361, L /.01361.026, x F /.01360.011, x R /.01360.015, d /.01360.0078, l /.01360.044, n R /.013622, ϵnl /.013665, rin /.01362.059, rout /.01360.097, θnozzle /.013625, Ξ /.013612, γ /.01361.013, n /.01361.05, τ /.01363.010. In this study, N /.01368 radial modes were considered in the mode matching at the resonator interfaces (Sec. II.B). The Nyquist plot for the tangential orderm /.01361 of the undamped chamber is shown in Fig. 4, where the curve describes clockwise circles by increasing the frequency. The three points on the OLTF curve with minimal distance to the critical point−1 /.01350 i correspond to the 1 T, 1 T 1 L, and 1 T 2 L eigenmodes. The 1 T mode is located at the cut-on frequency of the first tangential order where the OLTF curve has its only discontinuity. The second detected mode 1 T 1 L is unstable. Later, the curve approaches the origin, which is an outcome of the damping induced by the nozzle increasing with the frequency. Thus, the 1 T 2 L is very clearly in the stable regime. This physical Fig. 3 Mapping of ω to the OLTF curve; reproduced from. 1162 FÖRNER, CÁRDENAS MIRANDA, AND POLIFKE Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on July 9, 2015 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.B 35660 A.1 Mapping the Inﬂuence of Acoustic Resonators on Rocket Engi ne Combustion Stability effect of high damping for high frequencies is not incorporated in the choked nozzle approach used in. The eigenmodes of this chamber without resonator ring are presented in Table 1. The 1 T 1 L mode is most unstable for this configuration with a growth rate of 4.092%, whereas the others are relatively stable. Thus, the following stability analysis is based on this mode. Studies for other modes can be performed in an analogous manner. Inserting the well-tuned reference resonator ring in the combustion chamber stabilizes the 1 T 1 L mode; see the values for the undamped case in Table 1. Note that the formerly unstable 1 T 1 L mode has been split into two modes 1 T 1 Lα and 1 T 1 Lβ of similar frequency when the resonator ring is inserted in the chamber. This behavior will be explained in Sec. III.B. B. Cavity Length The cavity length has a major influence on the damping behavior because the cavity eigenfrequency is given asf R;k /.0136/.01332 k /.01351/.0134 c R∕ /.01334 le/.0134, k /.01360; 1; 2;: : :. In Fig. 5, the real partω and imaginary partϑ of the 1 T 1 L eigenfrequency are plotted, respectively. It can be observed that the 1 T 1 L eigenmode splits into two modes when the resonator eigenfrequency is close to the eigenfrequency of the coupled system. This behavior has already been seen by other authors for experimental as well as numerical setups (cf. ). Both modes are always more stable than the undamped 1 T 1 L mode, whose stability marginϑref is shown by a horizontal black dashed line in Fig. 5 a. Not only the stability but also the physical frequencies change. For very short cavity lengths, the mode is hardly influenced: Eigenfrequency and corresponding stability are almost the same as for the undamped case. Increasing the cavity length toward the optimal length causes a decrease in eigenfrequency and increase in stability. Close to the optimal length, the second, so-called 1 T 1 Lβ mode appears. Both the original 1 T 1 Lα and the 1 T 1 Lβ modes are considerably more stable. One of them exhibits a lower and the other a higher frequency than the undamped 1 T 1 L mode (see Fig. 5 b). The optimal cavity lengthlopt is reached where the twoϑ curves in Fig. 5 a intersect. Further increase of the cavity length away from this optimal length leads on the one hand to a further stabilization of the original 1 T 1 Lα mode until it disappears completely. On the other hand, the second mode 1 T 1 Lβ tends to be more and more unstable and asymptotically approaches both the stability margin and the frequency of the undamped 1 T 1 L mode. The observed shift in the real part of the eigenfrequencyω is the reason why here and in the following figuresϑ is plotted instead of the growth rateΓ. The growth rate Γ is defined per cycle T which is changing withω, whereasϑ is independent of T and thus more reasonable for comparison in this context. For the chosen parameters, the optimal damping is achieved with a cavity length oflopt ≈ 0.0438, which was also chosen for the reference resonator configuration. For lengths in a range aroundlopt, the 1 T 1 L eigenmodes remain stable (i.e.ϑ > 0). A priori, the optimal length can be estimated using the real part of eigenfrequencyωref from the undamped analysis. Accordingly, the estimated length would be lest /.0136 c R∕/.01334ωref /.0134− δl /.01360.0454. This estimated length from the decoupled analysis is also shown in Fig. 5 a with a black dashed line. It can clearly be seen that, for optimizing the resonator design, only the coupled system provides accurate results. In this case, the a priori optimal length is already slightly in the unstable region (see Fig. 5 a). The effect of splitting eigenmodes is also illustrated by the Nyquist plot in Fig. 6. For well-tuned resonators, a loop appears in the OLTF curve such that two points with minimal distance to the critical point occur instead of one for the undamped case. These two minima correspond to the two eigenmodes 1 T 1 Lα and 1 T 1 Lβ. For a cavity length slightly smaller than lopt, this loop is located at a higher frequency than the original eigenmode frequency. The longer the cavities are, the lower the corresponding frequency of the loop location is. In the complex plane, this cavity length increment corresponds to a counterclockwise movement of this loop. For cavity lengths far away from the optimal length, this loop disappears again. C. Number of Cavities Another major design parameter is the number of cavitiesn R mounted in the resonator ring. The configuration remains unstable when only few resonators (n R < 8) are inserted (see the solid curve in Fig. 7 a). Whenn R is increased, the original 1 T 1 L mode is more and more stabilized. But for larger values ofn R/.0133> 15/.0134, the second 1 T 1 L mode is detectable, which gets less stable by further increasingn R and is very close to the unstable regime fromn R /.013636 onward (see the dashed red curve in Fig. 7 a). The generic test chamber is most stable forn R /.013619. For the reference resonator ring configuration, n R /.013622 cavities were selected because this number is located in the optimal region. The corresponding real parts of the eigenfrequencies are plotted in Fig. 7 b. D. Stability Map The stability map of the 1 T 1 L mode is shown in Fig. 8 in dependency on the flame parametersn and τ. The solid curve marks the transition from the stable (below) to the unstable regime (above) for the undamped chamber. The shape of the curve can be explained by the definition of the flame model used [Eq. (16)]. Understandably, the mode tends to be more unstable for higher interaction indices because this directly increases the driving influence. The time lagτ causes the largest amplification when it matches the eigenfrequency ωsuch thatτω ≈ π. The reason why the most unstable operating point is not directly located atτωref /.0136π is that the system eigenfrequency slightly changes with variation of the time lagτ. This is compared with the damped case with the well-tuned reference resonator ring. The resulting stability margins are marked by the dashed red line in − 1 0 1 − 1 − 0.05 0.05 Re(OLTF) Im(OLTF) Fig. 4 Nyquist plot of the first tangential mode for the undamped chamber.

A significant increment of stable operation range can be observed clearly. As explained in Sec. III.B, the 1 T 1 L mode splits into two modes. Here, only the dominant (i.e. more unstable)1 T 1 L mode is plotted. This explains the appearance of the sharp corner at aroundn ≈ 2.003 and τ ≈ 3.041, where the stability margins of the 1 T 1 Lα and 1 T 1 Lβ modes meet and the dominance switches from one to the other mode. E. Temperature The cavity eigenfrequency depends linearly on the mean cavity speed of soundf R ∝ c R. Changing the mean cavity temperature TR detunes the cavity eigenfrequency, sincec R ∝ /.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 TR p. This effect is also reflected in the coupled analysis. In Fig. 9, the imaginary and real part of the dominant 1 T 1 L eigenfrequency are plotted against the deviation of mean temperature in the cavitiesΔT with the solid lines, where ΔT is normalized by the design temperature in the cavities. As expected, the configuration tends to be less stable apart from the design temperature (see Fig. 9 a). An often used design criterion is the absorption coefficient α/.0133Ω/.0134/.01361 − /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 Z/.0133Ω/.0134− ρRc R Z/.0133Ω/.0134/.0135ρRc R /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 (23) This coefficient can be seen as the ratio of the dissipated acoustic energy to the incident acoustic energy. By definition, the maximum absorption factor is unity. This coefficient is plotted over the frequency for the reference configuration with the solid line in Fig. 10. The absorption is highest close to the reference frequency and decays rapidly apart from it. A possibility to reduce the sensitivity to deviations of the design value is to modify the ring such that more than a single resonator type is used. In the modified ring, the same number of cavities is mounted but the length of six resonators is elongated and the length of another six is shrunk by 10%.

By changing the temperature, all eigenfrequencies shift. With different cavity lengths in the array of resonators, the likelihood grows that one type matches the coupled eigenfrequency and thus damps efficiently. The absorption for the modified resonator ring is also shown in Fig. 10 with a dashed curve. It is still maximum close to ωref but a good performance close to the eigenfrequencies of the additional resonator types is realized. Thus, with such a modification, the range of high absorption can be broadened efficiently but with a slightly lower maximal absorption. The modified resonator ring achieves the requested stabilization also in the coupled analysis (see the red dashed curves in Fig. 9). It can be clearly observed that the stable range is increased by this a modification (see Fig. 9 a). F. Nonlinear Factor In the impedance model of the quarter-wave resonator introduced in Eq. (9), the nonlinear factorϵnl plays an important role. The empirical correlation term accounts for nonlinear damping mechanisms due to flow separation at the cavity mouth. At high SPLs, this mechanism dominates the linear, viscous damping and, consequently, the resistance is mainly determined by that factor in this regime.

When increasing this term, the system stabilizes significantly until a saturation is reached at ϵopt ≈ 100. Subsequently, the system is overdamped and the stability drops down again and even becomes unstable for very high values of ϵnl (see Fig. 11 a).

Some measurements with Helmholtz resonators from for the nonlinear factor ϵnl in dependency on the SPL are summarized in Fig. 12. A considerable scatter can be observed. This underlines that such a factor has to be determined for the specific geometric setting, because a transfer from another setup might be defective and the overall stability is influenced in a sensitive manner by such incertitude. Valid impedance models require robust estimates for the occurring SPLs and a correlation that is valid for the geometry under consideration. IV. Conclusions A low-order network model of a complete rocket engine combustion chamber has been presented. Hereby, the chamber has been divided into several elements, in which the linear acoustics have been modeled separately. Matching conditions have been set up at the interfaces of duct segments with different shell impedances. Following the Galerkin approach, mass and momentum conservation across the interface has been guaranteed in a weak sense. These conditions also have included scattering and mode coupling effects at the resonator ring. Stability analysis has been performed using the generalized Nyquist criterion to determine the eigenfrequencies. This procedure has been applied to perform an extensive parameter study and generate stability maps. First, the analysis has been carried out for the cavity lengths. When the resonator eigenfrequencies have been close to an eigenfrequency of the coupled system, the process has been stabilized and a splitting of this chamber eigenfrequency has occurred. The damping effect of cavities with matching lengths has become apparent. Moreover, it has been observed that, in general, the resonator design according to the undamped system is not sufficient. Instead, the coupled system of the chamber and the resonators has to be taken into account. To achieve optimal damping, only a moderate number of cavities has turned out to be needed. Deviations in mean temperature from the design condition have shown a clear destabilizing impact due to the modification of the speed of sound within the cavities. Inserting a set of nonidentical resonators has observably lowered this undesired effect. A strong impact of the nonlinear acoustic dissipation parameter on the overall stability has been observed, which occurs due to flow separation at the cavity mouth at high SPLs. This has emphasized the need for the knowledge of occurring SPLs and of accurate modeling of this nonlinear effect for the specific geometric setting.

Desmet¶ KU Leuven, 3001 Leuven, Belgium DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055337 The present work proposes and assesses a methodology based on incompressible computational fluid dynamics simulations to study the acoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators under a large range of excitation amplitudes. It constitutes an alternative approach to the more widespread one based on compressible flow simulations to analyze the nonlinear regime of Helmholtz resonators. In the present methodology, the resonator is decomposed into its two main components: an assumed incompressible orifice neck and a compressible backing volume. The transfer impedance of the single orifice is obtained by means of an incompressible solver of the flow equations without turbulence modeling, whereas an analytical model accounts for the compliance of the gas in the backing cavity. The proposed methodology is compared for validation purposes to both numerical results of the full compressible equations and experimental data for the complete resonator at different sound pressure levels. A good agreement between the results of the two numerical approaches could be achieved. Numerical results match also fairly well with experimental data, but a systematic overprediction of the resistance by simulations is observed. Accounting for the presence of microrounded edges, presumably present due to manufacturing processes, allows a better agreement between numerical and experimental results.

Introduction A COUSTIC damping systems, such as Helmholtz resonators, perforated liners, and quarter-wavelength cavities, are commonly used in multiple industrial applications to reduce sound transmission and to control acoustic feedback that can lead to instabilities, for instance, in combustion systems like aeroengines or gas turbines. When designed properly, such devices dissipate the acoustic energy at a specific bandwidth. The behavior of such an acoustic damper is often characterized by its acoustic impedance, which is defined in the frequency domain as the ratio of the pressure to the normal acoustic velocity. The acoustic dissipation mechanisms, and therefore the impedance values, differ significantly depending on the amplitude of the acoustic excitation. For low excitation amplitudes, the viscous dissipation dominates. In this case, the impedance is independent of the sound amplitude, and the resonator or orifice behaves like a linear system. Numerical methods based on linearized equations, like the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, allow for an efficient treatment of this linear regime with limited computational costs. By increasing the excitation amplitudes, nonlinear effects appear and become progressively dominant. Such nonlinear effects originate from flow separation at the neck of the resonator, which transfers acoustic energy to the hydrodynamic field.

This feature is of importance for the design of acoustic dampers, as it impacts substantially the sound wave attenuation. The nonlinear regime is, however, more complex to predict accurately due to the intricate nature of the physical phenomena taking place. Linear numerical methods are therefore not suitable at medium and high excitation amplitudes, and nonlinear time domain solvers are needed. The present work investigates the capability of an incompressible unsteady computational fluid dynamic approach to study numeri- cally the aeroacoustic response of a Helmholtz resonator to an external acoustic excitation. Different sound pressure levels (SPLs) are included in this study to cover the different regimes of an investigated Helmholtz resonator. Incompressible flow computations have already successfully been used in the past to characterize the acoustic behavior of confined flow systems. In the work of Martínez- Lera et al, an approach combining incompressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and vortex sound theory was applied successfully to a two-dimensional laminar flow through a T joint. This methodology was further improved and applied to corrugated pipes by Nakiboğlu and to a large orifice configuration with through flow by Lacombe et al for whistling prediction. In contrast to those previous works, the present study focuses on both linear and nonlinear regimes of Helmholtz resonators in the absence of mean flow. The extension to the case with flow can be done easily due to the present general formulation and arguments presented by Nakiboğlu and Golliard et al. Section II explains in detail the methodology applied here for the numerical acoustic characterization of a Helmholtz resonator. The numerical setup and the postprocessing steps used to determine the surface impedance of the resonator are described. In Secs. III and IV, the results for the impedance describing functions estimated by the proposed approach are shown for the linear and nonlinear regimes, respectively. In both cases, the results are compared to impedance values obtained using compressible flow computation of the complete resonator and validated against measurements data. Section V concludes this paper with an overview of the main observations of this study. II. Description of Methodology and Case Study A. Decomposed Helmholtz Resonator The basic idea of using an incompressible solver to study the acoustic behavior of a Helmholtz resonator, placed at the termination of a duct as depicted in Fig. 1 a, appears as a contradiction at first thought. The incompressible nature of the fluid violates indeed the principle of mass conservation if a nonzero inlet velocity is prescribed at the open side of the duct closed by the resonator, which makes impossible the direct study of this configuration by incompressible CFD simulation. The methodology proposed here to face this issue is to decompose the complete Helmholtz resonator into its two main components: the orifice neck and the backing cavity (see Fig. 1 b). Such a decomposition has already been proposed by Ingard and Ising. For most of the configurations of interest, the orifice can be considered acoustically compact; i.e. the Helmholtz number He, which describes the ratio of the neck length or diameter to the acoustic wavelengthλa, is small (He ≪ 1). Thus, the flow through the orifice can be treated as incompressible. The compressible effects occur solely in the backing volume. The orifice transfer impedance Zo is often used to quantify the acoustic behavior of an orifice. It is defined as the ratio of the Fourier component (superscript^·) of the fluctuating pressure dropΔ ^p 0 /.0136 ^p 0 1 − ^p 0 2 and velocity normal to the reference surface in the duct front of the resonatoru 0, i.e. Zo /.0136 Δ ^p 0 ^u 0 (1) Note that in the previous definition the velocity^u 0 is the cross- sectional surface averaged velocity in the resonance tube. There are other authors using the cross-sectional surface averaged velocity in the orificeu 0 o instead. These two velocities are related via the porosity of the resonator plateσ, such thatu 0 /.0136 σu 0 o. The porosity is defined as σ /.0136 So∕Sbc, with So and Sbc denoting the cross-sectional areas of the orifice and backing cavity, respectively. The contribution of the backing volume can be described in terms of a surface impedance, Zbc /.0136 ^p 0 2∕^u 0 2, which is done here analytically, as described in Sec. II.A.2. The orifice transfer impedance can therefore be expressed as Zo /.0136 ^p 0 1 − Zbc ^u 0 ^u 0 (2) Because of the acoustically compact neck and the same areas on both sides of the orifice, it is reasonable to assume^u 01 /.0136 ^u 02. Thus, the surface impedance of the resonator Zr is given in this lumped model as (cf. Ingard and Ising ) Zr /.0136 Zo /.0135 Zbc (3) The present study builds on this Helmholtz resonator decomposition and aims to investigate the validity of this decomposition at different levels of sound excitation. In doing so, the advantages of an incompressible solver are exploited for the simulation of the flow through the orifice, including the vortex generation responsible for the nonlinear acoustic losses. Details on the estimation of the orifice transfer impedance and backing volume surface impedance are given in the following sections. 1. Orifice Impedance Zo The methodology to get the orifice transfer impedance from the incompressible simulations is explained in this section. In the plane wave regime, a one-dimensional approximation along the duct is possible, and the area-averaged absolute pressure at several sections of the duct is stored at each time step of the flow simulation. This allows computing the pressure differences between two arbitrarily chosen sections separated by the orifice:Δp AB /.0136 p A − p B is the pressure jump (or loss) between the sections A on the inlet side and B on the outlet side (see Fig. 2). a) Complete helmholtz resonator b) Decomposition into oriﬁce and backing volume Fig. 1 Sketch of the considered geometry and reference cut planes 1 and 2 for the decomposed resonator model. 2 Article in Advance / TOURNADRE ET AL.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) is related to the acoustic power in an inviscid and homentropic flow according to Howe’s energy corollary. The third term describes the viscous dissipation effects. The total pressure differenceΔP between two sections can be expressed as the sum of two distinct contributions: ΔP /.0136 ΔPpot /.0135 ΔPs. The pressure differenceΔPpot is related to a potential flow solution [first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4)], which would be the solution in the absence of vorticity and viscous effects, whereasΔPs is linked to sink/source terms for the sound with both vorticity and viscous effects taken into account [last two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (4)]. In the numerical models, the viscous dissipation at the walls of the main duct is neglected, and slip boundary conditions are applied. As a consequence, the vorticity and viscous effects can be neglected for the wave propagation in the ducts so thatΔPduct;s /.0136 0 inside the duct segments. In the one-dimensional approximation, ΔPpot can be expressed as ΔPpot /.0136 −ρ Z L ∂ux ∂t dx (5) with L the total length between the two sections,x the coordinate along the duct axis, andux the axial component of the velocity at thex location (see Fig. 2). Inside the duct segments,ΔPduct;pot can be interpreted as a result of the propagation along the duct of the fluctuation in velocityux. The pressure losses can be divided spatially between ducts and orifice parts, leading to (6) with ΔPAB the total pressure losses between the measurement sections A and B andΔPduct the total pressure losses in the two duct segments. From this, the expression to compute the orifice pressure dropΔPo is ΔPo /.0136 ΔPAB − ΔPduct;pot (7) There are two different ways to determine the orifice transfer impedance values from the measured pressure time series, depending on whether the potential flow pressure loss correction inside the duct is done directly on the pressure time data, or in the frequency domain on the impedance itself. Those two approaches to estimate the orifice impedance from the pressure and velocity time series are schematized in Fig. 3. In approach 1, the impedance due to the duct potential pressure loss Zduct;pot is subtracted from the total measured impedance Ztot to estimate the transfer impedance from the orifice Zo as Zo /.0136 Ztot − Zduct;pot (8) For an orifice of thicknesslo placed between the measurement sections A and B, as illustrated in Fig. 2,Zduct;pot is computed as Zduct;pot /.0136 jρω/.0133 LAB − lo/.0134 u 0 (9) where LAB is the distance between the measurement sections A and B, u 0 is the velocity perturbation inside the duct parts,ω is the angular frequency, andj is the imaginary number /.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 −1 p. In approach 2, the duct pressure loss is directly subtracted from the time pressure data. Asu 0 does not depend on the positionx in the duct segments, one gets ΔPduct /.0136 ρ/.0133 LAB − lo/.0134 ∂u 0 ∂t (10) where ∂u 0∕∂t can be computed analytically for harmonic excitation inlet velocity or has to be computed numerically from the velocity time series in case of broadband excitation. 2. Backing Volume Impedance Zbc The contribution of the backing volume can also be described in terms of a surface impedance Zbc /.0136 ^p 0 1∕^u 0 2, which can be determined through an analytical model. Two analytical expressions for the backing volume are shown here. Using the one-dimensional acoustic equations, the impedance is given as Zbc /.0136 −j cot/.0133 klcav/.0134ρc (11) where k denotes the wave numberk /.0136 ω∕c, c is the speed of sound in the medium, andlcav is the length of the backing cavity. When the whole volume is compressed and expanded simultaneously, the following expression for the impedance can be derived using the isentropic compressibilityβ ≡ 1∕/.0133ρc 2/.0134: Zbc /.0136 −j ρc 2 Sbc Vω (12) This is the same formulation as in, e.g. Keller and Zauner. Both Eqs. (11) and (12) describe the same behavior forlcav ≪ λa. This can be observed by means of the Laurent series of Eq. (11): Zbc∕/.0133ρc/.0134/.0136 −i/.01371∕/.0133 klcav/.0134 − klcav∕3 − k 3 l 3 cav∕45 /.0135 O/.0133 k 5 l 5 cav/.0134/.0138. The first term of the expansion is identical to the expression in Eq. (12). Note that both expressions deliver a purely reactive contribution from the backing cavity. Equation (12) is used in the present study. B.

This gives a porosityσ of the resonator front plate of 0.071%. Those dimensions have been chosen according to the Ref. corresponding to the case with sharp edges, used for comparison (see Sec. II.C). The original resonator design has a cavity length oflsim∕dcav /.0136 0.04. The extension of the computational domain in the axial directionlsim should be long enough to allow measurement sections to be put out of the area that is influenced by hydrodynamic fluctuations. For the investigated case described through this work, lsim∕dcav equals 10 and has been taken long to allow different measurement sections atx∕dcav /.0136/.0137 /.0006 8; /.0006 6; /.0006 4; /.0006 2/.0138 along the duct for assessment of the methodology. Numerically determined impedance results have been shown independent of the location of the chosen measurement sections after post-processing. This ensures that the impedance results are not polluted due to vortices crossing the measurement sections. The lengthlsim∕dcav /.0136 2 has been found to be sufficient for the investigated geometry at the investigated SPLs, and it reduces considerably the computational cost and time. Figure 2 presents also the boundary conditions used for the unsteady incompressible CFD computations. The wall of the duct is defined as the slip-wall boundary condition. This assumption implies that no boundary layer develops along the duct and that the velocity profile is constant through the section. Such a hypothesis is fair, as it has been observed in various compressible studies, e.g. the large- Eddy simulation (LES) computations performed by Alenius, that changing this boundary condition does not affect the local orifice behavior. This assumption is of importance for the present study, as it allows one to easily discard pressure losses occurring in the duct upstream and downstream of the orifice. The wall of the orifice plate is, however, prescribed as no-slip boundary condition as the resolution of the boundary layers in the vicinity of the orifice is of major importance for a correct orifice impedance estimation. The velocity is prescribed at the duct inlet boundary as a time-dependent harmonic fluctuation with zero mean. Finally, a fixed pressure boundary condition is applied to the outlet side of the duct to close the problem definition. The present approach is limited to cases in which the hydrodynamic vortex structures are contained inside the numerical domain. As the boundary conditions for the incompressible simulations are defined through prescribed velocity and pressure values, vortices crossing the domain limits are not accounted for by boundary treatment. Violation of this rule has shown to deliver inaccurate results as the numerical problem formulation is inconsistent in that case. If vortices approach the in-/outflow boundaries, the computational domain has to be extended. This can be required for configurations with orifices of small diameter at high excitation amplitudes, as for those cases the vortices can travel far away from the production zone. In this work, the incompressible finite-volume solver of a commercial code (ANSYS Fluentv 14∕v 15) is used to characterize the flow. The chosen solver is pressure based, time-dependent, implicit, and second order in time and space. The pressure correction scheme applied is Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations. No turbulence modeling is applied for the presented simulation results as the Reynolds number based on the orifice size and velocity fluctuation amplitude at the orifice is rather low (maximum Re ≈ 3000 at high excitation levels). Turbulence modeling has shownvery limited impact on the estimated orifice transfer impedance under the present operating conditions. Comprehensive parameter studies regarding grid, time step, and solver parameters have been performed to ensure that the presented results are independent of those numerical settings. Standard parameters for the results presented here are the minimal size of mesh cellhmin/.0136 10−5 m,t i m es t e pdt/.0136 10−6 s, number of iterations per time step Niter /.0136 20. Both two-dimensional axisymmetric and three- dimensional simulations have been carried out in this work to investigate three-dimensional effects. C.

I, the results computed from incompressible unsteady CFD simulations are compared to two different data sets: compressible CFD results and experimental data performed on a particular Helmholtz resonator geometry.

To distinguish, for the estimated resonator acoustic impedance, between the possible differences originating from the numerical solvers and from the modeling part, both open-end tube (without accounting for the cavity backing wall) and closed-end tube (Helmholtz resonator) configurations are simulated with the compressible solver. It was also verified that the turbulence modeling leads only to very minor differences. With the turbulence model activated, the acoustic resistance increased slightly. This shows that turbulent structures as represented by the subgrid scale model do not have a significant impact on the separation mechanism itself in the chosen SPL range. In the compressible flow simulations, the computational domain is excited from the boundary opposite to the resonator at a distance lsim∕dcav /.0136 2 by imposing a propagating characteristic wave Fr of amplitude Af. For this purpose, the Navier–Stokes characteristics boundary condition, cf. Poinsot and Lele, is applied. Particular care has been taken to match Af with the value of the amplitude Au in the incompressible flow simulations to ensure the same excitation state of the orifice in both closed and open tubes. The method to define correctly the excitation amplitude is discussed in detail in Sec. II.D. The Fr wave can be imagined as a wave traveling in the right direction toward the orifice location, whereas Gr is the reflected one traveling back to the inlet. Shortly after the inlet, area-averaged pressure and velocity fluctuations were evaluated across a reference plane to determined Fr and Gr time series to evaluate the reflection coefficient Rnum. For those harmonically excited simulations, the reflection coefficient is determined through Rnum/.0133ω/.0134/.0136 ^gr/.0133ω/.0134∕ ^fr/.0133ω/.0134,w i t h angular frequency ω. The reflection coefficient is transformed to the resonator normalized surface impedancezr, using the relation zr /.0136/.0133 1 /.0135 Rnum∕ exp/.0134∕/.01331 − Rnum∕ exp/.0134. 2. Experimental Reference Data In addition to the numerical results, a measurement campaign has been performed by Förner et al at the Eindhoven University of Technology on a Helmholtz resonator configuration. The experi- ments were carried out with an impedance tube in a semi-anechoic chamber. The resonator sample was placed at one extremity of the impedance tube. The measurement data give the surface impedance of the complete Helmholtz resonator. The tube has six BSWA MPA 416 microphones with the average sensitivity of 50.045 m V∕Pa, equally distributed along the 1-m-long tube. The microphones have been calibrated to measure the reflection coefficient Rexp in the frequency range [100–700 Hz]. The numerical work will limit itself to this frequency range. The reflection behavior of the test object has been studied for various SPLs. Data for the cases 89.03 and 119.07 d B are presented here for assessment of the investigated methodology. Those SPL values are controlled over the entire frequency range at a reference position, here the closest microphone from the resonator front plate placed 49.07 mm away. The 89.03 d B case is in the linear regime, while in the 119.07 d B case, nonlinearities are present. D. Setting Excitation Amplitudes For the purpose of comparing results of the incompressible simulations with existing experimental data, it is necessary to ensure that the velocities in the orifice agree with each other for the different setups. This fact is also relevant for comparison with the compressible solver, as the definition of the excitation between compressible and incompressible solvers is fundamentally different. The excitation is given by a time-varying axial velocity fluctuation at the inlet boundary for the incompressible simulations, whereas it is 4 Article in Advance / TOURNADRE ET AL.

The reflection coefficient is therefore a key parameter to match results in the nonlinear regime. This has been found to be a challenge from a practical point of view. Drawing impedance curves from a particular resonator at a certain SPL given at a reference position can also be achieved by the present incompressible approach without any knowledge of intermediate variables such as the reflection coefficient. This requires, nevertheless, in general, several simulation trials for one case, in which the input velocity is progressively modified until the SPL matches the target one. To compare the results from the investigated methodology to existing data sets, the following procedure has been applied, based on the relations between propagating waves Fr and Gr and primitive variables p 0 and u 0. Below the cut-off frequency of the duct, and in the case of no mean flow, the acoustics can be described as the superposition of the Riemann invariants defined by Fr /.0136 1∕2/.0133 p 0∕/.0133ρc/.0134/.0135 u 0/.0134 and Gr /.0136 1∕2/.0133 p 0∕/.0133ρc/.0134 − u 0/.0134.I nt h e resonance tube, a standing wave is developed with a fluctuating pressure at the positionx, p 0/.0133 x/.0134/.0136 ρc/.0137 Fr/.0133 x/.0134/.0135 Gr/.0133 x/.0134/.0138 (13) In the experimental setup, the reference microphone was mounted at a distance oflref /.0136 0.00497 m away from the resonator front face. This is selected as the reference positionxref for the SPL. Moreover, the reflection coefficient R /.0136 Gr∕Fr depends on both frequency and amplitude. The reflected wave at the reference position is thus Gr/.0133 xref /.0134/.0136 R/.0133ω; SPL/.0134 exp/.0133−jω2 lref ∕c/.0134 Fr/.0133 xref /.0134. Accordingly, the fluctuating pressure at positionxref is given as p 0∕/.0133ρc/.0134/.0136/.0137 1 /.0135 R/.0133ω; SPL/.0134 exp/.0133−jω2 lref ∕c/.0134/.0138 Fr/.0133 xref /.0134. Considering the ratio of rms values to harmonic amplitude being 1∕ /.0129/.0129/.0129 p,t h e amplitude Af of the incoming wave Fr /.0136 Af exp/.0133 jωt/.0134 is given as Af/.0136 10 SPL∕20 /.0129/.0129/.0129 p pa j 1 /.0135 R/.0133ω; SPL/.0134 exp/.0133−jω2 lref ∕c/.0134 jρc (14) where pa /.0136 20 μPa is the commonly used reference sound pressure in air. The fluctuating velocity u 0 is given as the difference of the Riemann invariants, i.e.u 0 /.0136 Fr − Gr. Thus, the amplitude of the velocity Au at the resonator mouth position (atxo /.0136 −lo∕2 in this work) can be calculated as Au/.0133 xo/.0134 /.0133ω; SPL/.0134/.0136 Af/.0133ω; SPL/.0134 j 1 − R/.0133ω; SPL/.0134 j (15) For the incompressible simulations, the inlet amplitude prescribed at the inlet boundary is directly given by Eq. (15). For the compressible simulations, in the case of the full resonator configuration, the inlet boundary condition is Af given by Eq. (14). Finally, exchanging the backing cavity with a nonreflecting outlet (Z /.0136 ρc), the amplitude of the Fr wave has to be corrected. The reflection coefficient of the corresponding orifice Ro (i.e. open tube) can be estimated as Ro /.0136 zr − zbc zr − zbc /.0135 2 (16) Thus, the amplitude of the i wave in the open-end tube configuration Af;o should be set as Af;o /.0136 Af j 1 − Rj j 1 − Roj (17) Table 1 lists the values of the different excitation amplitudes needed to ensure the same state at the orifice neck for five frequencies close to the resonator eigenfrequency and for the two investigated SPLs. As the primitive variables and Riemann variables are linked through the reflection coefficient, values of velocity at the orifice coming from the compressible simulations are still slightly different, but these deviations have been judged to have only a small impact on the estimated impedance values. Note that in the linear regime (here at 89.03 d B), even if specific values are given in Table 1, computations give the same impedance values taking different inlet velocity amplitudes, as long as these prescribed excitation amplitudes are small enough to remain in the linear regime of the resonator. III. Results Obtained for Small Excitation Amplitudes: Linear Regime For harmonic pulsating flows at the orifice, the impedance value for each excitation frequency is computed by dividing the Fourier coefficients of the fluctuating pressure loss through the orificeΔ ^p 0 with the velocity perturbation^u 0. Each frequency requires therefore one CFD simulation. The harmonic fluctuating inlet velocity is given for a given angular frequencyω by u 0/.0133 t/.0134/.0136 Au sin/.0133ωt/.0134 (18) where the amplitude of inlet velocity Au is defined as described in Sec. II.D. A. Resonator Impedance in Linear Regime Figure 4 shows the obtained normalized surface impedance curves for the case SPL /.0136 89.03 d Bover the frequency range [100–700 Hz] compared to the experimental data and the values obtained from the system identification of the complete three-dimensional resonator model with the compressible solver. Impedance values are normalized by the characteristic isentropic impedance Z 0 /.0136 ρc. For each simulation set, it is verified that the impedance values are independent of the measurement sections selected for determining the pressure loss. All results show a fair agreement around the Helmholtz resonance frequency f H;lin /.0136 372 Hz in the linear regime. The reactance Im/.0133 zr/.0134 matches well with the experimental data over the entire frequency range. However, one can see that the discrepancies increase slightly with increasing frequency. The incompressible harmonic results lead to a better reactance prediction than the compressible solver far from the resonator eigenfrequency. The same observation can be made on the resistance Re/.0133 zr/.0134. Notice also that both experimental and compressible values present a large error far from the resonance frequency as the impedance values are obtained using the reflection coefficient Rexp or Rnum, so that even a small error on the reflection coefficient gives a larger uncertainty on the impedance in such a condition. This comes from the fact that the transformation from Rexp ∕num to Re/.0133 zr/.0134 is ill conditioned away from the eigenfrequency in the case of the complete Helmholtz resonator, as the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is close to unity at these frequencies. The resistance obtained by incompressible simulations seems a bit lower than experimental data, but the trend in frequency (given by the slope) is well predicted. B. Comparison of Two Approaches in Harmonic Case The two approaches to extract Zo from the incompressible results, as discussed in Sec. II.A, are investigated here in the case of the linear regime with harmonically excited resonator. The difference in concept between those approaches lies in the correction of the Table 1 Example of inlet excitation amplitudes for Fr and u 0 at two different SPLs Frequency, Hz 340 360 380 400 420 SPL /.0136 89.03 d B Af, m∕s 0.00020 0.00033 0.00019 0.00013 0.00011 Au, m∕s 0.00021 0.00043 0.00024 0.00014 0.00009 Af;o, m∕s 0.00076 0.00165 0.00097 0.00057 0.00041 SPL /.0136 119.07 d B Af, m∕s 0.00552 0.00601 0.00574 0.00490 0.00401 Au, m∕s 0.00411 0.00474 0.00471 0.00407 0.00295 Af;o, m∕s 0.01500 0.01823 0.01891 0.01693 0.0130 Article in Advance / TOURNADRE ET AL. 5 Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on October 31, 2016 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055337 Reproduction of Papers pressure losses in the duct segments: in the frequency domain (approach 1) or in the time domain (approach 2). Figure 5 shows that there is a good agreement between impedance values resulting from both approaches. The reactance values in particular are very similar. More discrepancies can be noticed on the resistive part of the impedance with the difference between the approaches growing when the frequency is increasing. It was observed that approach 2 is more sensitive to the simulation parameters (time step, mesh refinement, and dependency of the measurement section) than approach 1, but both approaches converge to the same impedance values. Approach 1 can therefore be favored for its robustness. Those conclusions drawn for the linear regime with harmonic signal excitation have been verified to be valid for the nonlinear regime and for the linear regime with broadband excitation as well. IV. Results Obtained for Higher Excitation Amplitudes This section presents the results obtained for higher excitation amplitudes, where flow separates at the edges of the orifice, i.e. in the nonlinear resonator regime. A. Resonator Impedance in Nonlinear Regime Figure 6 presents the normalized impedance obtained at a SPL of 119.07 d B from the different numerical methods performed on the investigated resonator geometry compared to the experimental data. Three-dimensional simulations have been performed with a much shorter computational domain with lsim∕dcav /.0136 2. The three- dimensional mesh consists of nearly 1.05 million cells. Impedance results from different measurement sections have been shown to be identical. The main conclusion from this work is that the tested numerical models, in spite of their differences in terms of physics and methodology, are in very good agreement. Nevertheless, a systematic overprediction of the resistance compared to experimental results can been seen. The discrepancy is expected to be of physical nature, as mesh/time-step influences have been discarded. The reason for this discrepancy is still under investigation. The comparison of the results for the whole resonator and the results obtained by simulating separately the orifice and the back cavity shows overall that the combined model gives very satisfying results and that this model is still valid for this range of moderately high sound amplitudes. Some small differences between the two- and three-dimensional models can be observed, but the overall impact of three-dimensional effects is rather small, although it clearly increases with increasing velocity at the orifice. The flow visualization (not shown here) suggests that the eddies dissipate in an asymmetrical manner but that this asymmetry does not influence the separation process itself. Thus, the three- dimensional effects are not important from an acoustical point of view for the considered SPLs. For the reactance, numerical and experimental data are very similar, with a very good match of all numerical results. In detail, it seems, however, that the numerical approaches underpredict to some very small extent the reactance, Fig. 4 Normalized resistance Re/.0133 zr/.0134(left) and reactance Im/.0133 zr/.0134(right) of the Helmholtz resonator, obtained with the methodology based on incompressible simulations, compared to experimental data and broadband compressible numerical results (case SPL /.013689.07 d B): ( ) two-dimensional incompressible, ( ) three-dimensional compressible with broadband excitation, and (-×-) experimental data.

When compared to the previous linear regime case, one can note that the reactance is only in a minor way affected by variation of the excitation amplitude. Complementary computations have been run for a different Helmholtz resonator geometry, based on the case studied by Hersh et al (see Fig. 12 a in the referred work), to see if the overprediction in resistance is also present. For this second resonator geometry, the dimensions of the acoustic resonator arelo /.0136 1.059 mm, do /.0136 6.035 mm, lcav /.0136 25.04 mm,a n ddcav /.0136 50.08 mm.F i g u r e 7 shows the comparison of the numerical results from both incompressible and compressible numerical approaches to the experimental data of the literature. The general trends for both resistive and reactive parts with respect to increasing excitation amplitudes are correctly captured by the numerical methods. A good quantitative agreement is also obtained. A shift in the resonance frequency can be clearly observed in Fig. 7, with a growing deviation from its value in the linear regimef H;lin toward higher frequencies for increasing SPLs. This shift occurs due to a decrease of the reactance for increasing excitation amplitudes, which is related to a reduction of the effective length by vortex shedding. Since the neck geometric length is smaller in this case than for the first resonator configuration investigated, this effect is much more visible here. The present cases correspond to high Strouhal numbers Sh ≫ 1,w i t h Sh ∈ /.013725–60/.0138, where Sh /.0136 do /.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 ωρ∕/.01334μ/.0134 p is the ratio of the Stokes layer thickness to the orifice diameter. The physical interpretation of the nonlinear impedance at such high Shear number values was shown to be more complicated than at smaller Sh, due to complex vortex shedding effects, and requires further investigation. The resistance over- prediction from the numerical methods seems to be still present in this case, even if significantly less pronounced. B. Effects of Rounded Edges One possible reason for the systematic difference between experimental and numerical impedance results has been thought to originate from the existence of some rounding of the edges for the experimental Helmholtz resonator test sample. It was already shown in previous works that the presence of chamfers strongly changes the structures of the produced vortices and the resistance at moderate and high excitation amplitudes. In the present study, the size of the considered chamfers is much smaller so that one can speak about microchamfers or microrounded edges. These microrounded edges are investigated as representing more realistic edges, similarly to the ones expected from manufacturing processes. Figure 8 shows the impact of microrounded edges on the impedance for both linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, the microrounded edges affect neither the determined resistance nor reactance. This is expected as the volume of the orifice is not considerably modified by the microchamfering and therefore the reactance, related to the inertial effects, is not altered. The geometrical modification at the orifice edges does not influence the flowpath, producing no change for the pressure drop and therefore no change in the resistance, either. In the nonlinear regime, one can Fig. 6 Comparison of numerical results from the different solvers with experimental data for the case at 119.07 d B: (-×-) experimental results, () two- dimensional incompressible decomposed model, () two-dimensional compressible decomposed model, () two-dimensional full resonator, () three- dimensional incompressible decomposed model, () three-dimensional compressible decomposed model, and () three-dimensional full resonator.

Results for two different rounded edge radii are shown,Rf /.0136 40 μm and Rf /.0136 80 μm, respectively. These radii represent 1 and 2% of the orifice thickness. From those observations, accounting for rounded edges tends to decrease the resistance, delivering a better agreement with the experimental results. After consideration of the rounded edge radius for the actual test sample, which is found to be close to 80 μm, the extent of this change for the present case seems, however, to not fully explain the observed discrepancies in resistance between the numerical and experimental approaches. A rounded edge radius lager than 120 μm would indeed be required in the simulations to equal the experimental resonance peak in resistance. No impact on the reactance can be noticed. Additional flow computations have shown that the impact of rounded edges on the impedance is captured in a similar manner for both compressible and incompressible cases, for both rounded edges and straight chamfer situations. The actual microscale geometry does not change the results significantly. V. Conclusions A method to numerically characterize the aeroacoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators without mean flow has been investigated. Both linear and nonlinear regimes have been studied. A procedure to assess the present methodology, by ensuring the same velocities in the orifice as in compressible flow simulations and experiments, is described in this paper. The impedance values obtained with the incompressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the orifice combined with an analytical backing volume model are in good agreement with results from a compressible simulation of a complete resonator. The numerical results for the resistance in the nonlinear regime show a systematic overprediction with respect to experimental data. The impact of microrounded edges on the estimated impedance has been investigated. Even if the presence of microrounded edges was deemed insufficient to explain alone the discrepancies, such geometrical details were found to affect significantly the computed resonator resistance and should therefore be included for accurate predictions of the acoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators in their nonlinear regime. The presented approach has shown, nevertheless, to give satisfying results for the acoustic impedance of Helmholtz resonators. It is an alternative for the study of the nonlinear regime of such acoustic damping systems. The proposed methodology can be applied for the study of both linear and nonlinear regimes of the Helmholtz resonator with commercial CFD software with moderate computational costs. One of the most significant advantages of this methodology is that it does not rely on the reflection coefficient to estimate the impedance (as in experiments or compressible simulations) and instead the impedance is directly computed from the pressure and velocity. Impedance curves are therefore valid on a broader frequency range than just around the resonator resonance frequency. This approach can be extended to the study of an orifice with bias or grazing flow in a straightforward manner following previous works. In the no-mean-flow case, two possible approaches in the postprocessing of the orifice transfer impedance have been studied. The difference in concept between those approaches lies in the correction of the pressure losses in the duct segments: in the frequency domain (approach 1) or in the time domain (approach 2). A general conclusion is that both approaches investigated in this work lead to similar impedance prediction, but approach 1 has been shown to be more robust. Finally, the possible impact of three-dimensional effects on the impedance results presented in this work has been investigated and judged minor for the applied conditions.

This study investigates the effect of edge proﬁle of a Helmholtz resonator neck in non-linear regime by means of experiments and large eddy simulations. The dissipation mechanisms in a Helmholtz resonator differ signiﬁcantly, depending on the sound pressure level. At low levels, i. e. in the linear regime, thermo-viscous effects are responsible for the dissipation of the acous- tic energy since the oscillating ﬂow follows the neck geometry. However, increasing the sound pressure level results in ﬂow separation at the edges. At these points, vortices form which con- vert acoustic perturbation energy to the hydrodynamic mode. This is a strong non-linear effect increasing the dissipation considerably. T o observe this effect, experiments and numerical simu- lations are carried out for combinations of various backing volumes, sound pressure levels, and neck proﬁles. The neck proﬁles are selected as 45◦–chamfers due to manufacturing concerns. Hereby, a strong dependence on the edge shape is observed in both experiments and numerical simulations. The presence of the chamfer reduces the vortex shedding in comparison to the sharp edge signiﬁcantly, which leads to a lower acoustic resistance. 1. Introduction Helmholtz resonators are passive sound absorbers having a wide range of application areas from ancient Greek theaters to aerospace industry. These resonators are named after the ﬁrst scientist to analyze them theoretically: Hermann von Helmholtz. A Helmholtz resonator is a combination of an air backing volume and an opening, which is referred to as the neck of the resonator. When excited by a pressure perturbation, the air volume acts as a spring due to its compressibility and causes oscillation of the air in the neck. This spring-mass model is introduced by Rayleigh simplifying Helmholtz’s pioneer work. Later, Ingard and Labate observed that there are two main dissipation mechanisms in the Helmholtz resonators. The ﬁrst is due to thermo-viscous boundary layers, which is linear; and the other one is due to vortex shedding, which is non-linear. This non-linear dissipation effect is addressed by Ingard and Ising. They considered the neck separately, performed pressure as well as particle velocity measurements, and observed that this non-linear mechanism causes a decrease in the reactance of the oscillating air within the neck.

(b) Close-up resonator neck. Figure 1: Sketch of the Helmholtz resonator geometry. In 1979, Hersh et al derived non-linear differential equations to model the non-linear response of the Helmholtz resonators. Y et none of the studies mentioned so far focuses on the effect of the edge proﬁle of the neck on the non-linearity of the resonator. In similar conﬁgurations, a huge impact of the edge geometry was observed, see, e. g. the study for a resonance tube by Disselhorst and van Wijngaarden. In this study, three different neck samples are used. One of these samples has the sharp and other two have the 45 ◦-chamfered edge proﬁle in combination with different chamfer lengths. The purpose of the study is to understand the effect of edge proﬁle of the neck on the non-linear response of the Helmholtz resonator. T o achieve this purpose, large eddy simulations (LES) and impedance tube measurements are carried out. The geometry of the Helmholtz resonator domain is sketched in Fig. 1. 2. Modeling of Helmholtz Resonators The dynamic behavior of the Helmholtz resonator is commonly described in frequency domain with its surface impedance Zs. The impedance is deﬁned as the ratio of the Fourier transforms of the ﬂuctuating pressure ˆp ′ to the ﬂuctuating velocity ˆu ′, i. e. Zs(ω) = ˆp ′ (ω)/ ˆu ′ (ω). Thus, the impedance Zs can be seen as transfer function from u ′ to p ′. The real part of the impedance is referred to as the so-called resistance and the imaginary as reactance. Such a description in frequency domain is actually only valid for linear transfer functions. The non-linear dynamic response of resonators is commonly given by describing functions. That means that the impedance is deﬁned depending on the amplitude. This approach neglects higher harmonics. Nevertheless, it reﬂects the major dynamics well. As mentioned above, the behavior of the resonator is often described as mass-spring-damper system and reads as (1)Zs(ω) = Rl + Rnl + i(m ω − K/ω ). Here, the term m accounts for the mass in the neck taking part in the oscillation and K for the compressibility of the backing volume. The variable Rl denotes the linear resistance reﬂecting for the thermo-viscous losses due to friction at the walls of the neck. If the amplitudes are large enough, the ﬂow separates at the edges transforming additional energy to the hydrodynamic mode from the acoustic mode, which is irrotational by deﬁnition. This is a non-linear mechanism depending on the current amplitude and is captured by the term Rnl. All terms in Eq. (1) are determined by analytical models but they also contain some empirical correlation values. According to Keller and Zauner and Garrisonet al, they are approximately given as (2) m = (1 + s) le ¯ρ, K = A¯ρc 2 V, R l = s¯ρ(l 0 + ls)ω, and Rnl = ϵnls¯ρ d 0ω, where the mean pressure, density, and speed of sound are denoted by ¯p, ¯ρ, and c, respectively. The geometry is described by the backing volume V as well as by the neck area A, and length l 0. The 2 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 Reproduction of Papers The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration boundary layer effects are included in the parameter s 1. The effective mass oscillating around the neck is determined by adding a correction to the neck length. Similarly for the viscous losses, l 0 is extended by ls. The non-linear losses are captured by the non-linear correlation factor ϵnl. The angular eigenfrequency of the resonator is given as the ratio of m to K, thus ωeig = c √ A/ (V (1 + s) le). In the following, the impedance Zs is normalized by the free impedance ¯ρc, i. e. Z = Zs/ (¯ρc). In the resonance tube located in front of the resonator, the acoustic ﬁeld can be described by the Riemann invariants deﬁned as f = 1 / 2(p ′ / (¯ρc) + u ′ ) and g = 1 / 2(p ′ / (¯ρc) − u ′ ) and depicted in Fig 1. In terms of these quantities, the impact of the Helmholtz resonator is determined by the reﬂection coefﬁcient R = g/f. The relation between this coefﬁcient R and the normalized impedance Z is given by Z = (1 + R)/ (1 − R). 3. Setup Several test cases are investigated both numerically and experimentally. These cases consist of combinations of three different neck proﬁles and two different backing volume lengths lcav in a res- onance tube with diameter dcav. The considered necks have the same length l 0 and diameter d 0 but differ in their edge proﬁles. One of the necks has a sharp edge ( lc = 0 ) where the other two have 45 ◦– chamfers with different sizes lc. The geometrical speciﬁcations are given in T ab. 1. The reﬂection behavior of these test cases is studied for various SPLs, in particular for 89.03, 115.06, and 119.07 d B. T able 1: Geometric properties (in mm).

The tube has six BSW A MP A 416 microphones with the average sensitivity of 50.045 m V/Pa. They are equally distributed along the 1-m long tube and the distances between two successive microphones are 175 mm. The microphones are relatively calibrated to carry out reﬂection coefﬁcient measurements from 100 Hz to 700 Hz. The inner diameter of the tube,dcav, is 50 mm. The data acquisition and signal processing is done by a combination of NI PCIe-6361 X-Series DAQ card and Lab View R⃝. One analogue output channel for the loudspeaker and six analogue input channels for microphones are used. The sampling rate for generated signal is 20 k Hz while it is 10 k Hz for recording. The closest microphone to the tube termination is selected as the reference input. The Lab View R⃝ script regulates the excitation amplitude of the loudspeaker for each frequency step. Doing so, it is possible to have the same – or very close – SPLs throughout the entire frequency span. It is important to note here that this reference microphone is placed 49.07 mm away from the tube termination. Accordingly, the SPLs are calculated at this position. The reference position would ideally be located at the resonator mouth, but due to physical constraints, placing a microphone at that position was not possible in this setup. Some precautions are taken to minimize the measurements errors. First, the recorded data from the microphones are processed using a lock-in method instead of using FFT. Secondly, the visco-thermal effects in the tube are included and implemented in the wave decomposition. Finally, instead 1 s = (1 + ( κ − 1)/ √ P r) √ 2ν/ω /d 0, where the variables P r, κ, and ν denote the Prandl number, the heat capacity ratio, and the kinematic viscosity, respectively.

With all these speciﬁcations and precautions, the deviation from the theoretical closed-end reﬂection coefﬁcient value is less than 0.05 % in the frequency of interest. 3.02 Numerical Setup The compressible Navier-Stokes equations with k-equation eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model are solved in 3 D using the Pimple algorithm of Open FOAM. The tolerance for stop criterion for outer iteration loops accounting for compressible pressure-velocity coupling are set low – i. e. accurate – enough to resolve the acoustic ﬁeld in details. Here, a threshold for the pressure residual of 10−5 was applied.The time step size ∆ t is adjusted such that the acoustic CFL number c ∆ t/ ∆ x is clearly below unity in the main parts. Only close to the walls, this number can be slightly larger, but the acoustic behavior is still resolved accurately in those regions due to implicit time integration. The geometrical dimensions of the neck conﬁgurations and of the backing volumes are set in analogy to the experimental setup properties summarized in T ab. 1. At the corresponding boundaries, the no-slip condition is utilized. The slip condition is used at the cylindrical wall of the impedance tube which does not belong to the resonator itself. For each geometry investigated, a structured o- grid mesh with at least 0.08 million cells is set up. Hereby especially, the boundary layer, whose thickness can a priori be estimated by the Stokes lengthδs = 2 π √ 2ν/ω, must be resolved well for the frequencies of interest. In the linear regime, grid independence studies and validation have proved the appropriateness of such a setting, see. At the distance lsim = 10 cm, the inlet patch is located, where the Navier-Stokes characteristics boundary condition (NSCBC), c. f. is applied. This boundary condition ensures a low acoustic reﬂection of the outgoingg wave. Simultaneously, an input signal can be imposed for the incoming f wave. At this inlet plane, the ﬂuctuating pressure p ′ and velocity u ′ are measured. From these quantities, the time series of the Riemann invariants f and g can be computed directly. For that purpose, the distance lsim is chosen large enough such that non-acoustic disturbances as the vortices present in the vicinity of the neck do not inﬂuence the measurement. The reﬂection coefﬁcient is estimated from the measured input f and output g time series. First, these time series are shifted with respect to each other to account for the time it takes to travel from the reference plane to the resonator and back. Then for the identiﬁcation, two approaches are applied depending of the present regime. In the linear regime corresponding to a low SPL as 89.03 d B, linear system identiﬁcation techniques are used. Here, the domain is excited with a well-designed broad- band signal. From the response, a second order Output-Error model is estimated, valid for the whole frequency range of interest. In the non-linear regime with higher amplitudes, harmonic simu- lations are performed with several angular frequenciesωm. For the determination of the numerical Rnum(ωm) = ﬀt( g)(ωm)/ ﬀt(f)(ωm), the signals are additionally truncated to get rid of the transient starting behavior and to have a signal length of a multiple of the period 1/ (2π ωm). The amplitude of the input signal f is calculated according to the the experimental data. 4. Results Gain and phase of the reﬂection coefﬁcient are presented for the SPLs investigated for all cases with lcav = 20 mm in Fig. 2. The reﬂection coefﬁcient is transformed to the normalized surface impedance Z, using the relation Z = (1+ R)/ (1−R) and plotted in Fig. 3. Due to lack of space, only the results for the backing volume with 20 mm length are shown in the present paper. The following discussions and ﬁndings are equally supported by the other cases with 10 mm backing volume length. For all geometries, experiment and simulation agree very well in the linear regime. The evaluation of the 89.03 d B simulations conﬁrms that the ﬂow does not separate at the edges. That means that the Stokes boundary layer is resolved sufﬁciently in the simulations to capture the thermo-viscous dissi- pation taking place in that region. In the non-linear regime, the agreement is only of qualitative, but 4 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 Reproduction of Papers The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration 200 300 400 500 600 7000 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 gain(R)[−] sharp edge 89.03 d B 115.03 d B 119.07 d B 200 300 400 500 600 700−8 −6 −4 −2 phase(R)[rad] f [Hz] 200 300 400 500 600 7000 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 chamfered (0.035 mm) 89.03 d B 115.03 d B 119.07 d B 200 300 400 500 600 700−8 −6 −4 −2 f [Hz] 200 300 400 500 600 7000 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 chamfered (1 mm) 89.03 d B 115.03 d B 119.07 d B 200 300 400 500 600 700−8 −6 −4 −2 f [Hz] Figure 2: Reﬂection coefﬁcient in gain and phase representation for all conﬁgurations with lcav = 20 mm. \"— • —\": measurement results; \"—\": linear SI results; and \" ◦\": harmonic simulation results.

The reactanceℑ(Z) curves still match for all cases and amplitudes in that regime. But, the non-linear resistance is systematically over-predicted by the numerical simulations for all cases. The reason for this over-prediction is topic of ongoing research. The grid dependency as well as the inﬂuence of the sub-grid scale modeling have to be studied in more detail. Another reason might be that the edges are perfectly sharp in the simulation, whereas they are not in reality. Never- theless, the simulations provide a detailed view on the ﬂow present in the resonator. The following statements are conﬁrmed by both experiment and simulation in the same manner. First, the inﬂuence of the edge geometry on the eigenfrequency is discussed. This is a linear effect and, thus, independent on the current SPL. Only for very high amplitudes beyond the SPL considered in this study, the eigenfrequency is nominally inﬂuenced by the amplitude, see for instance. The eigenfrequency can be detected by the minimal gain of the reﬂection coefﬁcient. The corresponding phase is either−π in the non-over-damped case or 0 in the over-damped case. Moreover, the reactance ℑ(Z) vanishes at the eigenfrequency. With these criteria, a shift of the eigenfrequency towards higher frequencies with increasing the chamfer size can be observed. In the speciﬁc case of 20 mm cavity length, the eigenfrequency rises from around 375 Hz without a chamfer, to approximately 385 Hz and 410 Hz with the 0.035 mm and 1 mm-chamfer, respectively. This shift can be explained by a reduction of the effective length with increasing the chamfer length. For the three cases, the resulting effective length are 7.019 mm, 6.082 mm, and 6.002 mm, respectively. The detected effective length of the unchamfered case go in line with the correlation by Ingard. He suggested for large aspect ratios (d 0/ 3√ V ≪ 1) an end correction of 8/ (3π)d 0, which would lead to an effective length of 7.056 mm. The observed reduction of the effective length with non-sharp edges has already been seen by other authors, see, e. g. In the analogy of the mass-spring-damper system discussed in Sec. 2, this means that less mass in the neck is taking in the oscillation with increasing the chamfer size. Moreover, a reduction of the non-linear resistance can be observed in the presence of a chamfer. As discussed in Sec. 2, the non-linear resistance results from the ﬂow separation the resonator edges. T wo velocity ﬁeld snapshots during the outﬂow for a sharp and a 1-mm-chamfered edge case with 119.07 d B excitation are presented in Fig. 4. In the sharp edge case visualized in Fig. 4(a), it can be observed that the ﬂow separates at both the inner and the outer edge. T wo large recirculation zones are temporally formed downstream of the respective edge. One of these zones is located in front of the resonator mouth and the other in the neck. Chamfering the sharp edges produces four obtuse edges that cause the ﬂow to separate with smaller recirculation zones; see Fig. 4(b). The observed contraction of the stream motivates a comparison with the quasi-static theory including the vena contracta effect. The vena contracta for large amplitudes for sharp edges is about 0.070 while it is 0.095 for chamfered edges. Since the non-linear losses scale approximately linear with the square of the jet velocity, the non-linear residence is inversely proportional to the square of the vena contracta factor. This explains the observed difference in the non-linear residence for high amplitudes by a factor of around two, see Fig. 3 and discussion below. 6 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 Reproduction of Papers The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration In the non-linear regime, increasing the amplitude always promotes the separation and, thus, leads to higher non-linear losses. This results in larger resistance values for higher excitation amplitudes in all cases, see Fig. 3. If the resonator is normally damped, the normalized acoustic resistanceℜ(Z) is below unity – the optimal resistance value for normal incident acoustic waves, i. e. ℜ(Z) < 1. In that case, the increase of the acoustic resistance leads to a lower gain of the reﬂection coefﬁcient, as it can be seen in the right columns of Figs. 2 and 3. This lower gain means that a higher proportion of the acoustic energy is dissipated. The situation changes in the over-damped case whereℜ(Z) > 1 (c. f. left column in Figs. 2 and 3): Here, the additional non-linear resistance leads to a decrease in absorption. The normal and over-damped cases can also be distinguished by the examination the phase curve of the reﬂection coefﬁcient̸ R. These phase angles differ from each other close to the eigenfrequency. In the over-damped case, it is 0 whereas it is −π in the normal damped case. In both cases, the waves f and g are in phase – i. e. ̸ R = 0 mod 2 π – away from the eigenfrequency. With the 1 mm-chamfer, none of the investigated SPLs lead to an over-damped behavior, whereas both non-linear cases are in the over-damped region for the sharp edge geometry. Notice that not only the non-linear but also the linear resistance varies with the edge proﬁle. For instance, linear resistance decreases by 11% and 22% for the cases of 0.035 mm and 1.00 mm–chamfers, respectively. This shows that increasing the chamfer size reduces the thermo-viscous effect around the neck. Y et the impact on the resistance becomes more striking in the non-linear regime caused by a reduction of shedding. With the 0.035 mm-chamfer, the non-linear resistance is reduced by approximately 47 % and 55 % for the 115.03 d B and 119.07 d B case, respectively. A reduction of 57 % and 70 % is measured with the 1 mm-chamfer. The stated values correspond to experimental data. The magnitudes are similar for the simulation. Mainly, the presence of a chamfer reduces the non-linear losses signiﬁcantly. The actual length of the chamfer also inﬂuences this reduction but in a minor manner. Moreover, it can be be observed that the relative reduction is larger for higher SPL. This ﬁts well to the above discussed ﬂow properties: the strong separation with its large recirculation zones causes the high non-linear acoustic absorption in the sharp edge case. Much less energy is taken from the acoustics by the four separation areas with little recirculation in the chamfered case. The separation process itself is mainly determined by the sharpness of the edge. 5. Conclusion and Outlook The inﬂuence of the edge shape of a Helmholtz resonator has been investigated by means of both experiments and LES simulations. T o study this inﬂuence, various combinations of necks with different chamfer sizes and backing volumes have been considered. By variation of the SPL, the linear regime, where thermo-viscous losses are dominant, as well as the non-linear regime, where vortex shedding leads to additional losses, have been included. In the linear regime, the results obtained from both methods match very well. The results agree qualitatively in the non-linear regime as well, even though the absolute values slightly disagree. The simulations overpredict the non-linear resistance. The reason for this disagreement is topic of ongoing research. Nevertheless, the following statements are supported equally by both the experimental and numerical investigations. By increasing the chamfer size, a shift towards higher eigenfrequency frequencies has been ob- served. This shift occurs due to the fact that the oscillating mass in the neck is reduced, i. e. the effective length is shortened. This reduction is in good agreement with other correlation available in the literature. Another important observation is that a chamfered edge proﬁle reduces the vortex shedding in the resonator neck signiﬁcantly. Depending on the SPL, the chamfered edge proﬁle reduces the non- linear resistance about the half of its value compared to the sharp edge case. This reduction is mainly due to presence of the chamfer, but depends only weakly on its length. T o the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that this effect has been quantiﬁed for the Helmholtz resonator.

Polifke§ Technische Universität München, 85748 Garching, Germany DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055295 The nonlinear response of acoustic resonators is investigated over a broad range of frequencies and amplitudes. Helmholtz resonators with a symmetric neck and an asymmetric neck, respectively, as well as quarter-wave resonators are considered. Describing functions for impedance and the reflection coefficient of a Helmholtz resonator at various sound pressure levels are determined from compressible flow simulation and validated against experimental data. The particular focus of the present study is the nonlinear scattering to higher harmonics. For the Helmholtz resonator with a symmetric neck, a distinct pattern in the amplitudes of the higher harmonics is observed, where the odd harmonics dominate the response, whereas the even harmonics are almost negligible. Such an“odd- harmonics-only” pattern, which was observed previously in an experiment at the orifices, is explained by a quasi- steady analysis based on the Bernoulli equation, assuming a symmetric flow pattern at the neck. For the Helmholtz resonator with an asymmetric neck, it is observed in computational fluid dynamics simulations that even harmonics contribute noticeably to the resonator response, such that the odd-harmonics-only pattern is less pronounced. For the markedly asymmetric geometry of the quarter-wave resonator, the second harmonic is dominant and the odd- harmonics-only pattern vanishes completely. The quasi-steady analysis is extended successfully to also describe nonlinear scattering to higher harmonics for asymmetric configurations and flow patterns. Overall, the scattering to higher harmonics remains on a moderate level, even at very high excitation levels for the Helmholtz resonator configurations. For the quarter-wave resonator, the scattering is more pronounced and contributes perceptibly to the response at high excitation amplitudes.

Introduction A COUSTIC resonators are used in various industrial applications to reduce sound emission or to avoid thermoacoustic instabilities. Two basic types of such resonators are the Helmholtz and the quarter-wave resonators, which are sketched in Fig. 1. The scattering behavior of such resonators is investigated in this study under ambient conditions without mean flow. During operation in industrial applications, the scattering behavior of resonators can be strongly influenced by the working conditions.

In most applications, a grazing flow over the resonators is present. This can cause a shift in the resonator eigenfrequency and has an impact on the resistance. This has been studied, e.g. experimentally by Jones et al and numerically by Zhang and Bodony. Especially in gas turbines, resonators are often purged to guard them from the hot gas in the combustion chamber and to guarantee constant working conditions. Moreover, this increases the acoustic losses significantly; see, for instance, the work of Eldredge and Dowling, Bellucci et al, or Scarpato et al. When the amplitude of the acoustic excitation rises and the purging flow rate is too low, hot gas can penetrate the resonator opening. This can detune the resonator and should thus be avoided; see, e.g. the studies byĆosić et al and Rupp et al. The present study will be based on two approaches: computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and one-dimensional (1-D) quasi-steady analysis. CFD simulations were performed by Tam et al [12–14]. In a series of papers [12–14], they studied slit and Helmholtz resonators using direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques: first, in a two- dimensional (2-D) setup; and later, in a 3-D configuration. The DNS approach was also pursued by Zhang and Bodony, who studied the influence of laminar and turbulent grazing flows and the interaction between neighboring cavity openings. Mendez and Eldredge determined the influence of purging flow via large- eddy simulations (LESs). The LES approach is also followed in the present study. Moreover, the linearized Navier–Stokes equations can be used to investigate the linear response of a resonator, as was done by Tournadre et al for the investigation of temperature effects. An alternative approach to those explicitly solving the Navier–Stokes equations is the Lattice Boltzmann method, which is based on particle collision models and promises a low numerical cost; see, for instance, the work of Ji and Zhao. Another alternative is to characterize an orifice (corresponding to the resonator neck) by incompressible simulations and add the contribution of the compressible backing volume analytically. On the side of the analytical modeling of Helmholtz resonators, a 1-D semiempirical quasi-steady approach is followed in the present study, as is often done in the literature. The idea of this ansatz is to analyze the Helmholtz resonator decomposed in an acoustically compact orifice and a compressible backing volume. The motion of the fluid in the neck can then be described by a 1-D quasi-steady equation containing semiempirical correlations; see the studies by Ingard, Ingard and Ising, Melling, Cummings, Hersh et al, as well as Singh and Rienstra. Physically, resonators dissipate acoustic energy due to the thermoviscous losses at the walls. It is well known that, for sufficiently high excitation amplitudes, additional acoustic energy is absorbed due to flow separation at the resonator edges. Flow separation processes are very sensitive to the edge shape. The edge shape impact was investigated for open-end pipes by Disselhorst and Wijngaarden, as well as Atig et al. Temiz et al investigated this effect for orifice configurations. Its influence on the resonator impedance was evaluated by Laudien et al and Förner et al. The acoustic dissipation by flow separation is a nonlinear phenomena. Its nonlinear behavior can be detected by two aspects for a harmonic excitation: On the one hand, the amplitude and phase of the reflected wave at the frequency of excitation may depend on the amplitude of the excitation. This behavior can be described in terms of describing functions for the resonator impedance or its reflection coefficient; see, for instance, the work of Hersh et al and Singh and Rienstra, or the Appendix of the present paper. On the other hand, scattering of acoustic energy to other frequencies may occur. To the authors’knowledge, this has not yet been studied in detail for resonators. The scattering to higher harmonics at an orifice, which is closely related to the Helmholtz resonator, was studied experimentally and analytically by Ingard and Ising as well as Cummings. An odd-harmonics-only (OHO) pattern in the higher harmonics was observed, where only the odd harmonics are present in the response. This observation could be explained by a quasi-steady analysis based on the Bernoulli equation. The present study investigates the nonlinear acoustic scattering of both Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonator designs by means of CFD simulations. The appearance of the OHO pattern is found to depend on the symmetry of the configuration under study. The quasi- steady theory for scattering to higher harmonics at symmetric orifices is extended to also describe asymmetric configurations and flow conditions, such that it can be applied to Helmholtz resonators with an asymmetric neck or quarter-wave resonators. The paper is organized as follows: The approaches to describe the resonator response restricted to the fundamental frequency are presented in Sec. II. The quasi-steady theory from the literature is also introduced in this section. In Sec. III, this theory is applied and extended for the considered cases and the scattering behavior is evaluated. Section IV presents the scattering behavior observed in the CFD simulations for both the Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators. The behavior is also compared to analytical prediction. Finally, the findings are summarized in Sec. V. II. Physical Background In this section, the basic terminology to characterize acoustic resonators is introduced. Moreover, a quasi-steady analysis based on the incompressible Bernoulli equation is presented, which accounts for nonlinearities of the pressure drop across the neck of a resonator. Throughout the whole study, the geometrical quantities, shown in Fig. 1, are denoted as follows: For the Helmholtz resonators, the lengths and diameters of the neck and of the backing volume are referred to asl 0, d 0, lcav, and dcav, respectively. The length and diameter of the quarter-wave resonator are named asl 0 and d 0. The open area ratio is denoted byσ. A. Impedance and Reflection Coefficient Describing Functions The behavior of an acoustic resonator is often described in the frequency domain by its impedance Z. It is defined as the ratio of the Fourier transforms (^·) of the fluctuating acoustic pressurep 0 and velocity u 0 normal to the reference surface: Z/.0133ω0/.0134/.0136 z/.0133ω/.0134 c 0ρ0 /.0136 ^p/.0133ω0/.0134 ^u/.0133ω0/.0134 (1) a) Helmholtz resonator b) Quarter-wave resonator Fig. 1 Sketch of both resonator types considered.

Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on December 9, 2016 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055295 Reproduction of Papers Here, ω0 denotes the angular excitation frequency. The real part of the impedance is referred to as resistance and its imaginary part as reactance. In the following, impedance values normalized with the air specific impedanceρ0 c 0 are denoted by lowercasez. Here,ρ0 and c 0 stand for the mean density and the speed of sound, respectively. The resonator can also be characterized in terms of characteristic wave amplitudes f and g, assuming 1-D acoustics in front of the resonator. Thesef and g quantities can be considered as right- and left-traveling waves, respectively. In the absence of mean flow, they are defined asf /.0136/.0133 p 0∕/.0133ρ0 c 0/.0134/.0135 u 0/.0134∕2 and g /.0136/.0133 p 0∕/.0133ρ0 c 0/.0134 −u 0/.0134∕2. The ratio of the reflected ^g/.0133ω0/.0134 wave to the normally incident ^f/.0133ω0/.0134 wave in the frequency domain is defined as the reflection coefficient R/.0133ω0/.0134/.0136 ^g/.0133ω0/.0134∕ ^f/.0133ω0/.0134. Its relation to the impedance is given by the following: R/.0133ω0/.0134/.0136 ^g/.0133ω0/.0134 ^f/.0133ω0/.0134 /.0136 Z/.0133ω0/.0134 − ρ0 c 0 Z/.0133ω0/.0134/.0135 ρ0 c 0 /.0136 z/.0133ω0/.0134 − 1 z/.0133ω0/.0134/.0135 1 (2) At the resonator angular eigenfrequency ωeig, the reactance vanishes I/.0133 Z/.0133ωeig/.0134/.0134 /.0136 0 and, accordingly, the optimal resistance equals the specific impedance ρ0 c 0 of the medium, where no reflection takes place at all (i.e.j R/.0133ωeig/.0134 j /.0136 0). Thus, the gain of the reflection coefficient decreases with the increasing sound pressure level (SPL) until it reaches the optimal resistance R/.0133 z/.0133ωeig/.0134/.0134 /.0136 1. For a resistance larger than this optimal value R/.0133 z/.0133ωeig/.0134/.0134 > 1, the resonator is called overdamped. In that case, the reflection coefficient grows with a further increase of the resistance, as can be also observed in Sec. IV. The concepts introduced previously are not adequate to characterize nonlinear phenomena because Z and R do not depend on the excitation amplitude. To extend the impedance to the nonlinear regime, the describing function approach is commonly used; see, for instance, the work of Hersh et al, which is referred to as th eimpedance describing function in the following. Here, the impedance is specified, not only in dependency on the frequency but also on the excitation amplitude. This is commonly done in terms of the sound pressure level present at a certain reference position. The value of this SPL is defined as 20 log 10/.0133 prms∕pref /.0134, whereprms and pref denote the root mean square of the fluctuating pressure and the reference pressure in air of 20 μPa, respectively. Note that this approach cannot represent the nonlinear behavior in a comprehensive manner but only the behavior for the fundamental frequency of excitation. In particular, the scattering to higher harmonics is not included in this describing approach, which is investigated in the current paper. B. Flow Separation as the Cause of Nonlinear Behavior The Helmholtz resonator can be analyzed as a combination of an acoustically compact orifice and a backing volume in the linear and nonlinear regimes. Thus, the loss mechanisms for a Helmholtz resonator are the same as those at an orifice. To understand those mechanisms, the 1-D unsteady Bernoulli equation with suitable extensions for the loss terms can be studied for an orifice, as sketched in Fig. 2 a; see, e.g. In the quarter-wave resonator case, the situation is different due to the asymmetry of the area jump, as sketched in Fig. 2 b, but it can be analyzed in a similar framework. The following discussion helps to understand how the nonlinear losses are caused in both configurations. The analysis is presented in nondimensional form. Nondimen- sional quantities are indicated by the superscript∼. The reference time tc and pressure pc used for the nondimensionalization are defined as follows: tc /.0136 lc c 0 and pc /.0136 ρ0 c 2 0 (3) The reference length scalelc, which was already introduced to define the timescaletc, is set differently for the orifice and the area jump to account for the different typical scales present. It is set such that the corresponding nondimensional angular eigenfrequencies ~ωeig /.0136 ωeigtc for the Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators are unity, i.e. ~ωeig /.0136 ωeigtc /.0136 1. These eigenfrequencies ofωHR eigand ωQW eigcan be approximated as Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators ωHR eig/.0136 c 0 /.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 σ lcav/.0133 l 0 /.0135 2Δl/.0134 r and ωQW eig/.0136 πc 0 2/.0133 l 0 /.0135 Δl/.0134 (4) respectively. The length correctionΔl accounts for fluid in front of the resonator opening taking part in the oscillation and can be set according to Ingard as 4∕/.01333π/.0134 d 0, whered 0 is the diameter of the opening. This geometrical lengthl 0 and the length corrections (2Δl and Δl, respectively) are usually combined to the so-called effective lengths le, as described in more detail in Eq. (7). The corresponding length scales are set as follows: l HR c/.0136 /.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129/.0129 lcav/.0133 l 0 /.0135 2Δl/.0134 σ r and l QW c/.0136 2/.0133 l 0 /.0135 Δl/.0134 π (5) At first, the Helmholtz resonator is considered. It is assumed here that the resonator neck is acoustically compact such that it can be treated as an incompressible orifice. Viscous losses are neglected at the beginning of this consideration, and the Bernoulli equation is studied. This equation reads in terms of fluctuating quantities in nondimensional form as follows: ∂~ϕ0 ∂~t /.0135 1 2~u 02 /.0135 ~p 0 /.0136 const: (6) where ~ϕ is the nondimensionalized potential~u /.0136 ~∇ ~ϕ. The preceding equation is integrated from positions 1 to 2, sketched in Fig. 2 a. The nondimensionalized effective length~le is introduced to express the result in a compact form:b) Area jump (with flow-dependent contraction)a) Orifice Fig. 2 Sketch of the corresponding geometries for the incompressible quasi-steady analysis.

The~x-dependent area formed by the flowpath is~A/.0133 ~x/.0134. Note that the effective length equals the nondimensionalized geometrical length of the orifice~l 0 with an additional, nondimensionalized end correction 2Δ~l added; see, e.g. Ingard. The pressure drop Δ ~p 0 /.0136 ~p 0 1 − ~p 0 2 over the orifice without losses can be expressed as follows: Δ ~p 0 ≈ 1 σ ~le ∂ ~u 0 ∂~t (8) The losses caused by friction at the orifice walls, which are not considered in the preceding equation, can be included by an appropriate real-valued constant~Rl (see, e.g. the work of Boden and Zhou ). When the acoustical partial displacement in the orifice reaches the same order as the orifice diameter~d 0 or is larger (i.e. when the Strouhal number Sr /.0136 ~ω ~d 0σ∕j ~uj is small), the flow cannot follow the edge contour anymore and separates. Thus, the flow takes less area to jet through the orifice, as sketched in Fig. 2 a. The ratio of the flow core area to the geometrical cross-sectional area is described by the contraction factor Cd, which is also often referred to as the discharge coefficient. In the linear regime where Sr ≫ 1,i t can be assumed the Cd ≈ 1, whereas Cd < 1 in the nonlinear regime. Besides the Strouhal number, the edge shape also has a strong impact on the separation process. The sharper the edge, the more pronounced the separation. Using the contraction factor, the velocity in the orifice can be expressed as~u 0 0 /.0136 1∕/.0133 Cdσ/.0134 ~u 0. When such a jet forms, it takes energy from the acoustics, which is dissipated in the vortex structures generated due to the separation. If it is assumed that the kinetic energy of the flow in the orifice 1∕2/.01331∕/.0133 Cdσ/.0134 ~u 0/.01342 is fully dissipated and does not recuperate downstream of the orifice (see, for instance, the work of Ingard ), it follows that Δ ~p 0 ≈ σ ~le ∂ ~u 0 ∂~t|/.0130/.0130{z/.0130/.0130} inertia /.0135 ~Rl ~u 0 |{z} viscosity /.0135 1 ~u 0 j ~u 0 j /.0133 Cdσ/.01342 |/.0130/.0130/.0130{z/.0130/.0130/.0130} flow separation (9) It can be seen in the preceding expression that the loss terms due to friction and flow separation contribute to the resistive part. When the losses and the pressure drop are not in equilibrium, the fluid in the orifice is accelerated, which solely impacts the reactance of the transfer impedance (d∂ ~u 0∕∂~t /.0136 i ~ω ^~u). Moreover, it can be seen that only the flow separation behaves in a nonlinear fashion in this model. In analogy, an acoustically compact area jump, as sketched in Fig. 2 b, can be considered for the investigation of a quarter-wave resonator. In comparison to the formulations for the orifice found in the literature, an additional term is introduced that also behaves nonlinearly. By integration of the Bernoulli equation [Eq. (6)], the additional term 1∕2 ~u 02/.01331∕σ2 − 1/.0134 appears due the nonequal cross-section area on both sides. In this case, the pressure drop can be expressed as follows: Δ ~p 0 ≈ σ ~l AJ e ∂ ~u 0 ∂~t /.0135 1 2~u 02 /.0018 σ2 − 1 /.0019 /.0135 ~RAJ l~u 0 /.0135 ~u 0 j ~u 0 j /.0133 Cdσ/.01342 (10) In the preceding,~l AJ eand ~RAJ ldenote a suitable nondimensionalized effective length and linear loss term for the area jump, respectively. III. Scattering to Higher Harmonics Described by Quasi-Steady 1-D Analysis In contrast to linear systems, nonlinear systems can respond not only at the fundamental angular frequencyω0 of the excitation but also at its multiples: the so-called higher harmonics. The fundamental frequencyω0 is referred to as the first harmonic, and any multiples nω0 are referred to as thenth harmonic (n ∈ N). In the following, the spectrum of the response is studied numerically in dependency on the excitation frequency and amplitude. To the authors’knowledge, this is studied for the first time in detail for resonator configurations. The orifice, which is from a geometrical point of view close to the Helmholtz resonator, is investigated experimentally and analytically with respect to its scattering behavior; see, e.g. the work of Ingard and Ising and Cummings. A pattern in the harmonics is observed in those studies, where the odd harmonics (third, fifth,::: ) dominate clearly over the even ones (second, fourth,::: ). This pattern is referred to as odd-harmonics only in the following. Ingard and Cummings explained the appearance of the OHO pattern by studying quasi-steady 1-D equations. In the following, these considerations are extended step by step to also account for an asymmetric orifice and for an area jump, as they are present for a Helmholtz resonator with an asymmetric neck and a quarter-wave resonator. This analysis is applied to predict the relative contributions of the first five harmonics for Helmholtz resonators with symmetric and asymmetric necks, as well as quarter-wave resonators. The appearance or absence of the OHO pattern can be explained by studying quasi-steady 1-D equations, such as Eqs. (9) and (10). Similar considerations were made by Ingard and Cummings. The theory presented in the literature is restricted to orifices assuming a time-invariant contraction factor Cd for the whole cycle. In the current study, the contraction coefficient Cd is assumed to be constant during the inflow and outflow half-cycles: Cd /.0136 /.0026 C/.0135 d; for ~u 0 ≥ 0 C− d; for ~u 0 < 0 (11) First, the orifice is considered where the pressure drop is described by Eq. (9). The only nonlinear term is given as 1∕/.01372/.0133 Cdσ/.01342/.0138 ~u 0 j ~u 0 j. Accordingly, this is the only term that can contribute to the scattering to higher harmonics. Thus, the other terms are disregarded in the analysis because the focus of the study is the scattering behavior to higher harmonics, i.e. Δ ~p 0/.0133 ~t/.01342σ2 /.0136 C 2 d ~u 0 j ~u 0 j (12) If a sinusoidal velocity ~u 0/.0133 ~t/.0134/.0136 ~Au sin/.0133 ~ω0 ~t/.0134 is assumed, the Fourier series of this pressure drop reads as Δ ~p 0/.0133 ~t/.0134 2σ2 ~A 2 u /.0136 a 0 2 /.0135 X∞ n/.0136 1 an cos/.0133 n ~ω0 ~t/.0134/.0135 bn sin/.0133 n ~ω0 ~t/.0134 (13) with the constants an /.0136 > > < > > : 2/.0133 C/.0135 d − C− d/.0134; for n /.0136 0 4/.0133 C− d− C/.0135 d/.0134; for n /.0136 2 0; else (14) and bn /.0136 /.0026 −4/.0133 C− d/.0135 C/.0135 d/.0134 π/.0133 n 3−4 n/.0134; for oddn 0; else (15) It can be seen that, for symmetric flow conditions with C/.0135 d /.0136 C− d, the coefficients an /.0136 0 for all n. Thus, only contributions with bn ≠ 0 remain for oddn. It can be concluded that the appearance of the OHO pattern is due to the symmetry of the flow. This flow symmetry is broken for an asymmetric geometry. Note also that the mean flow may lead to different flow contraction conditions during the inflow and outflow phases, as shown by Zhang and Bodony for a Helmholtz resonator with grazing flow. The flow asymmetry due to flow separation at sufficiently high amplitudes can be described like this for a one-sided chamfered orifice: At the sharp orifice edge, the flow contracts (i.e.C/.0135 d < 1), whereas it does not at the chamfered edge (i.e.C− d≈ 1). 4 Article in Advance / FÖRNER ET AL. Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on December 9, 2016 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055295 Reproduction of Papers The asymmetry increases when the area jump is studied instead of the orifice. The separation term [Eq. (12)] analyzed by Fourier transform in Eqs. (13–15) is also part of the nonlinear response. Due to the change in cross section at the area jump, an additional term appears in Eq. (10). This term can be expressed as follows: ~A 2 usin 2/.0133 ~ω0 ~t/.0134 /.0018 σ2 − 1 /.0019 /.0136 1 ~A 2 u /.0018 σ2 − 1 /.0019 /.01331 − sin/.01332 ~ω0 ~t/.0134/.0134 (16) The preceding expression contributes significantly to the second harmonic, and thus amplifies the disappearance of the OHO pattern. The following conclusions can be made from the preceding considerations: The Helmholtz resonator with a symmetric neck shows the OHO pattern, where the harmonics decrease with increasing order. If its neck is asymmetric (e.g. with C/.0135 d ≈ 0.07 for a sharp edge and C− d≈ 0.095 for a 45 deg chamfered edge; see ), the OHO pattern gets weaker. The third harmonic is still dominant. But now, the second harmonic is predicted to be more pronounced than the fifth one. When a quarter-wave resonator is considered, strong scattering in the second harmonic is expected. Overall, the scattering to higher harmonics is much larger here than in the case of a Helmholtz resonator (forσ ≪ 1). In the preceding discussion, only the nonlinear terms are considered. It can be seen in Eqs. (13) and (16) that their contribution scales with the square of the amplitude of the velocity~A 2 u, whereas all the other linear terms scale with the amplitude of the velocity~Au. Thus, it can be concluded that the impact of the nonlinear term responsible for the scattering to higher harmonics rises with increasing velocity. IV. Scattering to Higher Harmonics Observed in CFD Simulations In this section, the predicted patterns in the amplitudes of the higher harmonics are verified and quantified with compressible CFD simulations for three resonator configurations. These considered configurations as well as the computational setup are introduced in Sec. IV.A. A qualitative comparison of compressible Helmholtz resonator simulations and incompressible orifice simulations is performed in Sec. IV.B. By doing so, a link from the incompressible theory to compressible resonator simulations is provided. Moreover, the flow separation for the three test cases is investigated during the inflow and outflow phases in this section. Finally, the results of the compressible simulations of three resonators are presented and discussed in Sec. IV.C. A. Simulation Setup and Definition of the Test Cases 1. Definition of Test Cases In the present numerical study, a quarter-wave (QW) resonator as well as Helmholtz resonators with symmetric (HRS) and asymmetric (HRA) necks are considered. The generic geometries are sketched in Fig. 1. The neck of configuration HRA is chamfered by 45 deg on the outside, with a length in the axial direction oflch /.0136 0.035 mm. The values of all geometric quantities are listed in Table 1 in dimensional and nondimensional forms. The HRS configuration is set as in to have access to validation data. The chamfer length is set small enough that it influences the linear response of the resonator only marginally. 2. CFD Solver Setup Compressible CFD simulations are performed with the PIMPLE algorithm of Open FOAM. The slip condition is applied at the cylindrical wall of the impedance tube and the no-slip condition is used at the resonator itself; see Fig. 1. At the inlet, the Navier–Stokes characteristics boundary condition (cf. Poinsot and Lele ) is used. This boundary condition ensures a low acoustic reflection of the outgoingg wave. Simultaneously, an excitation signal can be imposed for the incoming f wave, which is set sinusoidally [f /.0136 Af sin/.0133ω0 t/.0134] with different fundamental frequencies:ω0∕/.01332π/.0134. At this inlet plane, the fluctuating pressurep 0 and velocity u 0 are monitored. From these dimensional quantities, the time series of the nondimensional~f and ~g waves can be computed directly. As explained previously, the incoming wave scatters in the harmonics of the reflected wave^~g/.0133 n ~ω0/.0134. In the following figures, the amplitudes of the higher harmonics^~g/.0133 n ~ω0/.0134 are normalized by the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the incoming wave^~f/.0133 ~ω0/.0134, which can be written as follows: /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 ^~g/.0133 n ~ω0/.0134 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 ^~f/.0133 ~ω0/.0134 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 (17) In the postprocessing, the transient parts of the data series have been removed and then truncated to a multiple of the period T to avoid leakage in the spectra. For further details on the solver, refer to. The simulations use three-dimensional (3-D) meshes of at least 1.05 million cells. Note that this is, overall, a rather coarse mesh in comparison to DNSs available in the literature. However, the mesh is refined carefully in the Helmholtz resonator neck (and the quarter-wave resonator mouth, respectively), and especially at the edges because, here, the mechanisms responsible for the acoustic dissipation take place. The mesh independence with respect to the acoustic impedance is checked for HRS up to an overall SPL of 125 d B. Overall, reasonable results with relatively low computation cost can be achieved, enabling for extensive parameter studies. The compressible CFD simulations are performed as LESs with the k-equation eddy-viscosity model as a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. Several SGS models have been tested. However, the acoustic response of the resonator depends only very weakly on the SGS modeling. V ortex structures are formed in the vicinity of the resonator neck due to the pulsation forcing of the flow. The dissipation to thermal energy of these vortices follows mainly the turbulent cascade. However, the separation process itself, responsible for the nonlinear acoustic dissipation, is almost not influenced by the vortices. This can also be seen with the Reynolds number based on the orifice size and velocity amplitude at the orifice, which remains rather low (maximum Re≈3000 at 119.07 d B for HRS). Accordingly, the impact of the SGS model on acoustic properties remains very small as the separation process at the edges is resolved sufficiently. Moreover, comprehensive parameter studies regarding mesh, time- step, and solver parameters are performed to ensure that the presented results are independent of the numerical settings. The solver is validated in detail in the linear regime for various configurations in. In the nonlinear regime, the solver is validated against the measurements of M. A. Temiz¶ based on describing functions for the HRS configuration; see the Appendix. To compare the simulation with the measurement, the input amplitude Af of thef waves must be set such that the superposition of the wavesf and the reflectedg /.0136 Rf matches the desired SPL; see for more details. This requires an a priori knowledge of the reflection coefficient or an iterative process. In the following, this approach of setting the input amplitude is solely used for validation Table 1 Geometric properties of the considered Helmholtz and quarter-wave resonators in dimensional and nondimensional forms l 0,m m d 0,m m lcav,m m dcav,m m lch,m m σ,% ωeig∕/.01332π/.0134,H z ~l 0 ~d 0 ~lcav ~dcav ~lch ~ωeig HRS 4.00 4.02 20 50 0 0.071 373 0.00274 0.00288 0.01369 0.03423 0 1 HRA 4.00 4.02 20 50 0.035 0.071 373 0.00274 0.00288 0.01369 0.03423 0.00024 1 QW 143 6.035—— —— —— 1.056 589 1.05561 0.00691 —— —— —— 1 ¶Private communication by M.

Besides that, the SPL is set only with respect to the input signalf ignoring the reflected acousticg wave. This is referred to as input SPL in the following. Note that the input SPL and the actual SPL differ from each other. For the orifice configuration, incompressible simulations are also performed with the SIMPLE algorithm of the commercial software ANSYS Fluent v 15. A detailed description of the corresponding solver setting can be found in. For a given geometry and excitation frequency, the nonlinear behavior is linked to the magnitude of the velocity in the orifice and resonator neck, respectively. For a valid comparison, the input amplitude in the incompressible simulation has to be set such that velocities in the orifice agree with the velocities in the Helmholtz resonator neck. B. Validation of Modeling Assumptions via CFD 1. Linking the Incompressible and Compressible Approaches The orifice is treated as incompressible in the analysis of Sec. III, whereas the CFD simulations of the Helmholtz resonator are set up compressibly. Accordingly, a quantitative comparison between those two is not directly possible. Therefore, incompressible orifice CFD simulations are also considered in this section, which allow a link from the CFD simulations to the 1-D quasi-steady theory. The compressible resonator simulations and the incompressible orifice simulations can be compared qualitatively. A sinusoidal velocity ~u 0/.0133 ~t/.0134/.0136 ~Au sin/.0133 ~ω0 ~t/.0134 is assumed in the analysis of Sec. III. The higher harmonics occur there solely in the pressure dropΔ^~p/.0133 n ~ω0/.0134 over the orifice. This pressure drop including the higher harmonics is also determined via incompressible CFD simulations with sinusoidal velocity excitation. For these incompressible simulations, the orifice corresponding to the resonator neck of HRS is considered as geometry. The amplitudes Au of the velocities in the incompressible simulations are adjusted such that they coincide with the velocity amplitudes in the resonator neck present for a SPL of 119.07 d B at the reference distance of lref /.0136 49.07 mm. The higher harmonics in the pressure drop are presented in Fig. 3 a. In this figure, the amplitude of thenth harmonic is normalized by the fundamental harmonicΔ^~p/.0133 ~ω0/.0134, such that this harmonic is represented as /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 Δ^~p/.0133 n ~ω0/.0134 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 Δ^~p/.0133 ~ω0/.0134 /.0012 /.0012 /.0012 (18) Moreover, the results of 1-D simulations of the quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)] are included in this figure. It can be observed that both the 1-D quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)] and the incompressible CFD simulation exhibit the OHO predicted by the quasi-steady analysis. The third harmonic is dominant, followed by the fifth harmonics, as predicted by the analysis. The magnitude of the odd harmonics obtained by the 1-D simulations of the quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)] agrees well with the one of the CFD simulations. The scattering to higher harmonics takes place mainly close to the angular eigenfrequency~ωeig ≈ 1, where the velocities in the orifice are largest. In Fig. 3 b, the higher harmonics in the scatteredg wave [as defined in Eq. (17)] are plotted for the compressible LESs of the symmetric Helmholtz resonator. Again, the input amplitudes Af are set in a way that a SPL of 119.07 d B at the reference distancelref /.0136 49.07 mm is achieved. The 1-D quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)] can be rewritten in terms of Riemann invariantsf and g to a 1-D ordinary differential equation (ODE), which can be solved numerically. The scattered higher harmonics described by this 1-D quasi-steady ODE are also included in this figure. Both compressible approaches, the LES and the 1-D ODE, have the OHO pattern as predicted by the 1-D quasi- steady analysis in Sec. III. There are almost no contributions to the even harmonics for both compressible approaches. Also here, the scattering to higher harmonics occurs mainly close to the angular eigenfrequency~ω0 ≈ 1. This also agrees with the incompressible analysis because the velocities in the resonator neck are largest close to the eigenfrequency. It can be observed that the third harmonics of this quasi-steady 1-D approach agree very well these of the 3-D LESs. The fifth harmonic is underpredicted by the 1-D approach. Overall, the nonlinear term in the quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)], once written in terms of Riemann invariants, describes the mechanisms responsible for the scattering to higher harmonics accurately. It can be summarized that the OHO pattern is present for both symmetric orifices and Helmholtz resonators. For both configura- tions, the mechanism responsible for the scattering to higher harmonics can be explained well by studying the 1-D quasi-steady equation [Eq. (9)] as it is done in Sec. III. 2. Contraction Behavior for the Three Considered Configurations Before the scattering to higher harmonics in the compressible CFD simulations for each resonator is discussed, the flow contraction is investigated for these configurations. In Fig. 4, a snapshot of the flowfield during the inflow and outflow phases with maximal contraction is presented for all configurations. These snapshots are cropped to the vicinity of the resonator neck and mouth, respectively. Note that the separation process is a transient process such that, for a precise prediction, phase averaging over several periods and (subsequently) averaging over time would be required, as was done by Zhang and Bodony. Here, only the order of magnitude and the influence of the edge on separation behavior are evaluated optically with the presented snapshots. The separation zones are marked with thick lines at the upper edges in each figure. The resonators are excited at a frequency close to their eigenfrequencies~ω0 ≈ 1 (corresponding to 380 Hz) with an input SPL of 125 d B (for HRS and HRA) and at~ω0 ≈ 1 (corresponding to 580 Hz) with 160 d B (for QW). Configuration QW is excited with a higher SPL in comparison to the Helmholtz resonator configurations because it requires a higher SPL to trigger nonlinear a) Higher harmonics in Δ p at the oriﬁce [cf. Eq. (18)] b) Higher harmonics in f for the Helmholtz resonator [cf. Eq. (17)] Fig. 3 Higher harmonics for the Helmholtz resonator HRS and the corresponding orifice at 119.07 d B: second harmonic in CFD simulations, third, forth, fifth; harmonics with quasi-steady 1-D analysis are plotted with dotted lines (rel. relative). 6 Article in Advance / FÖRNER ET AL. Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on December 9, 2016 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055295 Reproduction of Papers behavior, as will be shown in Sec. IV.C.3. As explained previously, these SPL values are set here and in the following as input SPLs, which means that the SPL values refer solely to the inputf waves while ignoring the reflectedg waves. The separation behavior is similar for the inflow and outflow for HRS; see Figs. 4 a and 4 b. A contraction ratio of≈0.07, as can be found in the literature, is confirmed by the simulation. The asymmetric neck induces an asymmetric separation behavior. During the outflow, the contraction remains the same as for HRS; see Fig. 4 d. However, the flow contracts less with a factor of C/.0135 d ≈ 0.09 for the inflow (Fig. 4 c), which is close to the literature values (0.095 in Blevins’s textbook ). The separation is also asymmetric for the quarter- wave resonator with C/.0135 d ≈ 0.07 and C− d≈ 1, as can be seen in Figs. 4 e and 4 f. Overall, it can be concluded that the assumption of Sec. III that the contraction depends on the flow direction is reasonable. C. Scattering to Higher Harmonics Determined by CFD Simulations 1. Scattering to Higher Harmonics at the Helmholtz Resonator with Sym- metric Neck The amplitudes of the higher harmonicsn ~ω0 up to ordern /.0136 5 of the resonator response for an input SPL of 125 d B are plotted in Fig. 5 a for the fundamental excitation frequencyω0∕/.01332π/.0134 in the range of 200–700 Hz, corresponding to~ω0 ∈ /.01370.054; 1.087/.0138. All harmonics with larger order (n> 5) are negligible with a relative content of less than 2‰. It can be observed that the damping of the fundamental harmonic (line marked with ) is best close to the resonator eigenfrequency, i.e. where~ω0 is close to unity. On the other hand, scattering to higher harmonics mainly occurs close to that frequency. This is in line with expectations because the velocity in the neck is largest in this frequency range and is causing strong nonlinear effects here. Away from the eigenfrequency, velocities are smaller and the Fig. 4 Flow visualization in a 2-D cutting plane in the vicinity of the resonator neck/mouth during the inflow and outflow phases for the three configurations considered at excitation frequency close to the eigenfrequency~ω0 /.0136 1 with input SPL 125 d B for HRS and HRA, and with input SPL 160 d B for QW. On the upper half, the contraction is marked in green for each case. Article in Advance / FÖRNER ET AL. 7 Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on December 9, 2016 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 055295 A.4 Scattering to Higher Harmonics for Quarter-Wave and Helmhol tz Resonators system behaves almost linearly. As expected, the OHO pattern occurs (i.e. the odd harmonics contribute predominantly to the response), whereas the even harmonics are almost absent. The third harmonic (line marked with ) clearly dominates over the even ones (second is shown as, fourth is shown as ). The contribution of the harmonics becomes less and less considerable with increasing ordern. The impact of the fifth harmonic (line marked with nabla) is noticeably smaller than the third but is still more prominent than even harmonics. In Fig. 5 b, the scattering to the harmonics is depicted under variation of the input SPL for an excitation frequency close to eigenfrequency~ω0 ≈ 1 [corresponding toω0∕/.01332π/.0134/.0136 380 Hz]. The reflection coefficient and the resistance are presented in Fig. 6 ( ). Note that the reflection coefficient equals the scattering into the fundamental harmonic, which is also shown in Figs. 5 a and 5 b. With increasing input SPL, the fundamental harmonic first decays (up to 110 d B) because the resistance increases; see Fig. 6 b. The optimal damping for orthogonal incident acoustic waves is achieved with a normalized impedance of z /.0136 1. Increasing the excitation further leads to higher resistance, but the reflection also increases. This occurs due to the overdamping of the system. The trend of increasing resistance with increasing SPL can also be explained by studying the 1-D equation for the pressure drop; see Eq. (9). The only nonlinear term in this equation corresponds to the flow separation. The corresponding nonlinear resistance scales with the amplitude of the velocity in the neck, which itself increases with rising SPL. This can also be seen in experimental and numerical studies. The scattering to higher harmonics increases with increasing amplitude in the normal-damped range (z < 1). Close to the region of optimal damping (z /.0136 1), the scattering to higher harmonics abruptly attains a local minimum. This minimum cannot be explained with the analysis of Sec. III because the velocity in the neck is actually further increasing. Furthermore, the scattering to higher harmonics does not totally vanish for low amplitudes. The considerations made previously would actually suggest a monotonic increase of the scattering with the amplitude, starting with no scattering and reaching a) Helmholtz resonator HRS for input SPL 125 d B b) Helmholtz resonator HRS at ω 0 ≈ 1 (380 Hz) for variable-input SPL c) Helmholtz resonator with asymmetric neck HRA for input SPL 125 d B d) Helmholtz resonator with asymmetric neck HR at˜ ω 0 ≈ 1 (380 Hz) for variable-input SPL e) Quarter-wave resonator QW for input SPL 160 d B f) Quarter-wave resonator QW at ω0 ≈ 1 (580 Hz for variable-input SPL ˜ Fig. 5 Scattering to harmonics plotted in logarithmic scale: fundamental, second, third, forth, fifth. 8 Article in Advance / FÖRNER ET AL.

The reasons for the discrepancy to the presented simulation results are still unknown. In the overdamped range, the scattering increases again by increasing the input SPL. The overall scattering remains small for this resonator setup, even for very high excitation levels. Thus, modeling the nonlinear behavior only for the fundamental frequency~ω0 with the describing function approach (see Sec. II.A) reflects the main mechanisms accurately in that case. It can be observed that the OHO pattern vanishes in a range of very high SPL (≥130 d B), which is shaded in Figs. 5 b and 5 d (for HRA). The interaction of the vortices formed at leading and trailing edges is identified as the cause of this behavior. The exact mechanism and the circumstances when the OHO pattern is absent will be discussed in detail in a separate paper. 2. Scattering to Higher Harmonics at the Helmholtz Resonator with Asymmetric Neck The gain of the reflection coefficient and resistance for various SPLs are included in Fig. 6 for the configuration with the asymmetric neck HRA. The chamfer size is set such that the linear impedance is almost not influenced by the chamfer. Thus, the eigenfrequency remains the same as for HRS and the excitation for that case is set to 380 Hz. The nonlinear resistance can be observed to decrease slightly in comparison to the unchamfered case HRS; see Fig. 6 a. This decrease arises from the lower flow contraction during the outflow phase; see. The scattering to the harmonicsn ~ω0 (n ∈ f 1; 2; :::; 5 g) is shown for an input SPL of 125 d B in Fig. 5 c for a range of 200–700 Hz for the fundamental excitation frequency ω0∕/.01332π/.0134, corresponding to ~ω0 ∈ /.01370.068; 1.036/.0138. Moreover, the scattered higher harmonics are presented for an excitation close to eigenfrequency~ω0 ≈ 1 (corresponding to 380 Hz) with varying input SPLs in Fig. 5 d. As predicted, the second harmonic increases in comparison to HRS with symmetric neck. According to the analysis of Sec. III, the second harmonic should be weaker than the third but stronger than the fifth one. However, the increase of the second harmonic is moderate such that the second and fifth harmonics have about an equal strength in the CFD simulations. 3. Scattering to Higher Harmonics at the Quarter-Wave Resonator For the quarter-wave resonator, the behavior changes significantly with respect to the Helmholtz resonators. For QW, the scattering to higher harmonics is mostly into the second harmonic, which again fits well to the analysis of Sec. III. This can be seen in Fig. 5 e for a constant SPL of 160 d B and in Fig. 5 f for the excitation eigenfrequency close to eigenfrequency~ω0 ≈ 1 (corresponding to 580 Hz) in a range of 80–160 d B. The frequency sweep is performed for QW at 160 d B instead of 125 d B for Helmholtz resonator configurations due to the higher SPL required to trigger nonlinear behavior. This can be seen in Fig. 6 a ( ). For HRS, the resistance starts to increase at a SPL of about 105 d B due to nonlinear effects. For QW, this occurs at about 125 d B. This difference can be explained only partially due to the different open area ratiosσ. Thus, the different threshold to trigger nonlinearities originates mainly due to the different resonator concepts. Moreover, the overall scattering increases as well. The maximal scattering is in the order of 2% for the Helmholtz resonators. Here, for QW, the relative scattering to the second harmonic can reach values up to the order of 10%. This difference in magnitude of the Helmholtz and the quarter-wave resonator is backed by the quasi-steady analysis. V. Conclusions The nonlinear acoustic response of quarter-wave and Helmholtz resonators has been studied by means of compressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Particular attention was paid to the scattering to higher harmonics. For the Helmholtz resonators, the higher harmonics exhibited an odd-harmonics-only pattern, where only the odd harmonics were present, whereas the even ones were negligible. Such patterns were observed previously at symmetric orifices, and they were explained by a 1-D quasi-steady analysis based on the Bernoulli equation with suitable extra terms for the losses. The current study extended the analysis, such that it was also applicable to configurations that exhibited asymmetric flow patterns, e.g. Helmholtz resonators with asymmetric necks or quarter-wave resonators. The following observations are observed in CFD simulations and confirmed by the quasi-steady analysis: For the Helmholtz resonator with a symmetric neck, the scattering to higher harmonics exhibits the odd-harmonics-only (OHO) pattern. The OHO pattern is weaker if a Helmholtz resonator with an asymmetric neck is considered. It is concluded that the pure OHO pattern occurs due to the flow symmetry during the inflow and outflow phases through the symmetric resonator neck. For the quarter-wave resonator, corresponding to a simple discontinuity in the cross-sectional area in the 1-D compact analysis, a larger threshold for the excitation is required to trigger noticeable nonlinear effects. If scattering takes place in this configuration, the second harmonic is the dominant higher harmonic, and the OHO pattern vanishes completely. Overall, the scattering to higher harmonics is more pronounced for the quarter-wave resonator, for which values up to the order of 10% of the incident wave are observed. In contrast, Helmholtz resonators exhibit quite moderate nonlinear scattering (up to 2%), even for very high excitation levels. One may conclude that, in many cases, describing functions for impedance or reflection coefficients characterize the nonlinear response of resonators with acceptable accuracy. Appendix: Solver Validation in the Nonlinear Regime The solver validation in the nonlinear regime is presented using impedance describing function measurements performed by M. A. Temiz (see footnote¶) from the Eindhoven University of Technology on configuration HRS in a frequency range of Hz corresponding to~ω0 ∈ /.01370.027; 1.087/.0138.

In those simulations, the input amplitudes of thef wave are set in a way that the acoustic SPL directly in front of neck matches the target value. Because the nonlinear effects mainly affect the resistance R/.0133 z/.0134, it is more challenging to capture this quantity correctly in the CFD simulation (see Fig. A 1 a) than the reactance I/.0133 z/.0134, which always fits very accurately (see Fig. A 1 b). The curves agree quite reasonably, but the numerics slightly overpredict the nonlinear resistance. A reason for this is (at least partially) that the edges in the CFD mesh are perfectly sharp, whereas the real sample is not due to manufacturing reasons. The measurements are also a bit shaky away from the eigenfrequency. This shaky behavior does not originate from physics but from the ill-conditioned transformation from the reflection coefficient to resistance. The reflection coefficient is in both the experiment and CFD the quantity that is directly and subsequently transformed to the impedance. Thus, a comparison in the reflection coefficient is more suitable. This is depicted in Figs. A 1 c and A 1 d. Here, the curve match is almost perfect and shows the quality of the computational setup.

At low sound pressure level, thermo-viscous effects dominate this dissipation. This is linear, i. e. independent of perturbation amplitude. LES/system identiﬁcation methods are applied in this study to the linear regime. For that purpose, the system is interpreted as a single-input / single-output system of two characteristic waves. An Output-Error model for the reﬂection coefﬁcient valid for the whole frequency range of interest is estimated from a single LES time series. The resonator admittance and impedance are derived from that model. For a set of test cases, comparison against experimental results and established models shows good agreement for the gain and phase of the admittance as well as of the reactance. The acoustic resistance value is captured with good accuracy close the eigenfrequency of the resonator. 1. Introduction Acoustic resonators, such as Helmholtz resonators, perforated liners, or quarter wave length cav- ities, are commonly used to induce dissipation of acoustic energy in combustion systems like rocket combustion chambers, aero-engines, or gas turbines. Thus, they can stabilize the combustion process or reduce the emitted sound to the environment. The acoustic behavior of such resonators is often characterized by their acoustic impedance. The impedance describes the ratio of pressure and acoustic velocity and, thus, also how much energy is dissipated in the device. In the literature, there are several studies available that determine resonator impedance by empirical, analytical, or numerical means in dependency of frequency and sound pres- sure level (SPL). For example, Hershet al and Melling carried out experiments. For analytical derivations, refer for instance to. These analytical models introduce empirical correlation fac- tors. Numerical studies approximating the impedance can be found, e. g. in. But none of these studies applies system identiﬁcation (SI) methods as it is done here. SI methods promise accurate estimations over the whole frequency range of interest using a single time series data set. In this study, the damping behavior of the Helmholtz resonator is examined numerically using the LES/SI approach and is organized as follows: First in Sec. 2, fundamentals of the Helmholtz res- onator are reviewed and discussed. In Sec. 3, the answer of the resonator to well-designed broadband excitation is tracked. The gained CFD input-output data is used to perform a SI in the linear regime. The estimated reﬂection coefﬁcient model and the derived the admittance as well as the impedance are validated against experiments and analysis before a conclusion and outlook are given in Sec. 4.

Figure 2: Block diagram of a generic discrete linear model with inputf[k] and output g [k]. 2. Analysis of the Helmholtz Resonator A Helmholtz resonator as sketched in Fig. 1 consists of a compact volume connected to the cham- ber by its neck. Qualitatively, the behavior of this resonator can be described as a mass-spring-damper system. The mass of the gas inside the neck is accelerated by the ﬂuctuating chamber pressure. On the other side, the compressible gas in the backing volume acts as a spring. The motion in the neck causes viscous losses close to the walls. Increasing the excitation amplitudes leads to ﬂow separation at the neck of the resonator, which converts acoustic perturbation energy to the hydrodynamic mode. The vortices formed remain laminar for moderate excitation levels and turn turbulent for yet larger levels. This effect is strongly nonlinear and increases the dissipation considerably. Close to the eigen- frequency of this systems, the motion in the neck is strongest and thus most acoustical losses occur in that frequency range. Starting from mass and momentum equations, Keller and Zauner developed the following expression for the ﬂuctuating velocity u ′ in the neck: (1) (1 + s) le ¯ρ   I ¨u ′ + ( s¯ρ(l 0 + ls)ω   IIa + ζ ¯ρ ⏐ ⏐u ′ ⏐ ⏐   IIb ) ˙u ′ + A¯ρc 2 V III u = − ˙p ′  IV. Hereby, the parameters A and l 0 refer to the neck area and length, respectively. The corrected length le corresponds to the neck length plus a correction taking the additional mass next to the neck ends into account which participates in the oscillation. Similarly, ls denotes a friction correction length and ζ ≈ 1 − (d 0/d cav)4. The density is denoted by ¯ρ and the ﬂuctuating pressure by p ′. The so-called boundary layer parameter s reﬂects the thermo-viscous dissipation. This semi-analytical equation clearly shows the character of a mass-spring-damper system as described above, which is excited by the external ﬂuctuating pressure p ′ (term IV). T erm I accounts for the inertia of the mass within the neck. The compressibility of the backing volume is reﬂected in term III. The losses are included in terms II, where the ﬁrst one (a) reﬂects the linear, thermo-viscous dissipation due to friction of the oscillating ﬂuid at the neck walls. The second term (b) accounts for the nonlinear losses due to vortex shedding. This is illustrated in Fig. 3: For a small excitation amplitude, the ﬂow does not separate as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Increasing the amplitude leads vortex shedding at the edges and the ﬂow looses its largely irrotational nature as show in Fig. 3(b). By this process, energy is extracted from the acoustic mode – which is irrotational – and fed into a hydrodynamic mode in form of vortices. These vortices are ﬁnally dissipated by the turbulent cascade process. For small Stokes numbers d 0 ≪ δs, the boundary layer parameter can be estimated as s = 1/d 0(1 + ( κ − 1)/ √ P r) √ 2ν/ω. The variables P r, κ, and ν denote the Prandl number, the heat ca- pacity ratio, and the kinematic viscosity, respectively. According to Ingard, the correction lengths can be estimated asls ≈ d 0 and, for large aspect ratios ( d 0/ 3√ V ≪ 1), le ≈ l 0 + 8/ (3π)d 0. 2 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 A.5 Aeroacoustic Characterization of Helmholtz Resonators in the Linear Regime with System Identiﬁcation The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration (a) Linear Regime, 100 d B ( Q = 2 e 4).

Figure 3: V ortices visualized by isosurfaces of the Q-criterion for different SPLs 1 during the inﬂow excited close to eigenfrequency; background colored by vorticity in logarithmic scale. The behavior of an acoustic resonator is often described in the frequency domain. Assuming harmonic periodicity – i. e. u ′ = ˆu eiωt and p ′ = ˆp eiωt – Eq. (1) can be rewritten as (2) (1 + s) le ¯ρωi ˆu + (s¯ρ(l 0 + ls)ω + ζ ¯ρˆu) ˆu − A¯ρc 2 V ω i ˆu = −ˆp. The angular eigenfrequency of this system is given as: (3)ωeig = c √ A V (1 + s) le. Introducing the crude linearization ζ ¯ρˆu 2 ≈ ϵnls¯ρ d 0ωˆu with a loss factor ϵnl, Eq. (2) can be rewrit- ten in terms of the impedance : (4)Zm(ω) = ˆp ˆu = ¯ρ ( 1 + κ − 1√ P r )( 1 + ϵnl + l 0 d 0 ) √ 2νω + i ( le ¯ρω(1 + s) − A¯ρc 2 V ω ). Note that such a nonlinear factor ϵnl depends on both the geometry and strongly on the SPL. For the following comparison, the impedance expression of the cavity mouth Zm is scaled by the area ratio of the tube to mouth, i. e. Z = d 2 cav/d 2 0 Zm. The real part of the impedance Z is referred to as resistance and its imaginary part as reactance. 3. System Identiﬁcation in the Linear Regime In this section, the geometric and numerical setup used in this study are presented. Linear SI methods are introduced before the results of the identiﬁcation are compared against analytical and empirical descriptions. 3.01 Geometric and Numerical Setup The response of a Helmholtz resonator as sketched in Fig. 1 with a cylindrical neck and the backing volume is investigated numerically for three cases listed in T ab. 1 under ambient conditions. For validation purposes, the setups are chosen corresponding to the study of Hershet al. 1 20 log 10(prms/ 20 µPa) ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 3 Reproduction of Papers The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration Case I Case II Case III Cases I – III l 0 l 0 l 0 d 0 lcav dcav 5. 08 cm 0. 635 cm 0. 159 cm 0. 635 cm 2. 54 cm 5. 08 cm T able 1: Geometry dimensions for the three cases investigated this study. Acoustic excitation is imposed at the boundary opposite to the resonator situated at a distance lsim = 10 cm. Shortly after this inlet, area averaged measurements are evaluated across a reference plane. The computational domain is set long enough such that non-acoustic disturbances occur- ring closer to the resonator do not inﬂuence the measurements. The acoustics is modeled using two Riemann invariantsf and g which can be imaged as waves traveling with the speed of sound c in right and left direction, respectively. In absence of mean ﬂow as in this study, they are deﬁned as f= 1 / 2(p ′ / (¯ρc) + u ′ ) and g = 1 / 2(p ′ / (¯ρc) − u ′ ). At the inlet, a f wave signal can be imposed and low acoustic reﬂection of the outgoing g wave is realized by using Navier-Stokes characteristics boundary conditions (NSCBC), c. f. For the hard walls, no-slip boundary conditions are set, whereas, for the artiﬁcial boundaries marked by dashed lines in Fig. 1, slip conditions are utilized. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations with k-equation eddy-viscosity model are solved using the Pimple algorithm of Open FOAM on block structured o-grids with at least 0.085 million cells. Each mesh resolution close to the neck walls is set ﬁne enough to resolve the boundary layer for the frequency range of interest well. The boundary thickness can be estimated with the Stokes length δs = 2 π √ 2ν/ω, c. f. A comparison of radial proﬁle of the root mean square of the axial velocity in the middle of the neck against the analytical solution in a inﬁnitely long pipe shows a good agreement, indicating that the boundary layer is resolved well. In the main parts, the acoustic CFL numberc ∆ t/ ∆ x is clearly below unity. Close to the walls, this number is larger, but, by using implicit time integration, the acoustics are still resolved accurately in those regions. It should be emphasized that the tolerance for stop criterion for outer iteration loops accounting for compressible pressure- velocity coupling must be set low. Otherwise, the simulation could easily fail to express the speed of sound correctly and, accordingly, the a wrong resonator eigenfrequency would be predicted. For the identiﬁcation, a broadband input signal with a SPL of 75 d B is generated. A priori monofrequent simulations close to the eigenfrequency showed (see, e. g. in Fig. 3) that for such a moderate excitation level the ﬂow remains in the linear regime for the frequency range of interest, i. e. the ﬂow does not separate at the edges. In other words, the dominant nonlinearity in Eq. (1) - term IIb - stays small. The signal is designed in a way that it excites the whole frequency spectrum of interest and steep changes in the input signal are avoided, which could otherwise cause numerical difﬁculties. The requirements above are satisﬁed by a signal construction according to. Dou- bling the number of cells provides a very similar response to such a signal. Thus, the solution can be expected to be independent of the mesh in the linear regime. 3.02 Methodology In this section, linear SI methods are applied to identify a model of the resonator dynamics. Such methods have already been successfully applied to other thermo- or aero-acoustic systems, see, e. g. a review by Polifke or Jaenschet al for recent developments. Linear SI methods are only applicable to dynamical systems behaving predominately in a linear manner. By construction of the input signal, this condition is satisﬁed, see Sec. 3.01. Thus, the following analysis is clearly restricted to the linear regime without ﬂow separation. Using this methodology, the reﬂection coefﬁcient over the whole frequency range of interest is estimated from time series data of a single, broadband excited CFD simulation. The resonator can be considered as a single-input / single-output (SISO) system with input and output data f[k] and g[k], respectively. Hereby, k denotes the discrete time k = t/ ∆ t where ∆ t is the 4 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 A.5 Aeroacoustic Characterization of Helmholtz Resonators in the Linear Regime with System Identiﬁcation The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration sampling interval. The general form of a linear, parametric model is given as (5)A(q−1) g[k] = B(q−1) F (q−1) f[k] + C(q−1) D(q−1) e[k], where q stands for the time shift operator and e[k] is Gaussian white noise. The variables A, B, C, D, and F are polynomials in q−1, so for instance A(q−1) = ∑ na i=0 ai q−i. The polynomials A, C, D, and F are deﬁned such their 0 th coefﬁcients are unity, thus a 0 = c 0 = d 0 = f 0 = 1. Figure 2 illustrates this process as a block diagram. The possible inﬁnite answer of a sys- tem can be parametrized by the ﬁnite set of polynomial coefﬁcients collected in the vector θ = (a 1, a na, b 0, b nb−1, c 1, c nc, d 1, d nd, f 1, f nf )T. Setting restrictions on these poly- nomials corresponds to choosing a speciﬁc model for the identiﬁcation. The system is described by two transfer functions, one for the input data R and one for the noise H. They are given as (6) R(q−1) = B(q−1) A(q−1) F (q−1) and H(q−1) = C(q−1) A(q−1) D(q−1). Knowing the parameters θ and all previous time steps up to k − 1, the one step ahead prediction ˜g[k|k − 1](θ) for the next observed value g[k] is calculated as (7) ˜g[k|k − 1](θ) = H−1(q−1)R(q−1) f[k] + ( 1 − H(q−1) ) g[k]. Now, the parameters θ are determined in such a way that the squares of the discrepancies are mini- mized, i. e. the following optimization problem has to be solved: (8)ˆθ = argmin θ ∑ k (y[k] − ˜y[k|k − 1](θ))2. The estimated model is assign with these optimal parameters ˆθ. This procedure is called prediction- error minimization (PEM). In this study, the Output-Error model is applied. This corresponds to a case where A as well as the noise model H are set to unity in Eq. (6) and the other polynomials can be chosen independently. This model was chosen since it turned out that modeling the error does not bring beneﬁts for the resonator setup in the linear regime. Before identiﬁcation, the CFD time series are shifted with respect to each other to account for the time it takes to travel from the reference plane to the resonator and back. Moreover, the CFD raw data, which is highly resolved in time, is downsampled in order to stabilize the identiﬁcation process. 3.03 Results In the following, the properties of estimated 2 nd order Output-Error models ( nf = 2, nb = 3 ) for the three test cases (see T ab. 1) are discussed and compared to experimental results as well as to the analytic behavior described by Eq. (4). The nonlinear factorϵnl is estimated according to Garrison et al as ϵnl ≈ 1. 62 (p 0/ 47. 88 Pa)0. 93, where p 0 is the amplitude of the incoming wave. In the linear regime, the value of the expression above is – as expected – quite small ( 0. 0043). In all the following plots it is evident that the analytical model predicts a too low eigenfrequency for short neck lengths. This fact is not mentioned explicitly anymore. From the estimated reﬂection coefﬁcient R, the normalized impedance Z and admittance Y = 1/Z can be derived from the relation (9) R(ω) = ˆg ˆf = Z − 1 Z + 1 = 1 − Y 1 + Y, ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 5 Reproduction of Papers The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration 200 400 600 8000 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 f [Hz] |R| [−] (a) Gain. 200 400 600 800−2π −π f [Hz] phase(R) [rad] (b) Phase.

Both the impedance Y and admittance Z are both normalized using the free impedance ¯ρc in the following. The frequency response of R for these approaches and for all test cases is plotted in Fig. 4. The band stop character of R can clearly be observed considering the gain curves in Fig. 4(a). In the vicin- ity of the corresponding eigenfrequency, the gain is small, whereas it is close to unity away from this range. The three gain curves qualitatively match for all test cases. The estimated models capture the gain at eigenfrequency correctly, whereas the analytical model underestimates this quantity slightly. The phase of the response shown in Fig. 4(b) behaves similarly for all approaches. For low and high frequencies, the input and output signals are in phase and close to the eigenfrequency in antiphase. The frequency response of the normalized admittance Y is displayed in Fig. 5. The admittance can be interpreted as the transfer function of the SISO system with ﬂuctuating pressure ˆp ′ as input and velocity ˆu ′ as output. The gain shows a high resonant response close to the eigenfrequency, see Fig. 5(a). Figure 5(b) presents the corresponding phase curve for the admittance. For low and high frequencies the phase difference ofˆp ′ and ˆu ′ is π/ 2 and −π/ 2, respectively. At the eigenfrequency, the signals ˆp ′ and ˆu ′ are in phase. This behavior is described in the same way for the three cases. Figure 6 shows the normalized impedance Z in its resistance/reactance representation. The reac- tance curves of the different approaches shown in Fig. 6(b) agree very well with each other for all cases. The magnitudes of the resistance are estimated correctly close to the corresponding eigenfre- quency by the Output-Error models even though the trends are expressed incorrectly, see Fig. 6(a). This discrepancy in the trend can be explained with the ill-conditioned transformation from R to the resistance Re(Z). A way from the eigenfrequency, the reactance dominates the impedance due to its larger numerical value and, thus, a wrong trend in the resistance is not manifested in the reﬂection coefﬁcient as long as its value is good close to the eigenfrequency. The analytic model reﬂects the trend well, but the absolute values of the resistance are underestimated for the three test cases. 4. Conclusion and Outlook The dynamic behavior of a Helmholtz Resonator has been analyzed. First, an analytical approach has been reviewed, where the movement of the gaseous mass within the neck is described in analogy to a mass-spring-damper system. By linearization of the nonlinear ODE derived from that model, an impedance model can be derived. The ﬂow in the vicinity of the neck has been examined by means of CFD simulations. For low SPLs, the ﬂow does not separate at the edges and, thus, the resonator dynamics can be expected to behave linear in that regime. At higher excitation amplitudes, vortex shedding occurs, which leads to additional, nonlinear damping. In the linear regime, a system identiﬁcation has been performed on broadband CFD time series data using a 2 nd order Output-Error model. This process provides a model that is valid over the whole frequency range of interest using the data of a single simulation. From the estimated reﬂection coefﬁ- cient, the admittance as well as the impedance have been derived. The estimated quantities of each test case have been compared to analytical and empirical descriptions. The reﬂection coefﬁcient and the admittance have always matched the reference values very well. Choosing the resistance/reactance representation for the impedance, the values of the reactance curves have agreed with each other for all three approaches. The resistance values close to the corresponding eigenfrequency have been caught well by the estimated models, but have shown wrong trends due to the ill-conditioned relation of resistance to reﬂection coefﬁcient. The present results demonstrate the feasibility of the CFD/SI method for this type of problem. The CFD/SI approach will be extended to the nonlinear regime in order to describe the resonator behavior at higher SPLs. Nonlinear SI methods, as for instance neural networks, can in principle account for such effects.

Lopez Arteaga Keywords: Helmholtz resonator Acoustic liner Nonlinear acoustics Nonlinear system identification CFD/SI Impedance abstract The nonlinear acoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators is characterized by a data-based reduced-order model, which is obtained by a combination of high-resolution CFD simu- lation and system identification. It is shown that even in the nonlinear regime, a linear model is capable of describing the reflection behavior at a particular amplitude with quantitative accuracy. This observation motivates to choose alocal-linear model structure for this study, which consists of a network of parallel linear submodels. A so-called fuzzy- neuron layer distributes the input signal over the linear submodels, depending on the root mean square of the particle velocity at the resonator surface. The resulting model struc- ture is referred to as anlocal-linear neuro-fuzzy network. System identification techniques are used to estimate the free parameters of this model from training data. The training data are generated by CFD simulations of the resonator, with persistent acoustic excitation over a wide range of frequencies and sound pressure levels. The estimated nonlinear, reduced-order models show good agreement with CFD and experimental data over a wide range of amplitudes for several test cases. & 2017 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Helmholtz resonators, as schematically sketched in Fig. 1, are used in various industrial applications to absorb sound. Arrays of such resonators are applied as liners in jet engines to reduce the emission of sound to the environment[1,p.2 1 4 f f ].C o m b u s t i o n systems as for instance gas turbines can become thermoacoustically unstable due to the feedback between the unsteady heat release and the acoustics within the chamber. Helmholtz resonators are often inserted to stabilize the combustion process. The present paper introduces a data-based reduced-order model (ROM), a so-called local-linear neuro-fuzzy network. This model is defined in the time domain, is capable of considering a change in amplitude, and can capture nonlinear effects. The data for the identification of the model parameters is generated by broadband CFD simulation. Once such a ROM is identified, it can be evaluated efficiently and may serve, e.g. as a nonlinear boundary condition in simulations of com- pressible flow that require acoustic boundary conditions (BC), such as computational aeroacoustics (CAA). Moreover, the methodology proposed characterizes the nonlinear resonator behavior in an efficient and robust manner, and can thus support the proper tuning of a resonator. As mentioned above, the resonator can respond in a linear and nonlinear fashion. Linear behavior of a system means that the relation between the system input and its output can be described by a linear transfer function.

Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190 Reproduction of Papers function can easily be transformed from the frequency/Laplace space to the time domain and vice versa by using the direct and inverse Fourier/Laplace transformation, respectively. If the resonator operates in the linear regime, its response is fully characterized by its impedance or equivalently by its reflection coefficient. Such a linear relation is valid for low acoustic amplitudes. However, when the particle velocity in the resonator neck increases beyond a certain level, the flow separates at the edges of the resonator leading to nonlinear effects as already early described by Sivian as well as by Ingård and Labate. The nonlinear behavior of an acoustic resonator manifests itself in several aspects: The most prominent nonlinear effect is that the harmonic behavior changes with the excitation amplitude. This effect can be modeled with animpedance describing function, which gives the impedance in dependency on the applied sound pressure level (SPL), see, e.g. Hersh et al. For many technical applications, the impedance describing function captures much of the dynamics for constant acoustic amplitudes. Scattering to higher harmonics cannot be described by the impedance describing function, but this scattering remains on a very moderate level for Helmholtz resonators, see Förner et al. Moreover, the acoustic behavior at a certain frequency can noticeably be influenced by multi-tonal excitation, which means that in the excitation signal not only the that single frequency is present but also multiples of this frequencies, see Bodén Boden 13, Boden 16 and Serrano et al. Most available models are based on the first principle 1-D analysis of the fluctuating mass in the resonator neck, see, e.g. Rice, Cummings,M a a[1 1]as well as Hersh et al. An impedance describing function can be derived in a semi- analytical manner. Good agreement with experiments is achieved once the values of a set of correction parameters are correctly assigned. Such correction parameters are usually provided via correlation analysis and are valid for fixed amplitudes. That is why the transformation of this kind of model into time domain, where amplitudes vary dynamically, is not a trivial task. The present methodology requires CFD simulations and broadband data analysis. Bodén performed experi- mentally broadband forcing of an orifice and applied correlation analysis to separate the linear and the nonlinear con- tribution. Tam et al compared their direct numerical simulations (DNS) excited by a broadband signal against ex- periments. Tam et al already showed in preceding studies the potential of simulation to capture the resonator dynamics. The impact of purging flow is investigated via large eddy simulation by Mendez and Eldredge. In a series of papers, Zhang and Bodony studied the effect of high amplitude excitation as well as the influence of laminar and turbulent grazing flow using the DNS approach, see e.g. The methodology proposed in this study applies the computational fluid dynamics/system identification (CFD/SI) ap- proach to estimate a ROM, see Polifke. Since usually a model structure is specified without considering explicitly the physics involved, such a model is called a“black-box model” in contrast to a“white-box model” derived from first principles. The model parameters are deduced from CFD time series, the so-called training data. In principle, the training data set can also be provided by experiment. This time series must cover the entire frequency range of interest for linear SI and also the entire amplitude range for nonlinear SI. Once the model structure is fixed, the model parameters are determined such that the difference between the model output and the training data is minimized in terms of a suitable norm. In order to ascertain good model performance, the estimated model is subsequently validated against an independent test data set. This methodology is applied in this study to several test cases without mean flow under ambient conditions. Since no restricting assumptions are made on the model structure, the proposed model should also be capable of characterizing more complex resonator configurations, as, e.g. in presence of purging or grazing flows, as well as other aeroacoustic devices, as for instance orifices. Förner and Polifke showed that the CFD/SI approach can provide quantitatively accurate black-box models for the Helmholtz resonator dynamics in the linear regime, i.e. for low excitation amplitudes. Only a very limited number of linear black-box models are available; the so-called output-error (OE) model has shown good performance. However, there exists a large variety of nonlinear models which can be used for SI. Representatives of nonlinear black-box models are Volterra series as well as artificial neural networks. These models are in principle capable of modeling any nonlinear behavior. However, for the test cases considered, a huge number of model parameters was required such that identification results that were achieved with reasonably long time series were not robust. Therefore, this study introduces a“gray-box model” structure that exploits a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Neuro-fuzzy networks offer the opportunity to incorporate such knowledge in the model structure, see, e.g. Nelles or Fig. 1. Sketch with dimensioning of a Helmholtz resonator with acoustic wavesf and g. K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190 171 A.6 Nonlinear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Helmholtz Reso nators with a Local-Linear Neuro-Fuzzy Model Babuška and Verbruggen. Building a network containing so-called fuzzy neurons offers additional freedom in the modeling. A fuzzy neuron applies a so-called membership function and becomes active only under certain conditions. The membership function takes a value within the interval []0, 1. If these conditions are fully or not at all satisfied, true (1) or false (0) is assigned to this function, respectively. However, the membership function cannot only take on the values“true” and “false”, as in Boolean logic, but it can take on also every intermediate state in the interval[]0, 1, as in fuzzy logic. The paper is organized as follows:Section 2 introduces acoustical quantities and the underlying physical mechanisms as well as the geometrical and computational setups of the present study. The linear system identification process using an output-error model is shown in Section 3. Moreover, the ability of that model type to characterize the resonator behavior in the linear regime as well as in the nonlinear regime in a local-linear fashion are discussed here. In Section 4, a local-linear neuro-fuzzy model to identify the nonlinear resonator response is proposed and an algorithm for the estimation of the free model parameter is derived. This procedure is applied to several test cases and validated against experimental data from the literature in Section 5. Conclusion and outlook are offered in Section 6. 2. Acoustical background and CFD setup A Helmholtz resonator consists of a backing volume connected via a small neck to a larger volume as sketched in Fig. 1. This study considers resonators that are cylindrical, with lengthsl 0, lcav as well as diametersd 0, dcav of the neck and the backing volume, respectively. The open area ratiodd/0 cav 2 is denoted bys. In the next section (Section 2.01), physical quantities to describe the resonator absorption behavior are introduced, and the pertinent mechanisms are outlined. The numerical setup used in the current study and a validation of the CFD solver is presented in Section 2.02. The design of the input signals is discussed here. Finally, the test cases considered are introduced in Section 2.03. 2.01. Acoustical quantities and physical mechanisms The behavior of an acoustic resonator is often described in the frequency domain byits impedance Z. It is defined as the ratio of the Fourier transforms (^. ) of the fluctuating acoustic pressure′p and velocity ′u normal to the reference surface atxref : ωω ρ() = () = ^ ^ ()Zz c p u. 10 0 The real part of the impedance is referred to asresistance and its imaginary part asreactance. Usually, the impedance is normalized with the specific impedanceρ c 0 0,w h e r eρ0 and c 0 denote the mean density and the speed of sound, respectively. The resonator can also be characterized in terms of characteristic wave amplitudesf and g, assuming 1-D acoustics in front of the resonator. Thesef and g can be considered as right and left traveling waves, respectively. In absence of mean flow, as in this study, they are defined as ρρ= ′ +′ = ′ −′ () ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟f p c ug p c u 1 2 and 1 2. 20 0 0 0 The ratio of a normally incident wave^f to the reflected^g wave in frequency domain is calledreflection coefficient R: ω() = ^ ^ = − + () R g f z z 1. The resonator behavior is often approximated with a simplified 1-D ordinary differential equation, see for instance Keller and Zauner or Bodén and Zhou, which helps to understand the fundamental behavior of the resonator: ⏟ ⏟ ρ σ ρ σ ρ(+ Δ ) ¨ ′ +′ + ̇′′ +′ = − ̇′ ()         ll u Ru uu C c l up 1 2. l d 0 0 I IIa 0 22 IIb 0 0 cav III IV The equation above has the structure of a mass-spring-damper system. The acoustic pressure (term IV) is driving the mass in the neck of the resonator. This oscillating mass is proportional to the geometrical length of the neckl 0, elongated by a length correction Δl, cf. Ingard. This correction accounts for the fluid in the vicinity of the neck taking part in the oscillation (term I). The resonator backing volume is filled with a compressible fluid, which acts like a spring (III). Losses are induced due to thermo-viscous losses described by the constant R l (IIa) and due to flow separation (IIb). In the IIb-term, also the effect of flow contraction is captured in the so-called discharge coefficient Cd. For a harmonic signal ω′( ) = ( )ut A t sinu, the term ̇′ ′uu can be approximated by ′Auu and, accordingly, the impedance can be described as: K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190172 Reproduction of Papers ω σ ρ ω σ ρ() = + + ( + Δ ) − () ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ZR A C il l c l 2. l u d 22 0 0 0 0 cav In the formula above, it can be seen that an amplitude variation has a huge impact on the impedance. The nonlinear resistance IIb is influenced, since A u explicitly appears there. Also, the discharge coefficient Cd varies since the flow con- traction mechanisms also depend on the amplitude. Moreover, the length correctionΔl for the effective length in the reactance is also known to vary with the excitation amplitude, see for instance Ingard or Temiz et al. In the range of small amplitudes, these effects are negligible, and the resonator is said to operate in thelinear regime. With rising amplitudes, the nonlinear effects described above have a huge impact on the resonator response in thenonlinear regime.I n the expressions above, a harmonic forcing with amplitude Au is assumed. In the case of non-harmonic excitation, the root mean square (rms) of the velocity (for a fixed geometry) seems to be the parameter controlling the nonlinear behavior, see Bodén. The strength of an acoustic signal is usually measured as SPL, which is defined via the rms of the acoustic pressure prms and the reference pressure =μp 20 Paref as = () ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ p p SPL 20 log d B. rms ref The expected behavior from the 1-D consideration above fits to experiments as for instance shown in Fig. 2 with measurements reproduced from Hersh et al for the test case HR 1 (defined in Section 2.03). The resistance gets larger with increasing SPL, see, e.g.Fig. 2 on the left-hand side. The eigenfrequency can be detected by the zero-crossing of the re- actance. In Fig. 2 on the right, it can be observed that the eigenfrequency shifts slightly to higher frequencies. The zero- crossing of the 140 d B reactance curve is at a higher frequency in comparison to the other curves. This nonlinear behavior manifests itself in the corresponding reflection coefficient as follows (see Fig. 3): First, the maximal absorption increases Fig. 2.

Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190 173 A.6 Nonlinear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Helmholtz Reso nators with a Local-Linear Neuro-Fuzzy Model with SPL in the lower SPL range. When the normalized resistance exceeds unity, the maximal absorption decreases due to the so-calledover-damping of the system, but the frequency bandwidth of high absorption becomes wider. For such an over- damped system, the phase curve differs from a normally damped system, see Fig. 3 on the right-hand side. All R-curves are in phase at frequencies far away from the eigenfrequency. Close to the eigenfrequency, normally damped systems are in antiphase, while over-damped systems are in phase. 2.02. CFD setup and solver validation With the CFD/SI approach, training data for black-box ROMs are acquired from CFD simulations as time series of fluc- tuating flow variables. The CFD simulations are performed with Open FOAM solving the compressible, transient Navier- Stokes equations using the PIMPLE algorithm. The acoustic inlet boundary is realized with the Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBC) suggested by Poinsot and Lele, where an arbitrary signal for thef wave traveling into the domain can be imposed, while maintaining a low reflection coefficient for the outgoingg wave. More details on the nu- merical solver are given by. Results from a solver validation study for test case HR 1 (defined in Section 2.03) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. These figures show the normalized impedance and the reflection coefficient for experiments and CFD simulations considering three SPLs namely for 120, 130, and 140 d B. The numerics over-predict the resistance moderately for the 140 d B case and very slightly for the 130 d B case. Besides that small deviation in the resistance for high SPLs, all curves agree reasonably well. It can be concluded that the CFD simulation performed on a 3-D grid with 1.08 million cells is capable of capturing the acoustics in the nonlinear regime. In order to compare simulations with measurements, the input amplitude of thef waves must be set such that the superposition off and reflected waveg ¼ Rf matches the desired total SPL, cf. Eq. (2). Unless the reflection coefficient R is known a priori, an iterative process setting the input amplitude is required. Note that such an iterative approach of is used solely for validation purposes in this study. Besides that, the SPL in the CFD simulations is set only with respect to the input signalf, ignoring the reflected acousticg wave, as it is also done by other authors, for instance by Zhang and Bodony. This will be referred to asincident SPLin the following. Note that in general the incident SPLs and the actual total SPL differ from each other. For the SI, broadband input-output data are required, which are generated by the CFD simulation. The time series of the acoustic forcingf wave and of the reflectedg wave serve as input and output data set, respectively. Since the influence of 3-D effects is minor for the test cases considered, the broadband data for the SI was generated on a 2-D axisymmetric mesh. The acoustic input signals for thef wave are generated according to Föller and Polifke. This signal is designed such that it excites the entire frequency spectrum of interest while avoiding rapid changes in the input signal, which could cause numerical difficulties. Moreover, it shows a low autocorrelation. Otherwise, the SI might fail if an input signal with high autocorrelation would be considered. The amplitude of this signal is successively ramped up in time to cover a wide range of amplitudes for the nonlinear SI. The signal with a length of 0.05 s is divided into equally sized parts on which the amplitude either is set constant or increases linearly in time to the next amplitude plateau. Thenonlinear signal assesses the amplitude plateaus with incident SPLs of 75 d B, 110 d B, 120 d B, 130 d B, 140 d B, and 150 d B, respectively. This signal is plotted below in Fig. 9 of Section 4.02. For validation purposes, a second uncorrelated signal is generated and ramped up in the same manner. 2.03. Test cases Four test cases are considered in the present study. Their geometrical values are given in Table 1. To have access to experimental validation data, the test cases HR 1, HR 2, and HR 3 are set as in Hersh et al. Test case HR 4 corresponds to the test rig of Temiz. 3. Linear system identification on specified amplitude regimes The idea of the CFD/SI approach is to estimate a ROM from time series generated by CFD simulation. The model structure is defined a priori, and the free model parameters are set such that a suitable objective function describing the difference Table 1 Geometry dimensions and properties for the test cases investigated in this study. The first three configuration are set according to Hersh et al and the HR 4 according to Temiz.

Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190174 Reproduction of Papers between the model prediction and the CFD data is minimized. To achieve a good result, the chosen model structure has to be suitable to describe the phenomena. Förner and Polifke have shown that a second-order output-error model captures the linear dynamics of a Helmholtz resonator with good accuracy. Such a model is by design linear and thus cannot exhibit any amplitude-dependent behavior. However, it will be shown in Section 3.04 that such a model can describe the linearized behavior for a fixed SPL regime. But first the model structure and the estimation procedure are introduced in the next sub-section (Section 3.01). Linear models are estimated for the considered test cases in Section 3.02 and the uncertainty associated with the identification process is discussed in Section 3.03. 3.01. Methodology of an output-error model estimation Since the CFD time series is a discrete time series, also the models have to be defined in a discrete framework. The time series is sampled equidistantly with a constant time stepΔt. The discrete time indexk denotes the sample for the instant in time =( − ) Δtk t 1 k. The response of an output-error model– see the block diagram in Fig. 4– depends on present and previous input as well as on previous output. The time-discrete output-error model for the input[ ]fk and the output [ ]g k is given as a filter, which may formally be written as a fraction of two polynomials in the time shift operator 1 q: [] = () () [] + [] = ++ ⋯ + ++ ⋯ + [] + [] () −− + −−gk Bq Fq fk ek bb q b q fq f q fk ek. n n n n b b f f The equation above models the transfer behavior=RB F/. Since no perfect match between the CFD data and the estimated model can be achieved,“noise” [ ]ek is considered in the estimation process. The noise is the difference between the CFD output and the output of the estimated model, which is assumed to be white colored. In other words, it is assumed that there remains no further information in noise, i.e. the difference of CFD and model output. The order of the transfer function Ris determined by the number of free parametersn b and nf in numerator and denominator, respectively. In the present study, nb ¼ 3 and nf ¼ 2 for all cases considered. All free parameters are assembled in the vector θ =( … … )bb b ff f, n n T OE 0 1 12 b f. The task in the system identification process is to estimate the optimal values of parametersθ^ OE. For that purpose, the time series data of the CFD simulation is used as training data set. The parametersθ^ OE are determined such that the dif- ference of the model output θ[] ( )g k defined in Eq.(7) and of the measured CFD output [ ]g k CFD is minimized in the following sense: ∑θθ^ = [ ]( [ ]( ) − [ ]) ()θ wk gk g kargmin. 8 k OE CFD This least square optimization is weighted by a weighting function[ ]wk. As long as the SPL does not vary in the training data set – which is the case in this section– the weights are set to[] ≡wk 1. This ansatz to predict the free model parameters is called the prediction error method (PEM), see Tangirala. The above optimization problem (8) is nonlinear and, thus, cannot be solved directly. There are several algorithms available to solve this problem, see e.g. the textbook by Keesman. Here, an iterative approach is presented, where the input and output data is pre-filtered such that white noise is realized in the end. This procedure, although well-known, is presented here since it is helpful to construct the optimization procedure for the nonlinear model proposed in Section 4.04. The nonlinear optimization problem can be written in a pseudo linear way: Φθ^ = ^ ()g W, 91/2 OE OE Fig. 4.

The model with colored noise is, in fact, autoregressive with exogenous terms (ARX). It has been observed that this ARX model shows inferior quality as the output-error model for the considered problem, especially for low frequencies. This colored noise can be overcome to obtain the output-error model when input and output are pre-filtered with ( )Fq 1/ as shown below. The considerations above lead to the following iterative procedure to determineθ^ OE correctly, cf. [34, Chp. 6.01.04]: The vector of unknowns is initialized with zeros, i.e.θ = 0 OE 0.

Linear system identification It has been remarked above that Helmholtz resonators can be linearly characterized with a second-order output-error model. Here, a time series with length 0.01 s and an incident SPL of 75 d B are used for the CFD simulations for all four test cases. The estimated reflection coefficients are presented in Fig. 5.I n Fig. 6, the corresponding normalized impedance is shown for HR 1. In those figures, also the empirical data from Hersh et al and Temiz are included. Good agreement can be seen for all test cases. 3.03. Uncertainty and Ill-conditioned transformation to resistance The SI process is always linked to some uncertainty in the estimated model parameters. This uncertainty can be de- termined using statistic techniques under the assumption the original system has the same structure as the model system. With this assumption and = −W 1 Kn b, the covariance matrix in the estimated parameters θ^Cov OE is given as: ()θσ Φ Φ^ = () − Cov, 15 e T OE OE OE where se denotes the empirical standard deviation of the noise[ ]ek. This uncertainty in the model parameter manifests itself in confidence intervals of the reflection behavior. In Fig. 5, the one (68.027%) and two standard deviation (95.045%) confidence intervals are shown for gain and phase of the reflection coefficient R estimated by an output-error model trained on a 0.01 s time series in the linear regime. This 0.01 s time series is K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190176 Reproduction of Papers sufficient to estimate the model parameters with high accuracy. For the gain||R, the confidence interval can be visually detected even though they are quite small. The intervals in the phase curve can hardly be seen. The estimated reflection behavior and its uncertainties can be propagated in an impedance representation and are shown in Fig. 6. For clarity, this is only presented for HR 1. The uncertainties are propagated by Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 random experiments. Here, many models are considered with random model parameters set according to the dis- tribution given by the covariance in Eq. (15). These models are transformed to the impedance and, then, the confidence intervals are defined by the corresponding quantiles. In the impedance representation, the impact of the uncertainty rises. The resistance R( )z is determined with narrow uncertainty bounds only in the vicinity of the resonator eigenfrequency. Apart from that frequency, the resistance is associated with high uncertainty. This behavior arises from the ill-conditioned transformation RR() = [ ( + ) ( − ) ]z R R 1/ 1 whenever RI() < <| ( ) |zz. This ill-conditioned transformation does not only influence the numerical setup, but also experiments with resonance tubes, where also the reflection coefficient R is determined and the impedancez is deduced from it. Due to this ill-conditioned transformation, the following discussions concentrate on the reflection coefficient R. 3.04. Local-linear identification on specified amplitude levels In the identification process, a linear model is estimated that provides the best fit for the training data. This model can be considered as a linearization of the actual nonlinear behavior around the current working condition. If the operating conditions in the training data sets differ, so do the estimated linear models. Different amplitude levels can be considered as different working condition, as seen in Eq. (5), where the amplitude shows up explicitly. Based on that idea, a series of linear models is estimated using data sets generated with an incident SPL of 75, 120, 130, and 140 d B, respectively. The corre- sponding reflection coefficients are plotted in Fig. 7. It can be seen that those models depict the trends expected for a correct representation of the nonlinear behavior: With rising SPL, the resistance also increases and, consequently, the minimal gain Fig. 6. SI-estimated ( ) and measured ( ) z with 1 and 2 standard deviation confidence intervals for test cases HR 4. Fig. 5. SI-estimated ( ) and measured (/C 2 ) reflection coefficient R with 1 and 2 standard deviation confidence intervals for test cases HR 1 (), HR 2 ( ), HR 3 ( ), and HR 4 ( ). K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190 177 A.6 Nonlinear Aeroacoustic Characterization of Helmholtz Reso nators with a Local-Linear Neuro-Fuzzy Model of the reflection coefficient drops. When the over-damped regime is reached, the maximal absorption decreases again, while the frequency bandwidth of high absorption gets wider. All estimated models are in phase (0 or multiples of π2 ) for fre- quencies far away from the eigenfrequency. Close to the eigenfrequency, the normally damped systems are in antiphase, while the over-damped system is in phase. Nevertheless, these local-linear models cannot predict the response to a dynamic time signal, since they are only valid close to the working conditions used within their estimation process. On the one hand, it is hard to judge whether the operating conditions for two differed signals agree. On the other hand, the condition can change during operation which can impossibly be reflected with a linear model. These drawbacks are remedied in the local-linear neuro-fuzzy model proposed in the following section. 4. Nonlinear system identification using a local-linear neuro-fuzzy model As seen in the previous section, linear models can describe the resonator behavior also at large oscillation amplitudes in a local-linear manner. The proposed model exploits this idea and combines such local-linear submodels to a nonlinear model in the time domain. This is done with a so-called neuro-fuzzy network model structure. The proposed model consists of a neuron layer and a second layer containing the linear submodels. The neuron layer distributes the input signal with respect to so-called membership functions over the second layer. Since every submodel behaves local-linearly, the model is denoted as local-linear neuro-fuzzy networks (LLNFN) in the following. Before results and validations for several test cases are presented in Section 5, the model is discussed in depth: First, the model is defined in Section 4.01 and the fuzzy membership functions being applied in the neuron layer are introduced in Section 4.02. An optimization problem for the parameter estimation is formulated in Section 4.03 and an iterative procedure to solve this problem is derived in Section 4.04. 4.01. Model structure The proposed model combines N output-error submodels OE θ( )ii in a network as sketched in Fig. 8. Each linear submodel is able to describe the resonator behavior in certain amplitude ranges adequately (see Section 3.04). The free model para- meters of theith submodel are denoted byθi and the overall free parameters are collected in the vector()θθ θ θ=…, N T 12. The linear submodels are wired via a neuron layer. Each subsystemi has its own neuron applying a so-called membership Fig. 7.

Block diagram of the local-linear neuro-fuzzy model. K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190178 Reproduction of Papers function μ [ ]ki, =…i N 1, 2, The overall model response[ ]g k is given as a linear combination of responses of the individual linear submodels: ∑θμ θ θ[] () = [] () ( ) () ( ) [] + [] ()= gk k Bq Fq fk ek. 16 i N i i i 1 For every instant in timek, each membership functionμi maps to a value in the interval[]0, 1, where 0 means that theith submodel is not member of the current state (false) while 1 means the opposite (true). However, in fuzzy logic, there exists not solely the true (1) and false (0) state as in the Boolean logic but also every intermediate state. Overall, the membership functions are set in such a way that the total operating conditions are gradually distributed among the different sub- conditions, i.e. μ∑ [] == k 1 i N i 1 for allk. The actual design of the membership functions is presented in the following section, a common-sense interpretation of the role of the membership function is developed as follows (for N ¼ 3): If the amplitudes are low, the first model OE 1 is taken to describe the resonator behavior. The second model OE 2 is considered in the medium amplitude regime and model OE 3 in the high-amplitude regime. This decision is made not in a strict but in a fuzzy way, which means that the response can be formed proportionally by more than one model OEi. For instance, a linear combi- nation of OE 1 and OE 2 is used in the low-medium amplitude regime. 4.02. Fuzzy membership functions A key point of the proposed model is the design of membership functions for the fuzzy neuron layer. This design is made a priori and is not included in the training process itself, as it is often done for other systems. By doing so, the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently in an iteration of linear least square problems as shown below. Nevertheless, the N estimated linear subsystems OE θ( )ii depend on the actual choice of the membership functions. In the optimization process, these subsystems are determined such that the interconnected network minimizes the objective function for the current set of membership functions. Since the rms of the velocity at the resonator surface xref is a reasonable measurement for the nonlinearity as discussed in Section 2.01, the membership functions are based on this value. By doing so, the membership functions are in principle capable of reflecting nonlinear effects due to a rising amplitude at a certain frequency as well as due to some non-harmonic effects. For that purpose, a sliding windowed rms of the (estimated) velocity is calculated [ ] = ( [− ] [− + ] … [− ] ) ()u k uk k uk k ukrms, 1, 1. 17 TTrms The window lengthk T is set such that it covers at least one eigenfrequency periodf 1/ eig. Note that the velocity[ ]uk is not directly available. During the identification process, it is just given by the difference of the inputf CFD and output data g CFD as [] = [] − [ ]uk f k g k CFD CFD. When an estimated model is simulated with an inputfinput, the velocity is estimated using the predicted response gmodel: [] = [] − [ ]uk f k g kinput model. For HR 1 excited with the input signal presented in Fig. 9, the sliding windowed rms value of the velocity is exemplarily plotted in Fig. 10. The input signal in Fig. 9 is set as described in Section 2.02. The membership functions are realized as hat functions, which are called Takagi-Sugeno membership functions in this context. Having set N reference velocitiesu iref, the membership functionsμ [ ]ki are defined (for [] ∈ [ ]uk u u, Nrms ref,1 ref, ) as: Fig. 9. Broadband excitation signals ramped up from incident SPL of 75–150 d B. K. Förner, W.

The intermediate states are defined by the relative distance of the current rms velocity [ ]ukrms to the neighboring reference velocities. The bounding membership functionsμ [ ]k 1 and μ [ ]k N take the value true (1) if the amplitude [ ]ukrms is below or above their reference values, respectively. A possible set of five membership functionsμi is plotted againsturms in Fig. 11. The following points should be considered for setting the reference velocitiesu iref, : The lowest reference velocityuref,1 has to be located clearly in the linear regime, while the highest velocityu Nref, marks the maximal rms velocity for which the estimated model will saturate by design. The remaining reference velocitiesu iref, ( =… − )i N 2, 3, 1 are located in between. They are not arranged in an equidistant manner, since the system dynamics changes most prominently in the transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime, such that more reference velocities should be located in this region. A grading has been applied to set the intermediate references for that purpose, i.e. Δ(−) ( − ) =++ +uu uu /ii iiref, 2 ref, 1 ref, 1 ref, For the results presented in Section 5, the grading factorΔ has been set to 4, the first reference velocity has been selected as zero=u 0 ref,1 [m/s] and the highest as 80% of the maximal velocity rms value in the training data set=( [ ])uu k 0.08 max Nref, rms. According to these rules, the five reference velocities for the membership functions shown in Fig. 11 have been set. Applying these Fig. 10. Root mean square of ′u for HR 1.

Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190180 Reproduction of Papers membership functions on the velocityurms shown in Fig. 10 yields the distribution ofμi over time presented in Fig. 12. It can be seen that the membership functions detect well the different levels of fluctuating velocities caused by the variation in the inputf signal. 4.03. Global and multi-objective optimization problem After the model structure is fixed, the set of unknown optimal parameters ()θθ θ θ^ = ^^ … ^, N T 12 has to be determined. For that purpose, an optimization in the unknowns is formulated. A procedure to solve this nonlinear optimization is shown in the next section ( Section 4.04). Following the PEM ansatz, the global difference between the model response θ[] ( )g k of Eq. (16) and the CFD measured response [ ]g k CFD shall be minimized. The corresponding global objective function reads as: ∑θθ^ =[ ] ( [ ]( ) − [ ]) ()θ wk gk g kargmin. 19 k CFD Since the amplitudes in the nonlinear regime can differ by several orders of magnitudes, an adaptive weighting[] ≠wk const. is applied. This weighting emphasizes the time instances with low amplitudes in comparison to those with high amplitudes. Without such a weighting, the time instances with high amplitudes would dominate in the optimization, while the in- stances with low amplitudes would have almost no influence on the optimization result and, accordingly, the estimated model would perform poorly at low amplitudes. Here, the inverse of a squared sliding windowed rms of the input signal is used, i.e. [] = ( [ − ] [ − + ]… [] )w k fk k fk k fk 1/rms, 1, TT 2. The window lengthk T is set such that the rms window covers at least one eigenfrequency period f 1/ eig. Formulating the optimization problem only in the global manner shown above may lead to a nonlinear model with poor local behavior. For instance, the descending function of the estimated reflection coefficient R can show unphysical char- acteristics for some amplitudes. This effect is well known in the modeling with neuro-fuzzy networks, see, e.g. Babuška and Verbruggen. A way to overcome this is to formulate local optimization problems for each submodeli: ∑θμ ζ θ μ^ = ( [] − ) [] ( [] ( ) − [] [] ) ()θ Hk w k g k k g kargmin. i k ii i i CFD i Above, the model output of theith submodel is denoted bygi. The function H and the parameterζ denote the Heaviside function and a threshold when the subproblem is active, respectively. So,μζ([ ] − )Hk i equals zero wheneverμ ζ[] <ki and it equals unity otherwise. A thresholdζ = 0.05 has been used for the results presented below Considering only the local op- timization problems (20) would lead to a nonlinear model behaving well locally which, however, might perform sub- optimally on a global scale. By formulating a multi-objective optimization problem, the advantages of both the global and the local ansatz can be combined, see Babuška and Verbruggen. The multi-object function is received by a combination of the global and the local objective functions. For the problem considered here, it reads ∑∑θθ δ μ ζ θ μ^ = []([] () − [] ) + ( [] − ) ( [] ( ) − [] [] ) ()θ = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟wk gk g k H k g k k g kargmin. 21 ki N i ii i i CFD CFD Fig. 12.

Parameter estimation procedure The nonlinear optimization problem(21) can be solved iteratively in a fashion similar to the one of the output-error model presented in Section 3.01. Note that this kind of problem is often solved via so-called instrumental variables methods, see, e.g. the textbook by Nelles. However, an implementation based on such a method did not show good convergence for CFD data of the Helmholtz resonator. That is why an implementation based on pre-filtering is introduced here. For clarity, this is presented only for the global optimization. When the local problems are included, the dimension on the optimization has to be extended accordingly. The vector of unknowns is initialized with zeros θ = 00 for l ¼ 0 and, then, the iteration=…l 1, 2, is started: First, the input f and measured outputg CFD are filtered to gain a white noise error: ∑∑μ θ μ θ [] = [] () ( ) [] [] = [] () ( ) [] ()= − = −fk k Fq fk g k k Fq gk 1 and 1. l i N i i l l i N i i l 1 CFD With these filtered quantities, the overall observation matrixΦΦ=( )fg,ll l for the iteration stepl is created. This overall observation matrix is constructed as a concatenation of the fuzzy-weighted output-error observation matricesμ Φi OE: ()Φμ Φ μ Φ μ Φ=( )( ) … ( ) ()fg fg fg, 24 ll l l l N ll 1 OE 2 OE OE Now, the unknowns can be updated: ()θΦ= () † g. 25 ll W l This procedure is repeated until convergence inθl is reached, which is usually after a few iterations. Several setting of the model, as for instance the number of chosen submodels N, are determined before the identification process and, of course, influence the identification results. Potentially, the identified results differ from each other strongly such that a judgment on the model goodness is difficult, see Jaensch and Polifke who applied SI based on artificial neural networks to characterized the acoustic flame response. The proposed model behave relatively robust regarding this issue, as shown in Appendix A. 5. Results and validation In this section, LLNFN models proposed in Section 4 are estimated for the four test cases considered. For each test case, the same model structure is used, and the same input signal is applied in the CFD simulations. The input signal plotted in Fig. 9 is a ramped broadband signal up to a certain cut-off frequency and is constructed as explained in Section 2.02. These estimated models are validated and evaluated in both time (Section 5.01) and frequency domain (Section 5.02). Finally in Section 5.03, the flexibility of the LLNFN model is discussed briefly. 5.01. Validation and evaluation in time domain The response of the estimated models is computed for a second independent input signal, which was not used to train the model. The validation against“test data”, is an important step in the SI, which ensure that estimated models do not suffer from over-parameterization. A model is denoted as over-parameterized when it has so many free parameters that it can, on the one hand, achieve a good fit to the training data due to the large degrees of freedom, but gives, on the other hand, poor predictions for another set of input data [34, p. 133]. For that purpose, a second random input signal is generated (see) which has the same power spectrum but is statis- tically independent of the training signal, i.e. the cross-correlation between those signals is low. Boththe training and the independent input signal are ramped up in the same manner. A common criterion to evaluate the similarity of two time signals g CFD and gmodel is the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). Since the mean value ofg CFD equals zeros, it reads as: K. Förner, W. Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190182 Reproduction of Papers =− − () gg g NRMSE 1. CFD model 2 CFD 2 NRMSE takes the value of unity for a perfect fit. It gives the value zero when a time series is compared against the zero sequence and can be−∞ in the worst case. However, this measure is not suitable in the considered cases since the time series contain sections where the fluctuation amplitudes differ by several orders of magnitudes from each other. Consequently,the NRMSE detects mainly the differences for high amplitudes and almost ignores those in the low amplitude range. To getan equal weighting for all amplitude ranges, both time series are scaled with the inverse of an moving rms ofg CFD: ˜ [] = ([ − ] … [ ] ) [] () gk gk k gk gk 1 rms, and 27 t CFD CFD CFD CFD ˜ [] = ([ − ] … [ ] ) [] () gk gk k gk gk 1 rms, 28 t model CFD CFD model The NRMSE based on those scaled quantities is a suitable measure for the considered time series. This is denoted as relative NRMSE in the following. The relative NRMSE is listed in Table 2 for all test cases considering different models. It is computed for both the training data and a second independent data set. The estimated local-linear neuro-fuzzy networks are referred to as LLNFNs. Moreover, the relative NRMSE values are given for a linear output-error model OEwhole estimated based on the whole training data. A second output-error model OElin estimated based on the linear regime of the training data is also included. Finally, an acoustically hard wall (R ¼ 1) is considered in this table to allow for a more intuitive interpretation of the fit values. It can be seen that none of the listed models is over-parameterized, since the relative NRMSE values are equally good for the training and the independent data set. As expected, the hard wall performs worst. However, it exhibits still rea- sonable fit values, since the resonator behaves like a hard wall for frequencies away from its eigenfrequency. Especially for HR 4 having a relatively narrow bandwidth, the NRMSE value are not bad for the hard wall case. Due to that narrow bandwidth of HR 4, all models perform best for this test case. The two output-error models OElin and OEwhole behave much better than the hard wall, since they consider damping at the eigenfrequency. However, they cannot account for the am- plitude-dependent damping behavior, since they are linear models. In acoustical CFD simulations, linear models tuned to a certain SPL are commonly used as boundary conditions. These two linear models illustrate the error that can occur if the tuning is either inadequate for current constant operating conditions, or cannot be good due to changing operating con- ditions. The LLNFN model has been constructed such that it can adapt to changing amplitudes and, accordingly, it also shows the best fit to the CFD data. This freedom is gained by an increase of the number of free parameters to N 5 (N ¼ 5 here) in comparison to 5 for the output-error models. Compared to other nonlinear models, like artificial neural networks, this number is still moderate. As mentioned above, it can clearly be observed that this model is not over-parameterized. For HR 3 and HR 4, the LLNFN model shows even a slightly better fit on the independent data than on the training data set. 5.02. Validation and evaluation in frequency domain The validation of the estimated LLNFN models against measurements is performed in frequency domain, since measure- ments are only given this way. Moreover, this allows for a physical interpretation of the behavior of the estimated nonlinear models. Since the LLNFN models are defined in the time domain, their frequency response is evaluated by harmonic excitation of the model. Before the discrete Fourier transformation is performed on the input and the output data of the model, thetime series are truncated to get rid of the transient behavior and to get a signal length which isa multiple of the excitation period. By doing so, leakage in the discrete Fourier transformation is avoided. This procedure requires low computational effort because both the evaluation of the model and the output post-processing can be performed very efficiently. The model response is validated against impedance describing functions from experiment. Note that these functions are usually given in the literature with respect to the total SPL. For the comparison the incident SPL to the model is varied Table 2 Relative NRMSE values for the four test cases.

Test cases HR 1 to HR 3 are compared against measurements from Hersh et al and HR 4 against measurements from Temiz. In this section, only the plots of HR 1 are presented to keep the paper compact. The figures for the three other test cases are shown in Appendix B. Fig. 13 shows the impedance describing function of the estimated LLNFN model for the linear regime (75 d B) and three SPLs (120 d B, 130 d B, and 140 d B) located in the nonlinear regime. The same information in the impedance perspective is depicted in Fig. 14. For the interpretation of the resistance plot on the left-hand side of Fig. 14, it should be kept in mind that the transformation from reflection coefficient to resistance is ill-conditioned apart from the eigenfrequency as shown in Section 3.03. Thus, the resistance plot is most meaningful close to the resonator eigenfrequency and loses significance apart from it. It can be seen that the LLNFN model reflects well the general nonlinear change of the reflection coefficient. With rising amplitude, the gain of the reflection coefficient drops down until the resonator is over-damped. In the over-damped regime, the maximal absorption rises again with increasing amplitude, and simultaneously the bandwidth gets wider. Moreover, the eigenfrequency shifts to higher frequencies. In the linear regime, the model and the measurements agree well. A closer look at the nonlinear regime exposes some discrepancies between the estimated LLNFN model and the measurements. The LLNFN model predicts the eigenfrequency shift already for lower amplitudes than it occurs in experi- ments. Moreover, the nonlinear resistance is under-predicted by the LLNFN model. These systematic discrepancies are present for all four test cases, but they are strongest for HR 1. Only for HR 4, the LLNFN model does not over-predict the nonlinear resistance. For this test case, the simulation over-predicts the resistance, see Förner et al, and the maximal SPL is lower than in the other test cases. The largest discrepancies occur for the test case HR 1 presented in this section. They are smaller for the other cases as seen in Figs. B.1–B.3. Overall, the agreement is reasonably good for all test cases. It can be concluded that the LLNFN model provides a reasonable and robust methodology to describe the nonlinear behavior of Helmholtz resonators. Fig. 13.

Polifke / Journal of Sound and Vibration 407 170–190184 Reproduction of Papers 5.03. Flexibility and practicability of the LLNFN model The LLNFN model cannot only reproduce measurements, but it can simulate reasonably well the response to any input signal up to the maximal amplitude that it has been trained for.Fig. 15 depicts the impedance describing function for total SPL ranging from 80 d B to 140 d B in steps of 5 d B. It can be seen that the impedance changes smoothly with SPL andfrequency, which makes this model attractive to serve as boundary condition in CFD or CAA simulations, where acoustic boundaries are involved. Using a linear model instead would require that this model be adapted a priori to the conditions and a linear model can never reflect changing conditions by definition. Moreover, the LLNFN model structure, which consists of several parallel linear sub- models, makes a model once estimated readily available also for other time steps or in Laplace space. Each submodel can be converted to a function in the Laplace variables by the Tustin transformation/uni 2192 zs. By another reverse transformation/uni 2192 s z, the estimated model can be applied for any fixed time step. Alternatively, the boundary condition can directly operate with the model representation in Laplace space, which has the advantage that the time step can vary within the simulation. Such possibilities are in general not given by other nonlinear models applied in SI, e.g. by artificialneural networks. Moreover, the provided procedure canbe used for the design of future resonators. When the designer has access to a validated CFD setup for resonator simulations, he/she can rapidly get a reasonable idea how geometrical, flow, or temperature conditions influence the linear and nonlinear resonator behavior, since only one CFD simulation is required. Thus, this procedure can also be used for the uncertainty quantification of the resonator response. It is known that, for instance, the manufacturing process of acoustic liners strongly impacts the actual damping behavior, see Murray et al. With the proposed method, one could quantify with low computational effort how the manufacturingtolerances influence the achieved damping performance. 6. Conclusions The paper proposes a local-linear neuro-fuzzy network to model the nonlinear resonator response in time domain. The free model parameters are determined via the CFD/SI approach, generated from time series data of a single CFD simulation. The nonlinear model consists of several linear submodels wired via fuzzy neurons in a network. It is shown thatsuch linear models can describe the resonator behavior also in the nonlinear regime in a local-linear manner. This means that such a local-linear model is only valid in the amplitude regime it is has been trained. The fuzzy-neuron layer distributes an input signal over several linear submodels based on the rms of the particle surface velocity. By doing so, the interconnected nonlinear model is capable of describing the nonlinear behavior over a wide amplitude range. A multi-objective optimization problem is for- mulated and an iterative procedure for its solution is derived. Within this iterative procedure, the input and output time series are pre-filtered to achieve an unbiased model. The model structureis robust against over-parameterization, since the estimated models behave comparably well on training data and on independent test data. The estimated models are validated via de- scribing functions for the reflection coefficient and the impedance against measurements from the literature for several test cases. Apart from slight deviations in the very high amplitude range, the estimated models perform very wellfor all test cases considered. It can be concluded that the proposed procedure offers a possibility to characterize the nonlinear resonator re- sponse over a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes with low computational effort. Such estimated data-based ROMs can serve as boundary conditions in compressible flow or acoustic simulations to correctly capture the nonlinear effects of a resonator or liner with marginal extra numerical costs. The efficient and robust nonlinear characterization makes this approach also feasible to support the resonator design in an early stage of development. Fig. 15.

The authors thank their colleagues Armin Witte and Stefan Jaensch for the fruitful discussion and M.A. Temiz from TU Eindhoven for providing measurement data for test case HR 4. Appendix A. Robustness of the LLNFN model The model structure has to be defined a priori. If the model structure does not correspond well to the system behavior, no good estimated models can be achieved in the end. In this section, the sensitivity of the estimated model behavior on the model structure is evaluated with respect to the number of submodels N considered. In Fig. A.1, reflection coefficients are plotted for incident SPLs of 75, 110, 120, 130, and 140 d B for estimated LLNFN models with N varying from 3 to 7. It can be observed that the curves of the different models coincide relatively well with the exception N ¼ 3. The curves of this outlier model (N ¼ 3) are plotted with dashed lines. Moreover, it can be seen that the coincidence is better in the high than in the lower amplitude regime. Overall, it can be concluded that the LLNFN model structure is relatively robust against changes in Nexcept when very few subsystems are incorporated. This robustness is also found (not shown here) with respect to other parameters as the grading to locate the reference velocities Δ and the weights of the local optimization problemsδi. The identification only fails if the reference velocitiesu iref, are arranged such that one or more submodels are“blocked”. Blocked means that almost no training data reaches this submodel which leads to an ill-conditioned optimization process. However, this can be detected easily by the user and another distribution of the reference velocities u iref, can be chosen. Appendix B. Graphs for test cases HR 2, HR 3, and HR 4 In this section, the graphs for the test case HR 2, HR 3, and HR 4 are provided. For each test case, the graphs are assembled in one figure. Subfigure (a) contains the reflection coefficient for the estimated LLNFN models and from experiment. Subfigure (b) shows the corresponding impedance. For HR 2 and HR 3, the experimental data is taken from Hersh et al for total SPLs of 75 d B (), 120 d B (), 130 d B (), and 140 d B (). The empirical data for HR 4 have been provided by Temiz 2 in a setup as in. The measurements have been adjusted such that the voltage at the microphone closest to the sample has been set to a fixed value. Dependent on the frequency, this results in total SPLs at the sample from (89.08–95.04) d B ( ), (119.05–121.08) d B (), and (125.07–127.07) d B (). The evaluation of the model was adjusted to these values with interpolation for the intermediate points. Subfigure (d) shows the estimated impedance describing function from a SPL ranging from 80 d B (bluish) to 140 d B (reddish) in steps of 5 d B ( Figs. B.1–B.3).

V orsitzender: Prof. Dr. Steffen Marburg Prüfer der Dissertation: Prof. Wolfgang Polifke, Ph.D. Prof. Dr. Kilian Oberleithner Die Dissertation wurde am 23.003.02021 bei der Technischen Universität München eingereicht und durch die TUM School of Engineering and Design am 14.009.02021 angenommen. ii Abstract This thesis is aimed at expanding the linear thermoacoustic modeling spectrum, especially by models that account not only for acoustic, but also convective waves, as well as interactions bet- ween the mean ﬂow and the perturbations. The most advanced models derived in this work even account for locally linearized reaction mechanisms, thus yielding more accurate predictions of combustion instabilities than previous state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to new conceptual approaches, the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method is applied for the ﬁrst time in linear thermoacoustic modeling. This numerical ansatz unites several desirable features, which include robust and ﬂexible ﬂux discretization, physically motivated stabilization by means of upwinding and straight forward adaptability to higher order basis functions. The spatially discretized models emerging from this special Finite Element Method can be cast in state-space form, which is a generalized representation for linear, time-invariant ﬁrst order differential equations. The state-space framework allows the interconnection of multiple (thermo-)acoustic models stemming from different sources and employing different assumpti- ons. Thus, it is possible to couple one dimensional network models, which account only for acoustic waves, to geometrically complex three dimensional models, which include beyond acoustics also vortical as well as entropic perturbations. This divide et imperaapproach facili- tates highly accurate modeling strategies where necessary (e.g. in the vicinity of the ﬂame) and reduced order modeling where possible (e.g. in regions where the ﬂow is predominantly axial). The methodology suggested in this thesis is shown to predict thermoacoustic eigenmodes with increased accuracy compared to modeling strategies that employ stronger simpliﬁcations, albeit the computational cost is very low compared to high ﬁdelity methods such as reacting Large Eddy Simulation. For laminar ﬂames, the ﬂame response to acoustic forcing is derived with high accuracy in a fraction of the time that would be required for state-of-the-art approaches employing broadband forcing of non-linear reacting ﬂow simulations coupled to system identi- ﬁcation. This is extremely appealing, as the determination of the ﬂame dynamics is by far the most costly aspect of numerical thermoacoustic stability analysis. The presented methodology thus supports fast and predictive assessment of operational stability in the design phase of gas turbines. iii Abstract iv Kurzfassung Die vorliegende Arbeit zielt darauf ab, das Spektrum der Modellierungsansätze in der Ther- moakustik zu erweitern, insbesondere um Modelle, die nicht nur akustische, sondern auch kon- vektive Wellenarten, sowie deren Interaktion mit dem mittleren Strömungsfeld berücksichtigen. Die am weitesten entwickelten Modelle in dieser Arbeit betrachten hierzu sogar örtlich aufge- löste linearisierte Reaktionschemie, was genauere V orhersagen von Verbrennungsinstabilitäten erlaubt als Ansätze gemäß dem vorherigen Stand der Technik. Zusätzlich zu den neuen Modellierungsansätzen wird erstmals die Discontinuous Galerkin Fi- nite Elemente Methode in linearen thermoakustischen Modellen verwendet. Dieser numerische Ansatz vereint einige wünschenswerte Eigenschaften, wie zum Beispiel die robuste und ﬂexible Diskretisierung numerischer Flüsse, eine durch die Physik des Problems motiviert Stabilisie- rung des Verfahrens durch richtungsabhängige Schemata, sowie die einfache Erweiterbarkeit hin zu Ansatzfunktionen höherer Ordnung. Die örtlich diskretisierten Modelle, die durch diese spezielle Finite Elemente Methode ent- stehen, können im Zustandsraum formuliert werden, was eine generalisierte Darstellungswei- se für lineare, zeitinvariante Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung ist. Die Zustandsraum- darstellung ermöglicht die Verbindung mehrerer (thermo-)akustischer Modelle verschiedenen Ursprungs, die auf unterschiedlichen Vereinfachungen basieren. So ist es möglich, eindimen- sionale Netzwerkmodelle, die nur akustische Wellen berücksichtigen, mit dreidimensionalen Modellen komplizierter Geometrien zu koppeln, die darüber hinaus auch Störungen in der Wir- belstärke und der Entropie auﬂösen. Diese divide et impera Herangehensweise ermöglicht den Einsatz präziser Modellierungsansätze, wo nötig (beispielsweise in Flammennähe), und von Modellen mit reduzierter Ordnung, wo möglich (beispielsweise in Regionen, in denen die Strö- mung hauptsächlich axial ist). Die Methodiken, die in der vorliegenden Arbeit vorgestellt werden, können thermoakustische Eigenmoden genauer vorhersagen als Modellierungsansätze die stärkere Vereinfachungen nut- zen, obwohl der Rechenaufwand im Vergleich zu hochaufgelösten Methoden wie der Large Eddy Simulation reagierender Strömungen sehr gering ist. Für laminare Flammen kann die Flammenantwort auf akustische Anregung mit hoher Präzision bestimmt werden, wobei die Laufzeit nur einen Bruchteil der Zeit beträgt, die der gängige Ansatz mit einer Kombinati- on aus breitbandiger Anregung einer nichtlinearen Verbrennungssimulation und anschließender Systemidentiﬁkation braucht. Das ist vor allem deshalb sehr attraktiv, da die Bestimmung der Flammendynamik der kostspieligste Aspekt der numerischen thermoakustischen Stabilitätsana- lyse ist. Die in dieser Arbeit vorgestellte Methodik ist deshalb gut für die schnelle und prädiktive Evaluierung der Betriebsstabilität von Gasturbinen im Entwicklungsstadium geeignet. v Kurzfassung vi Vorwort Die vorliegende Arbeit entstand während meiner Zeit als Lehrassistent an der Professur für Thermoﬂuiddynamik der Technischen Universität München. Ich möchte mich ganz herzlich bei meinem Doktorvater Wolfgang Polifke bedanken, der mir einerseits immer mit Rat und Tat zur Seite stand, mir andererseits aber auch sämtliche Freiheiten gab, meine Forschung selbst zu gestalten. Nur durch das Vertrauen, das er mir entgegengebracht hat, konnte sich die Arbeit the- matisch in diese Richtung entwickeln. Sein Mentorat wirkt jedoch deutlich über den fachlichen Bereich hinaus. Besonders mein V ortragsstil und die Art und Weise, Studierende zu betreuen, sind stark durch sein V orbild geprägt. Ihm ist es auch zu verdanken, dass am Institut eine lockere und dennoch produktive Stimmung herrscht. Die meisten der Ideen, die im Rahmen dieser Arbeit entstanden sind, wurden in enger Zusam- menarbeit mit Wolfgang Polifke und meinen Kollegen am Institut entwickelt. Obwohl es mir schwer fällt, einige meiner Mit-Doktoranden aus dieser wirklich großartigen Gruppe her- vorzuheben, möchte ich dennoch ein paar von ihnen persönlich erwähnen. Tobias Holzinger, Ralf Blumenthal und Thomas Steinbacher waren als Student meine ersten Kontakte zum Lehrstuhl im Praktikum Grundlagen numerischer Thermoﬂuiddynamik. Stefan Jaensch brachte mir die Grundzüge der Thermoakustik während meiner Semesterarbeit bei. Thomas Emmert be- treute nicht nur in geduldigster Weise meine Masterarbeit, sondern ermöglichte mir auch einen idealen Einstieg in die Gepﬂogenheiten als Doktorand. Darüber hinaus weiß ich nicht, wie oft ich die Frage „Wo kann man das denn nachlesen?“ eines Kollegen mit „Das hat mir Thomas damals am Whiteboard erklärt.“ beantwortet habe. Alexander Avdonin hatte die Idee des Lin- earized Reactive Flows, der die vorliegende Arbeit stark geprägt hat. Ohne seine motivierenden Worte hätte ich wohl nach Monaten vergeblicher Implementierungsversuche aufgegeben und mich der damals gängigen Meinung unter den Kollegen angeschlossen, dass linearisierte Ver- brennungschemie einfach nicht funktioniert. Mit Christian Lang durfte ich leider nur ein Jahr im Büro verbringen, an das ich mich aber immer gerne zurück erinnere. Unsere Diskussionen über die Navier-Stokes Gleichungen haben einen bleibenden Eindruck auf mein Verständnis der Fluidmechanik hinterlassen. Guillaume Fournier, mit dem ich in den letzten zwei Jahren das Büro teilte, war mir immer ein V orbild an Gewissenhaftigkeit und Durchhaltevermögen. Unsere Gespräche werden mir sehr fehlen. Moritz Merk, der nicht nur mein Forschungsthema, sondern auch meine Lehrtätigkeit als Assistent für die Wärmetransportphänomene weiterführt, hat mir vieles an Arbeit abgenommen und mich in der Entwicklung neuer Ideen unterstützt. Last but not least möchte ich mich noch bei Felix Schily und Simon van Buren bedanken, die während meiner Zeit am Institut nicht nur zu vertrauten Kollegen, sondern zu Freunden wurden. Ihre Hilfe in schwierigen Zeiten als Doktorand war unbezahlbar. Das wichtigste jedoch, was mich täglich antreibt, ist meine Familie. Ein herzliches Dankeschön vii Vorwort an meine Eltern und Großeltern, die mich während Studium und Promotion immer unterstützt haben, sich mit mir über Erfolge gefreut haben und mir in schweren Zeiten die Kraft gegeben haben, weiter zu machen. Die größte Unterstützung fand ich in meiner Frau Sabrina, sowie in meinen Söhnen Noah, Jakob und Linus. Ohne euch wäre diese Arbeit niemals entstanden, und euch im speziellen möchte ich sie widmen. viii Contents 1 Introduction 1 2 Governing Equations 3 2.01 Reactive Flow. 3 2.02 Linearized Reactive Flow. 4 2.02.01 Governing Equations. 4 2.02.02 Transformation to the Laplace Domain. 5 3 Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches 7 3.01 Scale Disparity in Thermoacoustic Models. 7 3.02 Hybrid Models. 7 3.02.01 Acoustic Models. 8 3.02.02 Flow-ﬂame Interaction Models. 10 3.02.03 Common Hybrid Modeling Approaches. 11 3.02.04 Disadvantages. 12 4 The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics 15 4.01 Fundamentals of the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method. 15 4.02 Comparison to other Numerical Methods. 17 4.03 Application to Thermoacoustics. 19 4.04 Diagonalization of the Non-Viscous Flux. 20 4.05 Implementation: felicita X. 21 4.05.01 Dogma and Fundamentals. 21 4.05.02 Usage Examples. 23 5 Modular Systems in the State-Space Framework 27 5.01 State-Space Systems. 27 5.01.01 Solution Procedures. 27 5.01.02 Interconnection of State-Space Systems. 28 5.02 Use Cases of State-Space Interconnect Models. 28 6 Contextualization and Discussion of Publications 31 7 Summary and Discussion of Papers 35 7.01 Linear State-Space Interconnect Modeling of Acoustic Systems. 36 7.02 Efﬁcient Calculation of Thermoacoustic Modes utilizing State-Space Models. 37 iii CONTENTS 7.03 A State-Space Formulation of a Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Thermoa- coustic Stability Analysis. 38 7.04 Determination of Acoustic Scattering Matrices from Linearized Compressible Flow Equations with Application to Thermoacoustic Stability Analysis. 39 7.05 Thermoacoustic Analysis of a Laminar Premixed Flame using a Linearized Re- active Flow Solver. 40 7.06 On the Spurious Entropy Generation Encountered in Hybrid Linear Thermoa- coustic Models. 41 8 Outlook 43 Bibliography 45 List of Figures 51 Supervised Students 53 Appendices 59 A.1 PAPER-CONNECT. 59 A.2 PAPER-EFFICIENT. 69 A.3 PAPER-SCATTERING. 77 A.4 PAPER-DGFEM. 104 A.5 PAPER-LRF. 125 A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY. 133 iv 1 Introduction The ecological challenge of the 21 st century is to meet the drastically growing need for electrical power, while reducing the generated emissions of the production. The long term solution, generation of electrical power from renewable resources such as wind and solar energy, comes with one signiﬁcant drawback: the unsteadiness in supply. To counterbalance the ﬂuctuating availability of electrical energy from renewable sources, gas turbines are commonly used as one of the more ecologically friendly conventional power sources. Beyond the importance during the transitional phase towards renewable energy sources, “power-to-gas“ technologies that store excess energy in chemical form rather than by means of batteries, can utilize gas turbines in the conversion process to electrical energy. Quick start-up times as well as a wide operational range are required to guarantee the ﬂexibility needed for the on-demand operation. Additionally, combustion is kept in the lean premixed regime to reduce pollutant emissions, which however makes the engines susceptible to thermoacoustic combustion instabilities [3–5]. Meeting the requirements for stable, ﬂexible and robust operation under aggravated conditions leads to a signiﬁcant increase in complexity during the design phase of gas turbines. The most challenging kind of combustion instabilities found in lean premixed gas turbines are thermoacoustic instabilities. These are based on a feedback loop between acoustic waves impinging on the ﬂame and unsteady combustion, which in turn generates acoustics, leading to oscillations possibly throughout the whole engine. When positive interference between the unsteady combustion and the acoustic waves at the ﬂame occurs, the amplitudes of these oscil- lations can grow in time and be detrimental to safe and efﬁcient operation of the machine. High pressure amplitudes can damage ﬁner structures of the engine and lead to increased noise emission. Additionally, the unsteady combustion has a negative inﬂuence on material wear as well as pollutants in the exhaust gas. In extreme cases, thermoacoustic instabilities lead to blow out, ﬂash back or even the destruction of the engine. Therefore, tools are required to predict combustion dynamics with high accuracy, but at afford- able cost, as early as possible in the design phase of a gas turbine. Lord Rayleigh was already aware of the interaction between acoustic waves and combustion in the 19 th century. The interest for technical applications grew in the 1950 s when rocket engines failed in spectacular manner due to thermoacoustic instabilities. The ﬁrst quantitative descriptions of the reaction of the perturbed combustion due to acoustic waves as well as the relation between the perturbed heat release rate and the generated acoustics were formulated. Today, a plethora of analytical as well as numerical models for the prediction of thermoacoustic instabilities are available, from inexpensive reduced order descriptions that rely heavily on simplifying assumptions to highly complex compressible reactive ﬂow solvers that require a super computer to run, but therefore include the interaction between acoustics, turbulence, species mixing and combustion kinetics, to name only a few. The focus of the work summarized in this publication-based thesis is the extension of the lin- Introduction ear thermoacoustic model spectrum in terms of introducing more detailed governing equations. Thus, the gap between linearized reduced order models, which often employ strong simpli- ﬁcations to the physics, and non-linear thermoacoustic modeling approaches based on more sophisticated governing equations, can be closed (compare e.g. Fig. 1 in ). The motiva- tion to account for the intricate interplay between ﬂow perturbations, acoustic waves and the unsteady combustion by making as few a priori assumptions as possible about the perturbed ﬂow is to increase the predictive quality of linear thermoacoustic methods. This is achieved by introducing the Linearized Reactive Flow (LRF), a modeling approach that takes into account not only perturbations of the ﬂow, but also in the species transport and the local combustion reaction rates. The main difference between the LRF and current state-of-the-art reduced order models is that it is not hybrid in nature, i.e. the reacting ﬂow is modeled as one monolithic system instead of the common divide et imperaapproach to represent the thermoacoustic system by connection of dedicated submodels for the ﬂow perturbations and the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction. Furthermore, the disadvantages of the hybrid modeling approach are investigated and it is shown that spurious entropy perturbations are produced if the coupling of the submodels does not account for ﬂame movement, which is a crucial property of every ﬂame. Beyond the linearized thermoacoustic modeling equations, their numerical treatment with a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method is introduced. It provides a robust ansatz with straight forward extensibility to higher order schemes to discretize the governing equations and thus the overall approach allows predictive thermoacoustic modeling. Beyond the scope of LRF, the presented numerical methodology is applied to hybrid models based on Linearized Navier- Stokes and Linearized Euler Equations. The purpose of this publication-based thesis is to give an overview of the fundamentals of thermoacoustic modeling with the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method and provide the context around and connections between the papers of this thesis. 2 Governing Equations Experimental investigation of gas turbines and rocket engines, including the required measure- ments to diagnose the occurring thermoacoustic instabilities, are prohibitively expensive and only possible after the initial design phase. The restricted access to quantities of interest via diagnostics additionally complicates the investigation of those instabilities by means of an ex- perimental setup. Therefore, numerical simulations are often employed to complement or even replace those setups. This chapter introduces the governing equations employed for those kinds of studies. 2.01 Reactive Flow The basis for the numerical tools in thermoacoustics are the governing equations for a reactive ﬂow, consisting of the Navier-Stokes Equations alongside the species transport equations. For combustion, the formulation of the energy equation in terms of total enthalpy is oftentimes favorable. Note that in the frame of this thesis work, viscous heating is neglected, because the Mach number in combustion chambers is typically small enough such that this effect has no major contribution to the energy balance. The term for the heat ﬂux caused by diffusion of species with different enthalpies is also ignored. ∂ρ ∂t + ∂ ∂xj ( ρuj ) = 0 (2.01) ∂ ∂t ( ρui ) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρui uj ) = −δi j ∂p ∂xj + ∂τi j ∂xj (2.02) ∂ ∂t ( ρht −p ) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρht uj ) = ∂ ∂xj ( λ ∂T ∂xj ) + ˙q V (2.03) ∂ ∂t ( ρYk ) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρYkuj ) = ∂ ∂xj ( Dk ∂Yk ∂xj ) + ˙ωk (2.04) Here, thermal and species diffusion is modeled by Fourier’s and Fick’s law, respectively. As- suming Stokes’ hypothesis and a Newtonian ﬂuid, the viscous stress tensor is given by τi j= µ (∂ui ∂xj + ∂uj ∂xi −δi j ∂uk ∂xk ), (2.05) and the relation between pressure, density and temperature can be modeled via the ideal gas law for the cases presented in this thesis. p = ρRT (2.06) The reaction rates that govern the volumetric heat release rate ˙q V and the production rate of species k, ˙ωk, are typically expressed as non-linear functions of the thermodynamic state vari- ables T, p,ρ as well as the species mass fractions Yk. Governing Equations 2.02 Linearized Reactive Flow Equations (2.01) - (2.04) can be solved numerically for laminar cases, together with a suitable chemical reaction model. For turbulent cases, it is common to employ ﬁltering techniques to avoid the resolution of small-scale turbulent structures. Two popular approaches employ tem- poral ﬁltering via Reynolds averaging (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes, RANS) or spatial ﬁltering (Large Eddy Simulation, LES) to these equations and subsequently solve them with similar approaches to a laminar ﬂow. Due to the non-linear nature of the governing equations, phenomena such as mode coupling, transfer of perturbation energy between different frequen- cies as well as the excitation of higher harmonic oscillations can be represented. Although these are effects that can appear in real thermoacoustic systems, and thus their nature needs to be studied, they complicate the identiﬁcation of the fundamental instability mechanisms. For ex- ample, the non-linear dynamics can obscure the presence of a second unstable thermoacoustic eigenmode, which is suppressed by a primary instability. Beyond the challenges in interpretation of results, non-linearity of the reactive ﬂow equations also restricts the solution algorithms predominantly to simulations in the time-domain. Com- pared to computations in the frequency domain as well as an eigenvalue analysis (both are methods that can be employed in a straight-forward manner for linear systems), time-domain simulations require signiﬁcant computational effort, provided the phenomenon under investiga- tion is inherently connected to (a superposition of) harmonic oscillations. Therefore, it is desir- able to broaden the variety of investigation methods by linearization of the governing equations, simultaneously eliminating non-linear thermoacoustic effects. This linearization, consequently, results in methods that can only predict the linear onset of combustion instabilities, and lack any information about their non-linear temporal evolution, e.g. the amplitude of limit-cycle oscillations. 2.02.01 Governing Equations A commonly made perturbation ansatz employed as a ﬁrst step towards linearization of the governing equations is the Reynolds decomposition, which splits the unknown variables Φ = (ρ,ui, p) in a steady-state mean ﬂow ¯Φ(x) and perturbations Φ′(x, t), Φ(x, t) = ¯Φ(x) +Φ′(x, t). (2.07) 2.02 Linearized Reactive Flow Inserting this ansatz into Eqs. (2.01)-(2.06) and neglecting non-linear terms, the Linearized Reac- tive Flow (LRF) equations can be obtained. ∂ρ′ ∂t + ∂ ∂xj ( ρ′ ¯uj + ¯ρu′ j ) = 0 (2.08) ∂ ∂t ( ρ′ ¯ui + ¯ρu′ i ) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρ′ ¯uj ¯ui + ¯ρu′ j ¯ui + ¯ρ ¯uj u′ i ) +δi j ∂p′ ∂xj = ∂τ′ i j ∂xj (2.09) ∂ ∂t ( ρ′ ¯h + ¯ρh′ −p′) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρ′ ¯h ¯uj + ¯ρh′ ¯uj + ¯ρ ¯hu′ j ) = ∂ ∂xj ( λ′ ∂ ¯T ∂xj + ¯λ∂T ′ ∂xj ) + ˙q′ V (2.010) ∂ ∂t ( ρ′ ¯Yk + ¯ρY ′ k ) + ∂ ∂xj ( ρ′ ¯Yk ¯uj + ¯ρY ′ k ¯uj + ¯ρ ¯Yku′ j ) = ∂ ∂xj ( D′ k ∂ ¯Yk ∂xj + ¯Dk ∂Y ′ k ∂xj ) + ˙ω′ k (2.011) τ′ i j= ¯µ ( ∂u′ i ∂xj + ∂u′ j ∂xi −δi j ∂u′ k ∂xk ) +µ′ (∂ ¯ui ∂xj + ∂ ¯uj ∂xi −δi j ∂ ¯uk ∂xk ) (2.012) T ′ ¯T = p′ ¯p − ρ′ ¯ρ (2.013) Expressions for the perturbations in material properties dynamic viscosity µ′, thermal conduc- tivity λ′ and species diffusivity D′ have to be provided additionally. The source terms˙q′ V and ˙ω′ k of the monolithic LRF approach depend on the unknown variables via a linearized combustion mechanism. Examples are the linearized one-step Westbrook and Dryer mechanism or the linearized two-step 2 S-CM 2 mechanism (both for methane-air combustion). As can be seen from Eq. (2.07), a steady-state mean ﬂow is required for the LRF. This steady state is usually computed from non-linear Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It should be noted that the computation of this steady-state takes only a fraction of the effort it would take to determine the thermoacoustic stability of a system purely via CFD. Thus, the LRF approach with comparatively small computational cost to solve for the linearized governing equations, has signiﬁcant cost advantages even after factoring in the effort to compute the mean ﬂow. For cases that are inherently unsteady, e.g. turbulent ﬂow, usage of a time-averaged, instead of a steady- state ﬂow ﬁeld was demonstrated to be viable [15–19]. This is important especially for reacting cases, as RANS, which produces steady-state solutions, as well as unsteady RANS, were shown to be incapable of reproducing accurately the ﬂame shape and dynamics. Solutions from LES, on the other hand, although capable of representing the ﬂame dynamics in good agreement to experimental observations, are inherently unsteady due to turbulent ﬂuctuations. 2.02.02 Transformation to the Laplace Domain The linearized governing equations given in this chapter are presented in the time-domain. In thermoacoustics, it is often advantageous to perform a space-time separation of the perturbed variables and to assume harmonic time dependence. Φ′(x, t) = ˆΦ(x)est (2.014) Governing Equations Here, s = σ+iω is the Laplace variable, used to represent a temporal oscillation with frequency ω and growth rate σ. ˆΦ(x) is the complex valued spatial distribution of the perturbation vari- able. Inserting this ansatz into one of the governing equations allows to determine the system’s response to external forcing in the linear regime for a given s. Alternatively, the computation of the eigenfrequencies and -modes of the system in the homogeneous case is possible. It is often preferred to investigate thermoacoustic systems in the Laplace instead of the time-domain because of the reduced computational effort and the clear separation between oscillation fre- quencies. 3 Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches This chapter introduces and motivates the concept of hybrid as opposed to monolithic linearized thermoacoustic models like the LRF. Both of these approaches, however, rely on non-linear computations to provide a steady-state mean-ﬂow as the basis for linearization, and are thus not a stand-alone approach for thermoacoustic stability analysis. 3.01 Scale Disparity in Thermoacoustic Models The physical mechanisms involved in thermoacoustic combustion instabilities happen on largely different scales: acoustic waves feature large spatial extent and propagate comparatively fast, with the speed of sound augmented by the mean ﬂow velocity. This fast propagation limits the time step size in numerical simulations, as typically the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number should stay below unity. The chemical reactions in the combustion zone are strongly im- pacted by the species and heat transport, which are diffusive processes that require high spatial resolution to be correctly represented. Additionally, the strong non-linear nature of the reac- tion mechanisms leads to a stiff system of equations, requiring iterative solution procedures. Convective waves are usually of intermediate spatial extent and propagate slower than acoustic waves. This disparity in scales, which is present in monolithic thermoacoustic models, leads to strong restrictions on the time step as well as the mesh size. As a result, the computational effort to deduce the ﬂame response to acoustic forcing from laminar CFD or LES in the time domain is very signiﬁcant. A strong gain in efﬁciency can be achieved by employing the LRF. Due to the linear nature, iterative solution procedures can be avoided and a transformation to the Laplace domain is possible. This allows to directly deduce the response of the system at a given complex frequency by solving only one system of linear equations. Note however, that the restrictions on mesh size are not alleviated by the LRF approach. The combustion zone as well as parts of the geometry that produce signiﬁcant hydrodynamic perturbations have to be highly resolved to correctly capture thermoacoustic instabilities. 3.02 Hybrid Models Due to the high computational demand of monolithic models, a common approach in thermoa- coustics is the use of hybrid models, in which the small and large scales of the problem are Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches treated separately. First, a non-linear CFD simulation is employed to determine the response of the ﬂame to acous- tic forcing. Because most often, the combustion zone is compact with regard to the acoustic wavelength, the correct propagation velocity of the acoustics is insigniﬁcant for the ﬂame re- sponse. Therefore, the assumption of a weakly compressible ﬂow is justiﬁed, which expresses density as a function of temperature, but not pressure. This alleviates the computational demand because the time-step size can be increased compared to a fully compressible approach. The ﬂow-ﬂame interaction model is determined via post-processing methods of the forced combus- tion simulation. Two commonly used approaches are Fourier transformation of a harmonically forced case, leading to a model that is only known at the discrete frequencies of forcing, and system identiﬁcation of a broadband forced case. The latter method is a form of regression anal- ysis, usually between the time series of the spatially integrated heat-release perturbation (output) and the velocity ﬂuctuations at a reference position (input), both induced by the forcing. This methodology requires only one simulation, as opposed to the necessity for an individual simu- lation for each forcing frequency in the Fourier transformation procedure. However, the quality of the model determined via system identiﬁcation is dependent on the parameters as well as the signal-to-noise ratio and the frequency content in the time series. In a second step, the ﬂow-ﬂame model is connected to a linear reduced order model for the propagation of acoustic and possibly also ﬂow perturbations, see Fig. 3.01. The solution of this connected hybrid model is orders of magnitudes cheaper than solving for a monolithic non- linear model, although the cost for determination of the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction model has to be factored in. ﬂow perturbations Acoustic submodel Flow-ﬂame interaction submodel at reference position heat release rate ﬂuctuations Figure 3.01: Connection of submodels in thermoacoustic hybrid approaches. 3.02.01 Acoustic Models The submodel governing the ﬂow perturbations in hybrid modeling can be derived by intro- ducing various simpliﬁcations to the LRF governing equations. Omitting the linearized species transport, Eq. (2.011), as well as the linearized reaction mechanism for the source terms from the LRF equations, the Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations (LNSE) are obtained. 3.02 Hybrid Models Further simplifying the LNSE by omission of the thermo-viscous terms, i.e. τ′ = λ′ = ¯λ = 0, yields the Linearized Euler Equations (LEE), which have seen frequent use in aero- but also thermoacoustics. The underlying reasoning is that viscous terms have little impact on large- scale acoustic waves. However, the damping due to unsteady boundary layers as well as the viscous dissipation of vortices in shear layers of the mean ﬂow can signiﬁcantly contribute to the perturbation ﬁeld, as shown by Meindl et al for the acoustic scattering behavior of swirl generators. Beyond this, the LEE can lead to inconsistencies with the mean ﬂow: the steady-state ﬂow ﬁelds are most often a solution of the Navier-Stokes Equations from laminar CFD, RANS or LES, which feature thermo-viscous effects. These inconsistencies are especially critical for the velocity boundary conditions on no-slip walls of the mean ﬂow ( ¯u = 0), as the LEE only allow for slip boundary conditions (u′·n = 0, where n is the boundary normal vector) due to the lack of viscous terms. Consequently, unphysical vortical perturbation structures can ensue in the boundary layers of the mean ﬂow, which pollute the solution and might even grow unstable. When zero mean velocities are assumed for the LEE, the wave equation can be obtained. The homogeneous wave equation can be derived from linearized mass and momentum equation. For inclusion of the source term due to heat release rate perturbations, as required in thermoa- coustics, the linearized energy instead of the mass conservation equation has to be used in the derivation. For this to work, we have to assume no mean heat release rate and constant speciﬁc heat capacities in the mean ﬂow. ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 − ¯pγ ∂ ∂xj (1 ¯ρ ∂p′ ∂xj ) = ( γ−1 )∂ ˙q′ V ∂t (3.01) Due to the zero mean velocity assumption, ¯p = const follows directly from the mean ﬂow mo- mentum conservation equation, as no viscous pressure losses occur. Thus, with c 2 = γ ¯p/ ¯ρ, the wave equation becomes (without any further assumptions): ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 − ∂ ∂xj ( c 2 ∂p′ ∂xj ) = ( γ−1 )∂ ˙q′ V ∂t (3.02) Under the assumption of isentropic perturbations, i.e. p′ = c 2ρ′, the wave equation with the c 2 term outside the spatial gradient can be derived. ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 −c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂x 2 j = ( γ−1 )∂ ˙q′ V ∂t (3.03) The homogeneous part of the wave equation is self-adjoint, as opposed to the LRF/LNSE/LEE. This is advantageous for the numerical treatment, as no stabilization terms for the discretization of the spatial gradients are required. Together with the reduced degrees of freedom following from only one scalar unknown, this makes the wave equation attractive for reduced order mod- eling in thermoacoustics. However, it should be noted that the assumption of zero heat release rate and constant heat capacities in the mean ﬂow, necessary to derive Eqs. (3.01) and (3.02), both strongly contradict the nature of reactive ﬂows. The simpliﬁcation towards Eq. (3.03) introduces an additional unjustiﬁed assumption, as perturbations only behave isentropically if there are no velocities and entropy gradients in the mean ﬂow, both of which are ubiquitous in combustion chambers. Thus, the use of the wave equation as shown in Eq. (3.03), but also Eq. (3.02), in ther- moacoustics comes with strong restrictions and one has to be aware of the modeling mistakes made when interpreting the results. Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches 3.02.02 Flow-ﬂame Interaction Models To account for the ﬂow-ﬂame coupling in hybrid models, the source term ˙q′ V (x, t) for the per- turbed heat release rate is governed by an external model, like a Flame Transfer Function (FTF) determined from CFD/LES and appropriate post-processing. The FTF F is a linear model con- necting ˙q′ V (x, t) to the time lagged axial velocity perturbations u′ ref(t − τ) normal to a plane located at a reference position xref. In the most general case, a local FTFFL is employed, which depends on both space x and complex frequency s. This relation is conveniently formulated in the Laplace domain as ˆ˙q V (x) ¯˙Q = FL(x, s) ˆuref ¯uref. (3.04) Here, the volume integral of the mean heat release rate, ¯˙Q = ∫ Ω ¯˙q V dx, as well as the mean velocity at the reference position, ¯uref, are used for normalization. For acoustically compact ﬂames, and in connection to governing equations that do not support entropy waves, the spatial distribution of the perturbed heat release rate can be neglected and a global FTF FG, which only depends on complex frequency s, can be employed. ˆ˙Q ¯˙Q = FG (s) ˆuref ¯uref (3.05) Note that ˆ˙Q = ∫ Ω ˆ˙q V dx. A comparison of the ensuing heat release rate perturbations for FL and FG connected to LNSE is shown in Fig. 3.02 for a duct ﬂame, which was investigated in. Figure 3.02: Instantaneous heat release rate perturbations of a 2 D duct ﬂame as governed by a fully local FTF (top) and a global FTF (bottom). Forced response at 400 Hz. The spatial distribution for the global FTF has been chosen proportional to the mean heat release rate and is in-phase along the length of the ﬂame due to the lack of knowledge about the spatial phase information. The identiﬁcation of FG, rather than FL, requires less sophisticated techniques and computa- tional effort. Thus, it is very common in thermoacoustics to employ a global FTF, if the system to be modeled permits this simpliﬁcation. For cases where the acoustic submodel does not sup- port entropy waves, but the ﬂame is not compact with regards to the acoustic waves traveling in axial direction, segmented FTFs FS were applied in several studies to correctly account for the correct phase and gain between the acoustics and the perturbed heat release rate [25–33]. A 3.02 Hybrid Models segmented FTF is only resolved in the axial direction (here assumed to be x 1). The perturbed heat release rate is either continuously axially distributed, or in a discrete manner by averag- ing over a sequence of contiguous sub-domains, which are small enough to assume acoustic compactness for each. ˆ˙q V (x 1) ¯˙Q = FS(x 1, s) ˆuref ¯uref (3.06) Beyond the scope of linear ﬂow-ﬂame models, non-linear models such as the Flame Describing Function (FDF) are employed to determine limit cycle amplitudes of thermoacoustic instabili- ties with hybrid models. Those, however, are out of the scope of this thesis. 3.02.03 Common Hybrid Modeling Approaches The various linear thermoacoustic models can be sorted by complexity. Higher complexity comes with a more detailed description of the system (usually by applying less simpliﬁcations to the governing equations), but at a higher computational cost. Therefore, a trade-off between accurate predictions and effort is the unavoidable result. LRF LNSE/LEE Helmholtz Network modelling assumptions cost and accuracy increase in increase in Figure 3.03: Hierarchical representation of the most common linear thermoacoustic modeling approaches. The following bullet points list some of the most common thermoacoustic hybrid models in Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches order of ascending accuracy and cost, without any claim to be comprehensive. Compare also Fig. 3.03. • Network models are most often based on the assumption that the acoustics mainly travel along one dimension (usually the axial or azimuthal direction). The gas turbine is then represented by the connection of multiple fundamental elements, such as ducts of constant cross-section, area jumps or (non-)reﬂecting terminations. The ﬂame is assumed to be compact with respect to acoustic waves in most models, i.e. the acoustic wave lengths are much larger than the spatial extent of the ﬂame, such that it can be approximated by a discontinuity in the network. The propagation of acoustic waves through the fundamental elements as well as the inﬂuence of perturbed heat release rate on the acoustics is known analytically. It is thus possible to connect these elements to form a compound model. To account for the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction that can not be described sufﬁciently in a 1 D manner, a global FTF relating the perturbed heat release rate to time delayed upstream velocity ﬂuctuations is often employed. The connected network model can be used to analyze the thermoacoustic stability of the system. • Thermoacoustic models based on the 2 D/3 D Helmholtz equation describe the acoustic wave propagation purely with the speed of sound, neglecting the inﬂuence of the mean ﬂow velocities. The system under consideration is often modeled as a continuous com- putational domain, which can feature geometrically complex shapes, as are common in gas turbines. The ﬂow-ﬂame interaction is accounted for in a similar way to the network model approach, although the heat release zone has a ﬁnite extent. The inﬂuence of per- turbed heat release rate on the acoustic ﬁeld is inherently represented by the source term in the Helmholtz equation, as opposed to the explicitly formulated relation used in network models. • The Linearized Navier-Stokes and Linearized Euler Equations are used to model the acoustic, hydrodynamic and entropic perturbations of a ﬂow which account for or ne- glect, respectively, thermo-viscous effects. The augmentation of the acoustic propagation velocity by the mean ﬂow is inherently accounted for. These features lead to an increased accuracy in thermoacoustic stability predictions, but come at signiﬁcant additional cost and numerical challenges compared to the Helmholtz equation. As for the previous mod- els, the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction is taken into account by an external submodel such as an FTF. 3.02.04 Disadvantages The ramiﬁcations of introducing simplifying assumptions to the governing equations can be severe. As shown in the course of this thesis research, the seemingly appropriate assumption that an acoustically compact ﬂame can be modeled with a single input / single output global FTF, generates signiﬁcant amounts of spurious entropy in a thermoacoustic hybrid model that relies on the LNSE to represent the propagation of acoustics and ﬂow perturbations. Contrarily, the more general LRF, as well as LNSE coupled to a local FTF, show good agreement with reference solutions from CFD. Thus, care has to be taken when simplifying assumptions are made, and it is often preferable to solve for the computationally more expensive LRF equations. 3.02 Hybrid Models In addition to the advantage of not requiring an external ﬂow-ﬂame interaction model, the results from LRF allow investigation of the involved species transport, which can be advantageous especially for technically premixed ﬂames. For these, acoustic forcing induces ﬂuctuations in mixture ratio at the injector, which are then dispersed while being convected towards the ﬂame. Representing this mechanism in a hybrid model requires an additional input for an FTF, while it is inherently captured by the LRF. Hybrid Thermoacoustic Modeling Approaches 4 The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics The Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of the most generic approaches to solve partial differ- ential equations numerically. Due to its ﬂexibility regarding the formulation, easy extensibility to higher order schemes as well as the applicability to curved meshes, FEM is widely used in nearly every ﬁeld of science and engineering. The following section will shed light on the dif- ﬁculties for employing a standard FEM in problems of ﬂuid mechanics, as well as an adaption, the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DG-FEM), to circumvent these. 4.01 Fundamentals of the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Ele- ment Method For ease of demonstration, this section is only concerned with scalar-valued governing equa- tions. The Finite Element Method can also be expanded to systems of equations without essen- tial difﬁculty. The idea behind the Finite Element Method is to project a differential equation for the unknown quantity u(x, t), L(u(x, t)) = 0, (4.01) onto a function w(x) based in a space V of ﬁnite dimensionality and then postulate that the residual integrated over the domain of interest Ω, instead of the residual of the differential equation at every point, has to vanish for all w(x). As this alleviates the conditions that the solution has to adhere to, this form is called the weak form. ∫ Ω w(x)L(u(x, t))d x = 0 (4.02) If the solution u(x, t) is sought from the same space V, onto which the differential equation is projected, a Galerkin methodresults. One major difference to other numerical methods for solving differential equations is that the FEM solves the approximate problem exactly (within computational accuracy), rather than ﬁnding an approximate solution to the exact problem (Fi- nite Difference Method, Finite V olume Method). This is due to the projection of the differential equation with an inﬁnite dimensional solution space onto a ﬁnite dimensional space, in which the exact solution can be found. Various formulations of the FEM can be derived by choosing the spaces for the projection of the differential equation and the basis for the solution. In the context of the FEM, the computational The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics domain is approximated by a partition Ph, which is the union of K non-overlapping elements Ωe, Ω≈ K (Ph)⋃ Ωe ∈Ph Ωk e. (4.03) The functions w(x),u(x, t) are then approximated as the sum of local functionswk h(x),uk h(x, t), which are non-zero only within one respective element Ωk e, w(x) ≈ wh(x) = K⨁ k=1 wk h(x), (4.04) u(x, t) ≈ uh(x, t) = K⨁ k=1 uk h(x, t). (4.05) The element wise deﬁned functionswk h(x) and uk h(x, t) are chosen as a weighted sum of test and trial functions, respectively. Two common choices for the test/trial functions are the modal and the nodal form. The former employs locally deﬁned polynomialsψn(x) of order n = 0,Np −1 as basis with ˆwk n and ˆuk n(t) as the weights for the test and trial functions. The basis for the nodal form can be deﬁned by a set of interpolating Lagrange polynomials lk i (x) on Np local stencils with position xk i, alongside their weights wk i and uk i. wk h(x) = Np∑ n=1 ˆwk nψn(x) = Np∑ i=1 wk i lk i (x) (4.06) uk h(x) = Np∑ n=1 ˆuk n(t)ψn(x) = Np∑ i=1 uk i (t)lk i (x) (4.07) Note that in this context, the indexi of the expression xk i does not refer to the spatial coordinate, but is instead the summation index representing thei-th stencil position that is connected to the weighting factor uk i of element k. The nodal basis functions lk i (x) are unity at xk i and zero at xk j, j ̸= i. The properties of the resulting method are determined by the space from which ψn(x) or lk i (x) are taken. For the Discontinuous Galerkin method used in this thesis, discontinuous nodal basis functions with Gauß-Lobatto node positions are employed and the test and trial functions are taken from the same space V (Ph). Figures 4.01 and 4.02 show continuous and discontinuous nodal basis functions of ﬁrst order in one dimension, represented by Lagrange polynomials. While the continuous basis has only one node at the element interfaces, which is a shared anchor point for the basis in both adjacent elements, the discontinuous basis has a duplicate node at the element interfaces. Thus, the basis for adjacent elements in the DG-FEM has no inherent connection. x k k +1 k −1 Figure 4.01: Continuous linear nodal basis functions in one dimension. 4.02 Comparison to other Numerical Methods x k k +1 k −1 Figure 4.02: Discontinuous linear nodal basis functions in one dimension. Due to the discontinuous nature of the basis functions, the integration of the governing equa- tion as deﬁned in Eq. (4.02) can not be performed on the computational domain Ω as a whole, but on the individual elements Ωk e instead. In contrast to the standard FEM, the solutions of the elements are thus not inherently coupled. To reintroduce this connection, the Gauß theorem is applied to the divergence terms of the governing equation, leading to a term describing the ﬂux over the boundaries of every cell. This manipulation is a necessity in deriving the discrete form of the governing equations in the Finite V olume Method, thus the similarity between both methods. On a very general level, the DG-FEM can be seen as a Finite V olume Method be- tween cells, where the ﬂux conveys information, and a Finite Element Method in the element interiors, where the solution is approximated on a given basis. Thus, the best of both worlds can be combined: a stable and robust ﬂux can be chosen to guarantee a conservative and stable numerical scheme, and higher order basis functions may be employed, tailored to the physics of the problem, which provide superior convergence and accuracy. The main ﬁeld of application for DG-FEM is the numerical solution of pure or mixed hyperbolic differential equations, such as the Euler, Navier-Stokes, or Maxwell’s equations. An otherwise unstabilized FEM discretization leads to a numerically unstable scheme for these equations. In the framework of the DG-FEM, the inter-cell ﬂux can be chosen based on the solutions of the two neighboring cells, analogously to the Finite V olume formulation. Due to the decades of experience in hyperbolic problem solving with the Finite V olume Method, there is a plethora of ﬂux formulations available, which generate stable, non-oscillatory solutions for differential equations governing directional physical processes. There is no essential difﬁculty in applying these formulations to the DG-FEM, facilitating the rapid development of consistent and stable methods. 4.02 Comparison to other Numerical Methods The Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the Finite V olume Method (FVM) are, next to FEM in general, two of the most popular methods for numerically solving partial differential equations in science and engineering. Some important aspects to evaluate when choosing one of these methods in comparison to (DG-)FEM are as follows (loosely based on ): • Mesh compatibility: Due to the higher order basis functions usable in the FEM, curved meshes consisting of non-straight elements can be employed. This is especially impor- tant if round shapes, such as a circular duct, have to be represented. While it is possible to treat curvilinear meshes with the FVM, it requires much more effort to achieve highly accurate schemes than with the FEM. For the FDM, curved boundaries are not The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics commonly used. Beyond the treatment of curved meshes, the FVM suffers from conver- gence and accuracy falloff if the connection line between two neighboring cell centers is not orthogonal to their inter-cell boundary. This is because the values of the unknown variables have to be known on the interface to compute the ﬂux, but are typically stored in the cell centers. For ﬂux reconstruction, interpolation schemes are employed, which are not representative for the whole interface if the cells are strongly non-orthogonal or skew. The DG-FEM method excels in this regard, because the solution by means of the weighted trial functions is known throughout the whole cell, and therefore the variables to compute the ﬂux can be evaluated directly at the inter-cell boundary. • Extensibility to higher order schemes:The extension of both the order of the discretiza- tion as well as the representation of the solution is straight forward with the (DG-)FEM, as the formulations for higher order basis functions are readily available. For the FDM, con- sidering additional neighboring nodes allows to derive higher order schemes with rather low effort. For the FVM, this issue is more complex because the ﬂux reconstruction on the element boundaries is required. Thus, the industry standard for FVM solvers are second order schemes. Note that while the (DG-)FEM approach to increasing the order is a local one, i.e. the basis function stays within the element even if the order is increased, both FDM and FVM require extended stencils ranging to (multiple) neighboring nodes. Inclu- sion of neighboring cells in the ﬂux discretization has three main disadvantages; ﬁrstly, the bandwidth of the discretized system matrix increases, which is detrimental for paral- lelization; secondly, at the boundaries, where no neighboring cells exist in one direction, either lower order or one-sided schemes have to be used, both of which negatively impact the accuracy of the method; and thirdly, on unstructured meshes it is not a trivial task to deﬁne what the neighboring cells are. • Efﬁcient explicit time-stepping: The mass matrix resulting from the standard continu- ous FEM is, opposed to all other methods including DG-FEM, not block-diagonal. This leads to a comparatively costly matrix inversion if explicit time-stepping is employed. In contrast, a block-diagonal matrix can be inverted by individual inversion of the blocks, which are usually much smaller than the mass matrix as a whole. • Degrees of freedom: The major drawback of the DG-FEM is that a multiple degrees of freedom for each variable are stored at each node, cf. Fig. 4.02. For linear basis functions, this increases the degrees of freedom by a factor of 2 D compared to the standard FEM, where D is the spatial dimension. However, because increasing the order of the method does not add additional nodes to the mesh, but only stencils for the basis functions inside the cells, this factor between the Discontinuous Galerkin and continuous FEM approaches unity for very high orders. From a cost oriented perspective, it is thus desirable to employ a coarser mesh with higher order basis functions in the DG-FEM approach, i.e. to strive for an optimal combination of p and h convergence. Beyond DG-FEM, there are also various other stabilized Finite Element Methods that can be applied to solve aero- and thermoacoustic governing equations. Two well known representa- tives are the Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) and the Galerkin Least Squares (GLS) approach. In both of these methods, artiﬁcial terms weighed by a stabilization pa- rameter are added to the governing equations in order to suppress spurious solutions. These 4.03 Application to Thermoacoustics methods are very sensitive to the amount of the introduced stabilization, as shown by Hofmeis- ter et al for the investigation of vortex shedding at a combustor inlet, employing LEE with an SUPG scheme: while too little may not be sufﬁcient to produce a stable scheme, too much stabilization leads to artiﬁcial dissipation of the physical perturbations in the solution. Choosing the amount of stabilization for a predictive method, i.e. without any available valida- tion data to match numerical results, is challenging. However, strategies are being developed to elicit the physical damping of stabilized FEM solutions by comparison to results produced with governing equations that do not require stabilization. 4.03 Application to Thermoacoustics The DG-FEM has been widely employed in aeroacoustics (see e.g. [41–44]), but has not seen, to this date, any application in thermoacoustics except for the studies connected to this thesis. The connection of these two topics is straightforward however, because the governing equa- tions of aero- and thermoacoustics share commonalities to a great extent, with the exception of the source terms. Starting with LEE, which are commonly used governing equations in aeroa- coustics, one can arrive at the various governing equations used in thermoacoustics by adding additional terms. The addition of thermo-viscous terms to the LEE yields the LNSE. Further expanding the set of equations by adding linearized species transport equations alongside a linearized reaction mechanism leads to the LRF. In the DG-FEM framework, these additional terms and equations are treated independently from each other, thus allowing the numerical formulation to mirror the hierarchy of the governing equations. For example, when the LEE are expanded to the LNSE by addition of the thermo- viscous terms, the original discretization of the LEE stays untouched. The convective terms are discretized employing either an approximate (local Lax-Friedrichs ﬂux) or exact upwinding ﬂux (e.g. obtained by ﬂux difference splitting) in order to construct a stable scheme. For the diffusive terms, a penalty formulation ﬁrst introduced by Babuška et. al for pure diffusion problems, and later expanded to convection-diffusion problems and the Navier-Stokes Equations by Baumann et al, is used. Source terms require no special numerical treatment. Boundary conditions can be given either in the strong or the weak form. While the former method directly eliminates the respective unknown variable and replaces it with the given value, the latter approach is based on providing the ﬂux (e.g. the perturbed energy ﬂow), such that the desired constraint (e.g. T ′ = 0) will automatically be fulﬁlled by the governing equations. Providing the boundary conditions in the weak form is the naturally emerging alternative to the strong form, and lends itself very well to the DG-FEM formulation, in which the communication between cells and across the boundary of the computational domain is purely realized via the ﬂux. Beyond this, it is straight forward to incorporate coupled boundary conditions, such as an anechoic outlet ( p′ = ¯ρcu′ ·n for zero mean ﬂow), in the weak form. In practice, it proved useful to combine the use of boundary conditions in both strong form and weak forms. Velocity perturbations at no-slip walls can easily be eliminated via strong boundary conditions, whereas giving isothermal boundary conditions ( T ′ = 0) is not possible in the strong form, because T ′ is not one of the independent variables. Instead, the coupled boundary condition p′/ ¯p = ρ′/ ¯ρ is given in the weak form. The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics 4.04 Diagonalization of the Non-Viscous Flux The LRF, Eqs. (2.08)-(2.011), as well as all derived equations thereof, can be written in matrix vector representation. M ∂Φ′ ∂t + ∂F j ∂xj = ∂F v j ∂xj +s (4.08) F j and F v j are the non-viscous and viscous ﬂux, respectively, while M is the mass matrix and s is a vector containing the sources. Both F j and F v j can be expressed as product of operators containing only the mean ﬁelds (and spatial derivatives thereof) and the unknown perturbation quantities Φ′. F j = K j Φ′, F v j = K v j Φ′ (4.09) The formulation of F j is of special interest here, as the eigenvalues of the matrices K j are the ﬂux characteristics of the non-viscous part of the ﬂow. The diagonalization of the non-viscous ﬂux prefactor matrix K j normal to a surface with unit normal vector componentsnj reveals the eigenvalues and -vectors : Fn = K j nj Φ′ =V ΛV −1Φ′. (4.010) V is a matrix containing the eigenvectors of K j as rows, while Λ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues λ1.λND +NK +2 of the non-viscous ﬂux of LRF equations on the diagonal, where ND is the spatial dimension and NK is the number of species transport equations. Subsequently to the diagonalization, the ﬂux can be split into contributions leaving and entering the domain through the boundary. This is done by accounting for only the positive or negative entries ofΛ. Based on this procedure, the numerical boundary conditions can be given in terms of the char- acteristics entering the computational domain, and accurate directional discretization schemes such as the ﬂux difference splitting approach can be employed. The resulting eigenvalues exhibit either acousticλac = ¯uj nj ±c or convectiveλcon = ¯uj nj prop- agation speed. The convective waves comprise vortices (if ND > 1), entropy waves and the characteristics for species transport. Note that due to the diagonal form of Λ, these characteris- tics propagate independently of each other, as long as the mean ﬂow is homogeneous, viscous effects are absent and no coupling at boundaries exists. In a homogeneous mixture without viscous effects and spatial gradients in the mean ﬂow, i.e. a ﬂow governed by the LEE, the vor- tical characteristics only inﬂuence velocity perturbations, the entropy waves only act on density perturbations, while the acoustic waves perturb all ﬁelds, including the pressure. As soon as viscous effects are accounted for in the governing equations, such as the LNSE, the system is no longer hyperbolic in nature, and thus strictly speaking, no characteristics exist. This is caused by the impact of the diffusion-type terms, which act on the whole domain with inﬁnite propagation velocity due to the continuum assumption on the ﬂuid. In applications, however, it is found that when viscous terms are not dominant, i.e. at sufﬁciently large Peclet numbers, the LNSE and LRF can be treated as a superposition of the hyperbolic system with its characteristics and the diffusion-type terms, thus allowing for ﬂux-difference splitting and boundary conditions based on the characteristic waves. Figure 4.03 illustrates the propagation of the vortical and acoustic characteristics in a perturbed nozzle ﬂow governed by the LNSE. Even though viscous effects are present, the separation 4.05 Implementation: felicita X Figure 4.03: Radial velocity perturbations (top half of each depiction) and pressure perturbations (bottom half) of a nozzle forced acoustically at the inlet, computed with LNSE. The mean ﬂow is slightly subsonic, forcing frequency is 800 Hz. between the characteristics is still obvious. V ortices form in the shear layers induced after the throat of the nozzle and are convected downstream. Their wavelength reduces with increasing nozzle diameter as a result of reduced axial mean ﬂow velocity. The acoustic perturbations can clearly be seen in the pressure perturbations. They feature larger wavelengths than the vortices. The coupling between both characteristics is strong only in the throat, where ﬂow separation at the transition from the convergent section induces pressure ﬂuctuations at the no-slip bound- aries. 4.05 Implementation: felicita X felicita X is a Finite Element Linearized Combustion Thermo-/Aeroacoustics solver using the above described DG-FEM discretization method. It is based on the open-source computing platform FEni CS, version 2019.01.00. FEni CS provides the framework for the automated derivation of discretized systems based on the weak form of the governing equations, as well as pre- and post-processing routines such as mesh interfacing, ﬁle in-/output and evaluation of symbolic expressions. The software is written in C++ and Python, and provides interfaces in both languages for the user interaction. The focus of felicita X is on extensibility, modularity and rapid prototyping. 4.05.01 Dogma and Fundamentals Making use of the Python interface of FEni CS, felicita X provides a modularized, object- oriented approach to generate the weak form of the governing equations for thermo- and aeroa- coustics, including LEE, LNSE and LRF. This includes the appropriate treatment of the mean ﬂow via interpolation, as well as providing boundary conditions in strong and weak forms. The aim of the development was to abstract the numerical details of the implementation from the The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics user, such that minimal input is required, albeit the user should stay in full control over the form of the governing equations and boundary conditions. Therefore, the required inputs are: • A mesh for the linearized computations. The open-source mesher GMSH was found to be well suited for all geometries and cases encountered in connection to this thesis. FEni CS provides easy interfacing for GMSH meshes. • Mean ﬂow ﬁelds in the form of a comma-separated-value (.csv) ﬁle. The spatial reso- lution provided here is usually (but not necessarily) higher than that of the mesh for the linearized computations. The interpolation of the mean ﬂow values to the mesh is then handled by felicita X via a multi-dimensional unstructured interpolation algorithm pro- vided in the Python package scipy. First, triangulation with the Quickhull algorithm is performed. Afterwards, the mean ﬂow values at the nodes of the target mesh are computed via piecewise linear barycentric interpolation on the input data. • A study type (time-domain, frequency response or eigenvalues) with appropriate param- eters, e.g. the time-step width and the total simulation time, or the frequencies to be solved for. • A ﬂux scheme. Currently, the local Lax-Friedrichs ﬂux as well as ﬂux difference splitting are implemented. Note that the user can choose the ﬂux, but does not need to provide details about the implementation. • The order of the basis functions. • The physical model, from which the parameters used forsimpliﬁcations of the governing equations can be derived. This includes whether viscous terms and the ﬂuctuation of the material values such as µ′ and λ′ should be included, whether the perturbed ﬂow is isentropic, and whether a reacting ﬂow is present. • An optional FTF in state-space representation, stored in.csv ﬁles. If an FTF is provided, a reference position as well as the ﬁeld of the mean heat release rate needs to be deﬁned by the user as well. After these inputs are made by the user,felicita X returns the according weak form of the gov- erning equations in a symbolic representation that is not yet discretized. Subsequently, boundary conditions are set either in the strong or the weak form. Boundary conditions in the strong form can only be applied to the unknown variables of the perturbed ﬂow, i.e. ( ρ′,u′ i, p′,Y ′ k )T. Weak boundary conditions are required for isothermal walls and characteristics based conditions, such as arbitrary acoustic reﬂection coefﬁcients. However, many of the physical boundary conditions such as an acoustically open end ( p′ = 0) or a slip-wall ( u′ ·n = 0) can be prescribed both in the strong or weak form. To make it easier for the user to provide the correct ﬂux in the weak form, common cases are already pre-deﬁned in ﬂux functions, e.g. set_flux_pressure (al- lows for pressure ﬂuctuations at a boundary, should be omitted at an acoustically open end) or set_flux_heat_conduction (admits a ﬂux through heat conduction at the boundary, should be set for isothermal and omitted for adiabatic walls). In this way, the weak boundary conditions are set in an additive way, i.e. adding the ﬂux expressions for the mechanisms that occur at a certain boundary, rather in a subtractive way, which would be to provide the full ﬂux and then 4.05 Implementation: felicita X eliminate the mechanisms that should not be present. This step requires knowledge of the gov- erning equations as well as physically sensible boundary conditions from the user. Providing an incomplete or inconsistent ﬂux can lead to spurious artifacts in the solution of the problem. Once the weak form, including boundary conditions, is fully set up, the discretization is per- formed with a FEni CS built in function. The resulting system of linear equations can subse- quently be solved with direct solvers (based on a lower/upper decomposition of the system matrix) or through iterative solvers employing Krylov subspace methods, such as GMRES or Bi CGStab. For post-processing, felicita X provides functionality to visualize full-period animations for complex solutions stemming from studies in the Laplace domain, such as eigenmodes. 4.05.02 Usage Examples The following code snippets are intended to give the reader an impression of the usage of felicita X. They do not serve as a documentation and are not executable on their own, as they are embedded in a bigger script. # Read meanflow from. csv file and interpolate to mesh. fieldnames = { \"U:0\":\"u Mean_axial\", \"U:1\":\"u Mean_radial\", \"rho\":\"rho Mean\", \"T\":\"TMean\", \"p\":\"p Mean\", \"h\":\"h Sens Mean\" } meanflow = ctf. interpolate_all_meanfields_from_csv ( meanflow_file, fieldnames, mesh, order =2, parallel = True ) One of the ﬁrst steps after loading the mesh (not shown here) is the interpolation of the mean- ﬂow ﬁelds onto the computation mesh. The ﬁrst expression deﬁnes a dictionary of the ﬁelds to be read from.csv ﬁle via their column header name as key and their name in the workspace as value. Then, the interpolation routine is called in a second step with parallel execution via threading being requested. # Options class for felicita X. DGOpts = felicitax. fem. opts.

Weak Form ( DGOpts ) The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics This part of the code illustrates the options the user sets for the ﬂow, as described in the previous subsection. Note that the ds holds the boundaries of mesh and is deﬁned ear- lier in this script from an imported mesh ﬁle generated with GMSH. The Python dictio- nary meanflow is the result of mean-ﬁeld interpolation from the previous step. The local Lax-Friedrichs ﬂux prefactor lff_prefactor controls the amount of upwinding. The class felicitax.fem.opts.Opts serves as a container for the options and includes parameter checks to ensure sensible settings. The weak form is generated when an instance of the class felicitax.fem.weakform.Weak Form is generated with the DGOpts object as input. # Set the flux and implicitly account for weak boundary conditions.

Due to the choice of ﬂux contributions, and the intentional omission of some parts on speciﬁc boundaries, the conditions are enforced. boundary is a dictionary relating the human readable boundary speciﬁers (like inflow) to their respective internal representations as integers. # Dirichlet boundary conditions in strong form.

The variables of the LNSE, e.g.u R as the real part of the perturbed velocity ﬁeld, are chosen, as well as the respective boundaries, for which the values should be constrained. for sol in frequency_sweep (LNSE, bcs, freqvec ): # Post - processing loop. # Retrieve solution. u R = project ( sol. sub ( LNSE. get_field_id (\"u R\")), V_mean ) u I = project ( sol. sub ( LNSE. get_field_id (\"u I\")), V_mean ) # Write phase animation of velocity perturbation to file. postproc. save_phase_animation_xdmf ( filename = result Folder + f\"/{ freq } Hz_phi. xdmf \", mesh =mesh, u={\"u\": (u R, u I), n_phi =60 ) Finally, the assembling and solution of the equation system happens in the Python generator expression frequency_sweep, which takes as input parameters the weak form, boundary con- ditions in the strong form as well as a list of frequencies to be solved for. The solution step, which is typically by far the computationally most expensive part of the whole procedure, can be run in serial, threaded or in parallel on multiple machines, depending on how FEni CS was compiled. Note that the weak form already comprises the weakly imposed boundary condi- tions. In the loop created by the generator, the user can access the solution ﬁelds sol for post- processing purposes. In this case, the real and imaginary parts of the velocity perturbations are extracted and a phase animation, dividing the period into 60 steps, is saved to.xdmf ﬁle. This functionality is provided from the postproc module of felicita X. The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method in Thermoacoustics 5 Modular Systems in the State-Space Framework Hybrid thermoacoustic models require the interconnection of several submodels to form a rep- resentation that encompasses all physical aspects governing combustion instabilities. In general, the connections are formulated as (usually algebraic) equations to relate a subset of the degrees of freedom between the submodels. The state-space representation, as a unifying modeling framework, has shown to be well suited to deﬁne the interfaces between the submodels and offers a strongly formalized procedure to establish the connections. 5.01 State-Space Systems The state-space framework is a formalized representation for a system of linear time-invariant (LTI) ordinary differential equations. Edx(t) dt = Ax(t) +Bu(t) (5.01) y(t) = Cx(t) +Du(t) (5.02) The matrices A,B and E govern the temporal evolution of the state vector x under the inﬂuence of inputs u. The output y of the system is deﬁned as a linear combination of the states and the inputs via C and D. Due to their LTI nature, both the linear acoustic (ranging from network to LNSE) as well as the ﬂow-ﬂame models can be represented in state-space form. This is also possible for models emerging from the discretization of the LRF equations. 5.01.01 Solution Procedures Equation (5.01) is formulated in the time domain and can be solved non-iteratively due to lin- earity. However, most linear thermoacoustic studies are not carried out in the time-domain. Applying the Laplace transformation, Eq. (2.014), to the state vector results in the state-space formulation in the Laplace domain: Esˆx(s) = Aˆx(s) +Bˆu(s) (5.03) ˆy(s) = Cˆx(s) +Dˆu(s) (5.04) In this form, the input-output transfer behavior ˆG(s) of a state-space system can be computed for a given frequency s. ˆG(s) = ˆy(s) ˆu(s)−⊤ = C(Es −A)−1 B+D (5.05) Modular Systems in the State-Space Framework When no input signal is present, eigenvalues and -vectors of the autonomous system can be com- puted. For small systems, where the degrees of freedom are approximately lower than 104, it is viable to compute all the eigenvalues. However, the computational demand increases rapidly for larger systems and higher order eigenvalues are deemed irrelevant in thermoacoustic stability analysis, such that it is common practice to only compute a few of the eigenvalues for those sys- tems. One of the most popular algorithms is the implicitly restarted iterative Arnoldialgorithm. In order to control, which of the eigenvalues the algorithm will converge to, a shift-invert procedure can be applied to the eigenvalue problem. Therefore, a complex shift frequency sshift is chosen around which the inversion is constructed. This leads to the shift-inverted eigenvalue problem formulation, (A−sshift E)−1 Eˆv(s) = 1 s −sshift ˆv(s) (5.06) The shift can be interpreted as the new origin of the complex plane, in which the eigenvalues lie and consequently the algorithm can be set to ﬁnd eigenvalues closest to the shift. Choosing the shift correctly requires some a priori knowledge about the system, e.g. the frequency band of interest, which can be guessed from the gain of the FTF, or a network model approximation of the large system, which allows to have an estimate of the relevant eigenvalues. 5.01.02 Interconnection of State-Space Systems The matrices A to E of two systems 1 and 2 are appended block-diagonally to form the basis of the respective matrices for the connected system. The link is then established by feeding an output signal y 1 of system 1 into the input u 2 of system 2 and vice versa. This is realized by a feedback equation with the binary feedback matrix F. ˜u = F˜y+u (5.07) This feedback equation represents the intermediate input vector˜u as the sum of fed back internal outputs ˜y and true external inputs u to the connected system, which originate from the origi- nal systems and are not interconnected. Resolving Eq. (5.07) by applying the output equation, Eq. (5.02) to it, yields the new, connected system matrices. 5.02 Use Cases of State-Space Interconnect Models The most common use of the state-space interconnect approach is the connection of a ﬂow- ﬂame submodel to an acoustic submodel in hybrid models. However, there are other ﬁelds of application where this strategy is advantageous. A technique described and applied in is aimed at reducing the overall computational cost of thermoacoustic stability analysis while accurately accounting for the interactions between perturbations and the mean ﬂow. This is achieved by representing the crucial parts of the combustor (in this case the swirl generator as well as the combustion zone) with high-ﬁdelity governing equations, e.g. the LNSE, while other parts, such as the plenum and the combustion chamber extension, are approximated by 1 D network models. This shows the generality and potential of the state-space interconnect 5.02 Use Cases of State-Space Interconnect Models approach: it is possible to seamlessly combine linear submodels of different complexity, making use of the respective advantages of all modeling approaches employed. Beyond the connection of models emerging from discretization of governing equations, it is also possible to represent non-trivial, frequency dependent impedances and scattering matri- ces, e.g. from experimental measurements, in state-space form. To this end, a rational complex polynomial in s is ﬁtted to the discrete data points of the measured frequency response, thus yielding a continuous transfer function. This transfer function can be converted analytically to a state-space model, thus making it suited for interconnection. Modular Systems in the State-Space Framework 6 Contextualization and Discussion of Publications This chapter clariﬁes the context between individual publications and provides their relation to literature. The goal of the series of publications encompassed in this thesis is the development of linear thermoacoustic models with increased prediction accuracy, while remaining in the region of affordable computational cost. Throughout the series of papers, less and less simpliﬁcations are made to the governing equations, thus increasingly accounting for effects that strongly simpli- ﬁed models do not take into account. This yields not only more accurate predictions of ther- moacoustic instabilities, but also provides more consistency with real combustion devices. As a result, spurious effects, which stem from simpliﬁed modeling, can be eliminated by more comprehensive approaches. Thus, results are more reliable and the numerical models are more robust, because there is less impact of modeling decisions on the results. However, more knowl- edge about the numerical treatment, especially concerning boundary conditions, is required. The ﬁrst important step towards the general framework for multi-dimensional linear thermoa- coustic models starts with the extension of the state-space interconnect approach from one- dimensional to two/three-dimensional models. Compared to the ﬁrst appearance of the state- space interconnect approach in thermoacoustics by Schuermans et al, the ﬂow-ﬂame in- teraction model is also formulated in the state-space formalism, allowing for a linear instead of a non-linear eigenvalue problem. While the state-space interconnect methodology is pre- sented mainly in PAPER-CONNECT, the seamless inclusion of an n −τ ﬂow-ﬂame model in state-space form as well as a comparison to a state-of-the-art Helmholtz solver is detailed in PAPER-EFFICIENT. Retaining the linearity of the physical problem in the numerical repre- sentation leads to signiﬁcantly less computational cost, equaling a shorter turnaround time for stability predictions compared to other approaches with similar accuracy. Beyond this, the unifying modeling strategy provided by the state-space approach allows for interconnection of models with different governing equations resulting from varying degrees of simpliﬁcation to the physics of ﬂuid dynamics and combustion. This is a cornerstone of subsequent papers, in which simple parts of the burner under investigation are modeled by one-dimensional net- work models, while swirl generator and combustion zone are represented by highly resolved three-dimensional models stemming from DG-FEM discretization of governing equations that account for mean-ﬂow and (thermo-)viscous effects. A similar approach, well known in lit- erature, is to connect acoustic transfer-matrices to domains modeled by discretized acoustic governing equations [57–61]. In these studies, segments of the system under investigation were modeled by transfer matrices, which the discretized governing equations could not represent well enough, e.g. because of strong interaction between acoustics and hydrodynamics. While this approach typically yields a strong reduction of degrees of freedom, it requires a source for Contextualization and Discussion of Publications the transfer matrices – usually experimental measurements or costly CFD simulations. Cou- pling of discretized models based on different governing equations, as done in the studies of this thesis, can yield additional information: the interaction between acoustics and hydrody- namics, which can often contribute to the growth or dampening of thermoacoustic instabilities, is resolved and can thus be analyzed in the context of eigenmodes, rather than being hidden in a lumped model like a transfer matrix. A Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element approach for solving the Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations in conservative form, or any simpliﬁcations thereof, is presented in PAPER-DGFEM. The paper suggests application of this numerical method in thermoacoustics. Strengths of DG- FEM are the physically motivated stabilization via an upwind ﬂux between elements, as well as the straightforward extension to higher order schemes. Compared to a stabilized continuous Finite Element Method for the LNSE that has previously been applied to thermoacoustic prob- lems, DG-FEM proved to be more accurate and reliable for semi-analytical validation cases. Alongside the validation case, the paper shows the capability of this approach to deter- mine thermoacoustic eigenvalues with increased accuracy compared to a network model. As a novelty, a single state-space model comprises the combustion device under investigation that is split into a core of the combustion chamber including the swirl generator, an upstream and a downstream section. While the core is modeled by three-dimensional LNSE discretized with DG-FEM, the dimensionality of other sections is reduced to only the longitudinal aspect, and thus they can be modeled by a network approach. This divide and conquer ansatz yields accurate predictions of the thermoacoustic instabilities, while remaining in the affordable computational regime. A cross-comparison to a pure network representation of the complete burner shows that the three-dimensional LNSE discretization of the burner core inﬂuences the predicted growth- rates of thermoacoustic eigenvalues. Strong interaction between the unsteady heat-release rate of the ﬂame, the acoustics and the hydrodynamics can be seen during instability in the combus- tion region as well as the ﬂow directly downstream of the swirl generator. The resolution of this interplay allows to reason about the role of convective time-delays between swirler and ﬂame in the eigenfrequency of intrinsic thermoacoustic instabilities – an advantage that is missing in modeling approaches that represent regions of complex geometry and ﬂow with a lumped way, e.g. with a transfer matrix [57–61]. PAPER-SCATTERING compares the differences in acoustic scattering behavior predictions of two swirl generators, when various approaches with varying simpliﬁcations are em- ployed. While PAPER-DGFEM focused on numerical methodology and a comparison between two extremes – one-dimensional network-model versus three-dimensional LNSE – PAPER- SCATTERING demonstrates the differences on a more ﬁne-grained scale of simpliﬁcations to governing equations. Three approaches, namely Helmholtz, Linearized Euler Equations and Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations are employed to discretize the swirl generators under in- vestigation. Reference results as well as the mean-ﬂow ﬁelds are provided by Large Eddy Sim- ulation. Results of the linearized methods show increasingly good agreement, when more phys- ical mechanisms, such as mean-ﬂow (Linearized Euler Equations) and viscous effects (Lin- earized Navier-Stokes Equations), are accounted for. The paper also conﬁrms an effect seen by Kierkegaard et al, that Linearized Euler Equations generate unphysical amounts of vor- ticity in the boundary layers near walls, which seems to be connected to the discrepancy in boundary conditions between the mean-ﬂow (no-slip) and the linearized perturbation approach (slip). Therefore, it is concluded that accounting for viscous effects, which allows to prescribe no-slip boundary conditions, not only increases the accuracy but also the robustness of this methodology. The last major step in methodological development in the frame of this thesis is published in PAPER-LRF. It represents the ﬁrst publication of an analytically Linearized Reactive Flow solver and is mainly concerned with validation against results from CFD. The numerical Dis- continuous Galerkin Finite Element methodology developed in PAPER-DGFEM is successfully employed. This paper marks the ﬁrst publication, in which a thermoacoustic system was inves- tigated by an analytically linearized fully compressible reactive ﬂow solver. The goal was to demonstrate quantitative accuracy without use of tunable parameters, by comparing to refer- ence solutions computed with CFD, from which also the mean-ﬂow was extracted. Albayrak et al demonstrated earlier, that the behavior of a swirl ﬂame subject to inertial wave forc- ing could be represented by a similar approach with a continuous Finite Element Method in the low Mach number regime. Weakly compressible Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations with a one-step chemistry were solved, based on a mean-ﬂow obtained by solving the non-linear set of equations with Newton’s method. Although it is possible to reproduce and investigate the ﬂame response with this methodology, thermoacoustic eigenmodes can not be computed be- cause the weakly compressible LNSE do not support the correct propagation of acoustic waves. Blanchard et. al investigated the response of a laminar premixed ﬂame to acoustic pertur- bations by means of a numerically linearized reactive ﬂow solver, though without quantitative agreement to reference data. The emphasis of this study was to reproduce the ﬂame behavior on a qualitative level, in order to investigate the spatially resolved perturbations in heat-release rate as well as their feedback on the unsteady ﬂow ﬁeld. Opposed to the numerical linearization, the analytical linearization used in the LRF approach in this thesis allows for ﬂexible choice of numerical scheme and spatial discretization of the computations. As no simpliﬁcations to the governing equations (beside linearization) are made, the highest degree of consistency to the simulation for the mean-ﬂow is guaranteed. Computational efﬁciency is achieved because it is no longer necessary to identify the ﬂow-ﬂame model a priori through CFD in the time-domain. These savings can typically more than compensate for the added degrees of freedom in the lin- earized simulations stemming from the discretized species transport equations, which are not necessary if a ﬂow-ﬂame model is used. Beyond the gain in prediction accuracy, the resolu- tion of the linearized reaction mechanism allows investigation of the physical processes in the combustion region during a thermoacoustic instability. The results show that a perturbed ﬂame front is not a monopole, but rather a dipole source of acoustic waves. This dipole pattern forms due to the movement of the ﬂame, which is strongly inﬂuenced by convective effects. A syn- chronization between the acoustic forcing and the convective displacement can lead to intrinsic thermoacoustic instabilities. In a lumped framework that models the ﬂame as a discontinuity in the ﬂow, rather than a spatially resolved ﬂame front, this lock-on between ﬂame and forcing is expressed in the π-criterion [66–68]. PAPER-ENTROPY employs the same fundamental governing equations and numerical method- ology as in PAPER-LRF. The only difference is that a partly reversible two-step chemical mech- anism is used to model the lean methane-air combustion in closer agreement to experimental data, rather than a one-step mechanism. The focus of this work is to demonstrate the spurious results that are obtained when simpliﬁcations in the governing equations or the overall approach are made in the context of linearized combustion dynamics. The response of a laminar ﬂame subject to acoustic forcing is investigated with a hybrid model, consisting of Linearized Navier- Contextualization and Discussion of Publications Stokes Equations coupled to a lumped ﬂame transfer function, and the monolithic Linearized Reactive Flow. While the perturbed heat-release rate due to acoustic forcing is correctly repre- sented by both models, the ensuing response of the ﬂow, especially generated entropy waves, differ signiﬁcantly. It is reasoned that due to the lack of ﬂame movement in the hybrid model, excessive amounts of spurious entropy are generated in the combustion zone, which contra- dict ﬁrst principles as well as reference results from CFD. This entropy is not only per se a wrong representation of physical mechanisms, but can additionally deteriorate the prediction of thermoacoustic modes due to a feedback mechanism between accelerated entropy waves and acoustics. The LRF on the other hand is in good agreement to reference data and behaves as expected from ﬁrst principles, because the locally resolved linearized reaction mechanism accounts for movement of the ﬂame due to an interplay between perturbations in ﬂow, temper- ature and transported species. This spurious entropy production has already been derived by Strobio Chen et al for a framework, in which the spatial extent of the ﬂame is neglected. Results given in a theoretical analysis by Yoon also show that regarding the ﬂame as a ﬁxed heat-source, rather than a moving ﬂame front in kinematic balance with the approaching ﬂow, leads to spurious entropy production. PAPER-ENTROPY sheds more light on the pro- cesses that are happening in the combustion zone itself, both when ﬂame movement is correctly represented, and when a ﬁxed ﬂame is considered. These ﬁndings continue the train of thought found throughout the whole thesis, which is that simplifying the overall approach or the gov- erning equations not only reduces the accuracy of results, but also gives rise to inconsistencies between CFD (mean-ﬂow, reference results) and the linearized models. Beyond that, the appar- ent savings in computational effort due to simpliﬁed approaches, like the hybrid one using a ﬂow-ﬂame interaction model, often turn out to be outperformed by a monolithic approach like the LRF. 7 Summary and Discussion of Papers In this chapter, the core ﬁnding of individual publications is laid out. Beyond this, the respec- tive contribution of the authors to each paper is stated. The publications are not sorted strictly chronologically, but rather in a way that underlines the progress made in the methodology. Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.01 Linear State-Space Interconnect Modeling of Acoustic Systems Label: PAPER-CONNECT Outcome: Linear state-space models of various origin, i.e. one-dimensional acoustic network models, three-dimensional perturbation equations, as well as ﬂow-ﬂame interaction models identiﬁed from Computational Fluid Dynamics, are connected in a state-space interconnect framework. The connected system is represented as a single state-space model. The result- ing eigenvalue problem is linear in the Laplace variable, facilitating non-iterative, robust and accurate solution procedures. Relevance for the thesis: This publication provides the backbone of the interconnect frame- work, demonstrating how sub-models of various spatial dimensionality and based on different governing equations can be merged to form a single model of the thermoacoustic system. Contribution: The research topic was jointly deﬁned by Wolfgang Polifke, Thomas Emmert, Stefan Jaensch and me. The state-space interconnect algorithm was implemented by Thomas Emmert in the in-house thermoacoustic network tool ta X, which is written in Matlab. I con- tributed the state-space models for the full as well as the segregated three-dimensional annular combustor. The manuscript was prepared by Thomas Emmert, proof reading and suggestions for improvement were given by all co-authors. Status: Published in Acta Acoustica united with Acoustica.

The acoustic perturbations are governed by the Linearized Euler Equations, the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction is modeled by a simplistic n −τ ansatz. The latter is formulated in terms of a discretized advection equation for the time delay, yielding a state-space model linear in the Laplace variable. The comparison to a Finite V olume solver of the Helmholtz equation based on ﬁxed-point iteration shows good agreement for the eigenfrequencies. The computational cost is signiﬁcantly lower, which is attributed to the linear eigenvalue problem emerging from the state-space approach with the discretized time-delay. Relevance for the thesis: This paper uses the interconnect framework of PAPER-CONNECT and applies it to a case including ﬂow-ﬂame interaction, rather than pure acoustic perturbations. The efﬁciency of formulating a linear eigenvalue problem by means of discretizing the time delay of the ﬂow-ﬂame model is presented. Contribution: Conceptualization of the topic was done in collaboration with all co-authors. Wolfgang Polifke supervised the work and gave critical feedback on both the methodology as well as the manuscript. Thomas Emmert implemented the state-space interconnect algorithm as well as the discretization of the n −τ ﬂame model via an advection equation. I contributed the Finite Element models, set up the case of the annular combustor and conducted all the computations. The manuscript was written by me, feedback and suggestions for improvement were made by all co-authors.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.03 A State-Space Formulation of a Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Thermoacoustic Stability Analysis Label: PAPER-DGFEM Outcome: A Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Discretization for the Linearized Navier- Stokes Equations is presented. The approach is based on a formulation for the non-linear Navier- Stokes and Euler Equations by Baumann et al. Compared to previously published results by a Galerkin Least Squares stabilized continuous Finite Element Method, the presented approach showed improved agreement with semi-analytical results for a one-dimensional vali- dation case ﬁrst investigated by Dowling. Subsequent analysis of a turbulent swirled com- bustion test rig demonstrated that the interaction between acoustic, hydrodynamic and entropic perturbations as well as the inﬂuence of spatial gradients in the mean-ﬂow can impact ther- moacoustic eigenvalues both in their oscillation frequency as well as their growth rate. It is important to note that those mechanisms can have a stabilizing as well as a destabilizing effect on the eigenmodes. Throughout the studies of this paper, state-space formulations as well as in- terconnection algorithms developed in PAPER-CONNECT are employed to connect models of varying spatial dimensionality, governing equations as well as the acoustic and the ﬂow-ﬂame sub-models. Relevance for the thesis: This publication validates the numerical approach – a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method – for the discretization of non self-adjoint governing equations like such as Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations. It is thus the second staple, next to the state- space framework, on which the methodology presented in this thesis is based on. Contribution: The research topic was deﬁned by me. The implementation of the numerical methods as well as the setup of the linear models was done by me. Alp Albayrak set up and ran the Large Eddy Simulation of the turbulent swirl combustor, which is required for the provision of the mean-ﬂow as well as identiﬁcation of the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction model. The manuscript was written in major parts by me, feedback, suggestions and improvements were given by all co-authors.

The latter two governing equations are solved with the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method introduced in PAPER-DGFEM. Results from Large Eddy Simulation and Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations agree well. The Linearized Euler Equations perform similar for most frequencies, but suffer from spurious unstable eigen- modes, which spoil the scattering behavior. The Helmholtz Equation underestimates the magni- tude of reﬂected waves signiﬁcantly. Accounting for this acoustic scattering in a network model of a combustor test rig is shown to impact the predicted eigenfrequencies. Relevance for the thesis:This publications shows that simpliﬁcations that are commonly made in aeroacoustics, e.g. non-viscous perturbations or neglect of the mean-ﬂow velocity, should not be employed when treating ducted ﬂows, ubiquitous in combustors. Contribution: The idea to investigate acoustic scattering of swirl generators was given by Wolf- gang Polifke. The Large Eddy Simulation for the radial swirl generator was conducted by Malte Merk. The linearized simulations were carried out by Fabian Fritz for the radial and by me for the axial swirl generator. The network model analysis was conducted by me. The section on the radial swirl generator was written by Fabian Fritz, except for the description of the Large Eddy Simulation, which was written by Malte Merk. The rest of the manuscript was written by me. Wolfgang Polifke contributed through discussion, feedback and improvements of the manuscript.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.05 Thermoacoustic Analysis of a Laminar Premixed Flame using a Linearized Reactive Flow Solver Label: PAPER-LRF Outcome: This paper is mainly concerned with the validation of a Linearized Reactive Flow Solver employing the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method introduced in PAPER- DGFEM. The subject of investigation is a small laminar ﬂame forced acoustically. The ﬂame response is compared to the ﬂame dynamics computed from an Open FOAM time series post- processed with system identiﬁcation. Good agreement for both adiabatic and isothermal ﬂame anchoring plates is observed. An eigenvalue analysis of the intrinsic thermoacoustic mode shows differences between the Linearized Reactive Flow solver and a hybrid approach con- sisting of Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations coupled to a Flame Transfer Function. Not only the resonance frequency, but also the mode shape differs. Relevance for the thesis: The publication introduces the Linearized Reactive Flow solver, fur- thering the development of linear thermoacoustic models towards higher accuracy in the pre- diction of instabilities. Contribution: The idea of linearizing – beyond the Navier-Stokes Equations – also the species transport equations and the reaction mechanism stems from Alexander Avdonin. The implemen- tation of the governing equations was conducted by me, with Alexander Avdonin contributing valuable ideas on discretization and formulation of the governing equations. Open FOAM sim- ulations were carried out by Alexander Avdonin, the linearized simulations were carried out in parts by Alexander Avdonin and me. The manuscript was written by Alexander Avdonin, all co-authors gave feedback and suggestions for improvement. Wolfgang Polifke supervised the whole process, providing valuable ideas and feedback on technical as well as conceptual aspects. Status: Published in Proceedings of the Combustion Institute.

The split of the acoustic and ﬂow-ﬂame sub-model is investigated for a one- and a two-dimensional ﬂame with both a global and a local ﬂow-ﬂame model identiﬁed from non-linear Open FOAM simulations. To this end, Linearized Navier-Stokes equations are employed as the acoustic sub-model. For both ﬂames, signiﬁcant generation of spurious entropy in the combustion zone is observed if a global ﬂow-ﬂame model is employed. The local ﬂow- ﬂame model remedies this problem. Additionally, it is shown that the Linearized Reactive Flow does not suffer from this problem, as the combustion dynamics is inherently accounted for locally. The spurious generation of entropy is explained by the lack of a global ﬂow-ﬂame model to account for ﬂame movement. The numerical discretization for the linear models is entirely done with the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method described in PAPER-DGFEM. Relevance for the thesis: This publication shows that the Linearized Reactive Flow is not only more accurate than hybrid models, but also less error prone in terms of modeling mistakes. Additionally, it demonstrates how ﬂame movement – a critical property of an acoustically forced ﬂame – can be accounted for in a spatially resolved combustion region. Contribution: Wolfgang Polifke conceptualized the idea that ﬂame movement needs to be ac- counted for in spatially resolved combustion regions. All the simulations as well as the writing of the ﬁrst version of the manuscript were done by me. Camilo Silva contributed the idea to in- vestigate hybrid models with a locally resolved ﬂow-ﬂame model. Wolfgang Polifke formulated the explanation for the spurious entropy in terms of lack of ﬂame movement. Major contribu- tions to the manuscript were made by Wolfgang Polifke and Camilo Silva through numerous internal revisions, suggestions and editing. Status: Published in Combustion and Flame.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 8 Outlook The Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method described in this thesis is the basis for the development of hybrid and monolithic thermoacoustic models governing the full spectrum of perturbations in the linear regime. A strong foundation is set for future research to build on. Progress can be aimed at both new numerical schemes as well as varying the formulation of the governing equations. Chances for improvement in the numerical treatment are to be seen in the various new ﬂux formulations emerging rapidly in the Finite Element context. For the pure hyperbolic parts of the ﬂux, exact ﬂux difference splitting by means of diagonalization of the ﬂux matrix is the optimum. However, when the number of equations increases, e.g. due to several species accounted for in the Linearized Reactive Flow, this is not a trivial task. The best choice for discretization of the diffusive terms is much more controversial, as stabilization or penalty methods have to be employed due to the discontinuous basis functions. Due to the prominent role of heat and species diffusion in combustion, studying the impact on accuracy and computational effort of newly emerging schemes for thermoacoustic problems should be aimed at. In the ﬁeld of governing equations, the main challenge lies in the modeling of linearized turbu- lent combustion with the Linearized Reactive Flow. Due to the unsteady nature of turbulence, there is no steady-state of the mean ﬂow computations, and thus – strictly speaking – no valid linearization point. However, practical cases showed that a time averaged mean ﬁeld of the un- steady ﬂow can still yield good results in terms of a non-reacting ﬂow stability analysis. Once combustion is added on top of turbulence, the main complication becomes that applying the reaction mechanism to the averaged mean ﬁelds, one does not recover the averaged mean heat release rate, i.e. the mean ﬂow itself is inconsistent. It is still an open question how to account for or circumvent this fundamental problem. Beyond the challenges that lie in modeling linearized turbulent combustion, the compute effort will also be signiﬁcantly larger than for the cases tackled in the scope of this thesis research. While solving small cases is a matter of minutes with a direct solver on a typical desktop com- puter, the use of iterative methods to solve the linear system of equations resulting for larger cases is a necessity. Preliminary studies, however, showed that the structure of the resulting ma- trix in the frequency domain, even for small cases, poses a problem for combinations of precon- ditioners and solvers that are typically employed in the ﬁeld of ﬂuid mechanics. Convergence towards the correct solution is either very slow, or not possible at all. Deriving a suitable pre- conditioning matrix is therefore essential to expand the applicability of the Linearized Reactive Flow approach towards realistic combustion conﬁgurations. As an alternative way, employing model order reduction to large systems can signiﬁcantly reduce computational cost. A topic that seems less challenging with the current state of the method is the treatment of acoustically non-compact ﬂames, as they often occur in high frequency transversal thermoa- Outlook coustic instabilities. No essential modiﬁcations or additions to the methodology presented in the scope of this thesis are needed to account for this phenomenon. As a result of future implementations, and based on the currently existing method, the investi- gation of the physics of perturbed ﬂames could be of great use to broaden the understanding of thermoacoustic instabilities. The Linearized Reactive Flow allows to vary the boundary condi- tions for thermal perturbations while keeping the mean ﬂow unchanged. This could be used to investigate the inﬂuence of ﬂame anchoring at a plate that behaves adiabatic or isothermal in terms of the perturbations, thus reﬂecting a negligible or inﬁnitely high thermal inertia of the plate, respectively. First numerical experiments in this direction showed that the excess of gain in the Flame Transfer Function could be tightly connected to the thermal boundary conditions. Beyond this rather simplistic approach, the perturbed heat conduction in the plate itself could be included in the linearized simulation, to closer model the actual physics. Due to the symmetric nature of the Fourier’s equation for heat conduction, the discretization with the Finite Element Method is straight forward and no stabilization is required. The modular nature of the method developed in this thesis – on the one hand due to its imple- mentation felicita X, on the other hand due to the state-space interconnect approach – lends itself to make additions to the functionality, while keeping ﬂexibility and compatibility of the sub-modules. This is an approach that has proven valuable in the past, as demonstrated by state- space based thermoacoustic network models. Thus, the approach can be deemed future-prove and enables further research in this area. Bibliography G. A. Jones and K. J. Warner. “The 21 st century population-energy-climate nexus”.

It is based on state-space models for coupling both the linearized acoustics and the ﬂame dynamics. The state space models for the acoustics are exported from COMSOL Multiphysics. The Finite Element Method for the linearized Euler equations yields very sparse system matrices. The acoustic and the ﬂame models are connected by network model routines. Due to the state-space modeling, thermoacoustic modes can be computed by solving a generalized non-Hermitian linear eigenvalue problem instead of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The Arnoldi algorithm is used to calculate selected eigenvalues in case the systems are too big to compute a direct solution for all the eigenvalues. Validation is carried out for a plenum-burner-chamber con- ﬁguration with four burners. Simplistic n-τ models are chosen for the ﬂame-acoustic interaction, which are represented in state space form utilizing an advection equation for representing the time delay. The results show good agreement with a full three-dimensional Finite V olume Helmholtz solver in mode shape, frequency and growth rates. Coupling between the plenum and the chamber is observed to be dependent on the interaction index and the characteristic time delay of the ﬂame models. 1. Introduction Premixed ﬂames in gas turbines are widely used, since they feature high efﬁciency paired with low emissions. However, they are susceptible to self excited thermoacoustic instabilities, which occur due to interactions between ﬂuctuating heat release of the ﬂame and acoustic waves. These waves are reﬂected by the combustion chamber walls. In the design stage, analytical and numerical methods can be used to predict the stability of a gas turbine. Compressible LES simulations are very expensive and thus low-order models are often utilized to predict stability. So called network models have become very popular, in which the acoustic behavior and the ﬂame-acoustic coupling are captured in modular blocks, which can be connected to build a complete thermoacoustic system. Though being very affordable, low-order models are mostly limited to quasi 1-D wave propagation, which often assumes azimuthal compactness of annular geometries. Models for more complex geometries are based on a modal reduction technique. The latter procedure requires a priori knowledge of the system, because the modal basis strongly inﬂuences the behavior of the deduced model. A different approach to thermoacoustic stability is the calculation of the system eigenmodes on a perturbation equation for describing the acoustics (e.g. Helmholtz or linearized Navier-Stokes equations). The ﬂame’s response to acoustic ﬂuctuations is typically accounted for by the fre- quency response of a ﬂame transfer function (FTF). Then the eigenvalue problem needs to be solved iteratively due to the nonlinear coupling of the FTF, which again leads to high computational cost. In this paper, a method for the efﬁcient stability analysis of gas turbine combustion chambers is introduced, which is based on state-space models for both the acoustic and the ﬂame response. No A.2 PAPER-EFFICIENT The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration a priori knowledge of the system acoustics is required, because the acoustic is only based on the governing equations deduced from ﬁrst principles instead of a modal reduction. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the methods for acquiring state-space models for the acoustic and the FTF, section 3 outlines the validation case setup. In section 4, the results for the validation case are presented. Section 5 concludes with a discussion and provides an outlook on the potential of this method. 2. State-Space Models State-Space Models are a compact and efﬁcient way to represent a set of linear coupled differential equations. The state vector x contains the states retained to represent the system. Matrix A and E describe the full dynamic of the system and B models the effect of the inputsu, see Eq. (1). Equation (2) deﬁnes an output-vector y, which is a linear combination of the states and the inputs, determined by the output-matrix C and the feedthrough-matrix D. Edx dt = Ax + Bu (1) y = Cx + Du (2) Time domain simulation is straight forward by discretization of the time derivative of x. From the Laplace-transfomred system, the in-/output transfer functions as well as the eigenvalues can be calculated. 2.01 Acoustic state-space model In this study, the linearized Euler equations (LEE) are employed for the acoustic modeling. Only the source term ˙q′ v for the unsteady heat release in the linearized conservation of energy, Eq. (5), is kept. ∂ρ′ ∂t + ∇ρ′·¯u + ρ′∇· ¯u + ∇¯ρ·u′+ ¯ρ∇·u′= 0 (3) ¯ρ∂u′ ∂t + ¯ρ(¯u ·∇)u′+ ¯ρ(u′·∇)¯u + ρ′(¯u ·∇)¯u + ∇p′= 0 (4) ∂p′ ∂t + ¯u ·∇p′+ u′·∇¯p+ γ(¯p∇·u′+ p′∇· ¯u) = (γ−1) ˙q′ v (5) Here, ¯(·) are the mean values and (·)′ are the acoustic perturbations. Equations (3) - (5) are spatially discretized using a Finite Element Method (FEM). Together with boundary conditions, a linear set of equations results from the FEM. Edx dt + Kx = L (6) Here, E is the mass matrix, K is the stiffness matrix and the load vector L contains entries which originate from Dirichlet boundary conditions and source terms. The state-vectorx contains the acous- tic variables at all spatial discretization points, which have not been eliminated by boundary condi- tions. The length NA of the state vector equals the degrees of freedom of the acoustic system. Equation (6) can be transformed to state-space representation by choosing A = −K and splitting the load vector in two factors, a matrix B with constant coefﬁcients and a vectoru which contains the time dependent input signals, e.g. unsteady heat release. By means of the output matrix C, the user can deﬁne output variables which are linear combinations of the states. These outputs can be chosen arbitrarily as they do not effect the dynamics of the system. 2 ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration ξ Φ(t= 0) Φ( t> 0) α Figure 1: Illustration of a signal Φ being advected along ξ. 2.02 Flame state-space model A ﬂame transfer function with a single time-lag, e.g. the n−τ model, represents a ﬂame that re- acts to an acoustic perturbation after a time-lagτ. A linear model for the time-lag, which is the crucial part of the n−τ model, can be derived e.g. by means of a Padé-approximation (). For increasingτ however, the Padé-approximation requires an increased number of coefﬁcients which become ill con- ditioned. The approach taken in this paper is the utilization of the 1 D advection differential equation to model the time-lag. ∂Φ ∂t + α∂Φ ∂ξ = 0 (7) In Eq. (7), the property Φ is transported with the constant advection speed α >0 in positive ξ direction (compare Fig. 1). Assume an advection along a ﬁxed interval of length T in ξ direction. Subsequently, the time τ it takes for a signal Φ to be transported is τ = T/α. For the n−τ model, a signal Φ is imposed at the upstream boundary (ξ = 0). At the downstream boundary (ξ = T), the time-lagged signal is measured and ampliﬁed by the factor n. To obtain the state-space form, the interval T is discretized in NF −1 elements of size ∆T by means of an upwind difference scheme which yields NF degrees of freedom. The input signal to this model is the acoustic velocity perturbation u′at a reference position, the measured output ˙q′ V is the time delayed input signal, ampliﬁed by the ﬂame-gain n. The states correspond to the advected property at the respective discretization nodes between the elements. Equations (8) and (9) illustrate a state-space model with NF = 4 degrees of freedom, discretized with a ﬁrst order upwind scheme. The input acts only on the ﬁrst state (upstream boundary), whereas the output vector C uses the last state only (downstream boundary). For this case, the coefﬁcients in A and B are a= α/∆T. dx dt =   −a 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 a −a      A x +   a    B u′ (8) ˙q′ V = [ 0 0 0 n ]    C x (9) By modeling the time-lag with an advection equation, a well conditioned, linear system in time- domain results. Using higher order upwind schemes or more discretization points increases the accu- racy of the model for higher frequencies. Figure 2 (left) shows the step responses for two models of order NF = 100 and NF = 30, both discretized with a third order upwind scheme. Slight under- and overshoots are observed close to the step. The higher order model has a steeper response, whereas the overshoot amplitude remains constant. However, for harmonic excitations, which are important in acoustics, the model performs excellent up to a certain frequency, which depends on the model order (Figure 2 (right)). As intended, the gain remains at a constant value of 1 up to a certain frequency, while the phase decreases linearly, which implies a constant time-lag.

The implementation of a linear FTF with multiple time-delays, which is the more accurate and generic way to describe the ﬂame-acoustic interaction, is also straightforward (). This allows for incorporation of FTFs which were measured from experiments or identiﬁed from CFD simulations. 2.03 Connection of state-space models For the validation case in this paper, the outputs of the acoustic system have been chosen to be velocity perturbations u′ at the ﬂame reference positions upstream of the heat release zones. The inputs to the acoustic system are the volumetric heat-release ﬂuctuations ˙q′ V in these zones, which appear as a source term in Eq. (5). The n−τ ﬂame model provides the time-lagged volumetric heat-release as a function of the velocity perturbations u′at the reference positions. The connection of the acoustic and the ﬂame models are accomplished using a state-space con- nection algorithm described in. This is done by feeding back the output of the acoustic system u′ to the input of the ﬂame system and vice versa with ˙q′ V. This way, a closed loop is created and the connected model has no more in- or outputs. Due to the linearity of both acoustic and ﬂame model, the resulting thermoacoustic model is also linear, which yields efﬁcient computations both in time- and frequency-domain. 2.04 Calculation of eigenmodes The connection of the acoustic and the ﬂame model yields a state-space model, which incorporates the complete thermoacoustic dynamics. The stability of this system can be investigated by solving for the eigenmodes. For smaller systems (up to N ∼3 ×104), it is feasible to directly calculate all the eigenmodes of the system. Due to limitations in memory and computational effort, only some modes of interest are calculated for bigger systems. In order to solve for modes around a speciﬁc shift-frequency σ, the generalized, non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem in Eq. (10) has to be solved, where σis the complex shift, λis the complex eigenfrequency and v is the right-eigenvector. (A −σE)−1 Ev = νv with ν = 1 λ−σ (10) The eigenfrequencies, which are closest to the shift, get moved close to zero. After inverting the problem, these are the eigenfrequencies ν with largest magnitude and can be found efﬁciently by the iterative Arnoldi algorithm. The eigenfrequencies λ of the original problem can then be computed with knowledge of the shift σ(Eq. (10)). 4 ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration 1.05 0.06 1.05 0.04 0.0195 Figure 3: Annular combustor cut through one burner, all measures in m.

The eigenvalue calculation is very efﬁcient, because the matrices obtained for the state-space models of the acoustic and the FTF system are very sparse, which speeds up the vector matrix products signiﬁcantly and requires little working memory. The system which was used to create the results of this paper consists of ∼203,000 states and requires ∼4 Gigabyte of RAM to solve for an eigenvalue. 3. Validation Case Setup The capabilities of the state-space method have been validated for a well researched plenum- burner-chamber conﬁguration. This simpliﬁed model of an annular gas turbine combustion chamber consists of a plenum and a chamber of equal geometry, connected by four burner ducts, see Fig. 3 for a cross-section through one burner. The acoustic-ﬂame interaction has been taken into account with n−τ models. V olumetric heat-release ﬂuctuations ˙q′ V of the ﬂames are assumed to be localized at the burner-chamber interface in a volume which amounts to 5 % of the duct volume. The conﬁguration has zero mean-ﬂow velocity and exhibits a temperature jump from 700 K in the plenum and the burners to 1800 K in the chamber. Further parameters can be found in Table 1 of. The numerical setup has been done in COMSOL Multiphysics. A tetrahedral spatial discretization with reﬁnements in proximity to the heat-release areas was employed. For this mesh with ∼225,000 Elements, a state-space model with NA ∼206,000 degrees of freedom was exported. The mesh size is similar to the A VSP mesh used in. All the boundaries were modeled as hard slip-walls and linear testfunctions were used. Note that in three dimensions, each node will result in 5 degrees of freedom (p′, ρ′, u′), but Dirichlet boundary conditions will eliminate some of these states. Conversion from non-dimensional to dimensional heat-release rate ﬂuctuations ˙q′ V,i for the i-th burner (Eq. (11)) is done through incorporating a constant factor in the output-matrix C of the ﬂame state-space system. ˙q′ V,i = γ¯p Si γ−1 niu′(t−τ) (11) Here, γis the ratio of speciﬁc heats, ¯pis the mean pressure and Si is the burner cross-section. For the mode calculation in this paper, the same nand τ were chosen for all four burners. 4. Results Validation of this method is carried out against the results of the Finite-V olume Solver A VSP reported in by comparing the azimuthal eigenmodes. Azimuthal modes appear in pairs with opposite rotational directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise), which can exhibit different eigen- frequencies. However, if the case is perfectly rotational symmetric, both modes become standing modes and coincide on the same frequency. Subsequently, these modes are called degenerate. The investigated plenum-burner-chamber conﬁguration features coupling between the azimuthal eigen- modes of the cold plenum and the hot chamber. The strength of this coupling depends, for a given n, on the time delay τ of the ﬂame model.

Figures 4 and 5 show the frequencies and the growth rates of the ﬁrst (WCC 1) and second (WCC 2) Weakly Coupled azimuthal Chamber modes. The indices 1 and 2 denote the ﬁrst and second mode of the azimuthal mode pair. Note that τ has been non-dimensionalized by the respective decoupled chamber mode time period τ1 0,C and τ2 0,C. The period times for the m-th chamber mode is given by Eq. (12), LC and c 0 are the half-perimeter and the speed of sound in the chamber. τm 0,C = 2 LC mc 0 (12) The increasing time-delay of the FTF changes the relative phase between the heat release and the acoustic velocity perturbations of the mode. For τ/τ0,C < 0.05, the interference between these perturbations leads to a net increase in perturbation energy. As neither damping mechanisms nor energy loss at the domain boundaries are present, the mode becomes unstable. With further increase in τ, the shift in phase angle leads to a destructive interference between heat release and acoustic pressure, the mode stabilizes and thus exhibits negative growth-rates. Both the WCC 1 and WCC 2 modes show this behavior. Very good agreement between the results of the state-space method and A VSP can be found for the WCC 1 mode. The two modes are degenerate and have identical frequencies and growth-rates.

However, the basic nature of the WCC 2 modes is present in both compared models: The ﬁrst WCC 2 mode exhibits pressure nodes at the burners and thus doesn’t excite any acoustic velocity perturbations in the burner ducts. Consequently, there is no inﬂuence of the time delay τ on this mode. The second mode (Fig. 6) right) strongly depends on the time delay of the ﬂame due to the pressure anti-nodes at the burners. 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 ·105 181.09 182.01 182.02 182.03 N Frequency [Hz] 1 1.05 2 2.05 3 3.05 ·105 1.04 1.045 1.05 Eigenfrequency Growth Rate 1 2 3 4 ·105 N computation time [s] linear ∼ N LEE Figure 7: WCC 2 eigenfrequency convergence (left, n = 1.057, τ/τ2 0,C = 0.025) and computation time (right) with increasing system order N. Computational efﬁciency and convergence are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the eigenfre- quency is only slightly mesh dependent for N >2 ×105. For simplicity, only the WCC 2 mode is shown. This convergence behavior is similar for all investigated modes and growth rates. The computation time for the eigenmodes scales linearly for small to medium systems, then takes a superlinear trend for larger N. Notice that all the computations have been carried out on a single core of a desktop PC. It is assumed, that a better scaling for large systems can be achieved by parallel processing. The calculation of an eigenmode using A VSP takes 5 to 30 minutes on 14 cores for a mesh containing ∼57,000 cells and depends on the thermoacoustic coupling between plenum and chamber. For strong coupling, convergence is signiﬁcantly slower. The same calculations for a state- space model with ∼206,000 degrees of freedom (∼225,000 cells in the FEM discretized mesh) take around 2 minutes. The presented state space eigenvalue solver has no convergence issues depending on the mode-shape or the coupling strength and shows superior performance because, compared to A VSP, no iterations for the ﬂame coupling are required. 5. Conclusion The gap in terms of computational effort and complexity between (analytical) low-order mod- els and very costly LES can be closed based on linearized acoustic equations. Following this idea, state-space models offer great efﬁciency and robustness when combined with very sparse system ma- trices, as obtained from discretized LEE or FTFs.

This paper shows how to extract scattering matrices utilizing linearized compressible ﬂow equations and provides a comparative study of diﬀerent governing equations, namely the Helmholtz, linearized Euler and linearized Navier–Stokes equations. A dis- continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method together with a two-source forcing is employed. With this method, the scattering matrix for a radial swirler of a combustion test-rig is computed and vali- dated against the results of a fully compressible Large-Eddy-Simulation. Analogously, the scattering behavior of an axial swirler is investigated. The inﬂuence of acoustic-hydrodynamic interactions, viscous eﬀects as well as unsteady boundary layers on the results is investigated for both conﬁgu- rations. A thermoacoustic stability analysis of the combustion test-rig housing the axial swirler is carried out, utilizing the scattering matrix of the swirler. Major inﬂuence of the reﬂections coming from the swirler on the thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies is found. Keywords: Scattering matrix; discontinuous Galerkin; thermoacoustic. 1. Introduction Under lean premixed operation conditions, required for low pollutant emissions, gas turbines are susceptible to thermoacoustic combustion instabilities, which arise due to an interaction of acoustic and hydrodynamic perturbations with the ﬂame. 1 When the ﬂow ﬁeld is per- turbed by acoustic waves, which are ubiquitous in gas turbines, the heat-release of the ﬂame oscillates, leading to unsteady volumetric expansion. This mechanism acts as a monopole source of sound. 2 When the generated acoustic waves are reﬂected back to the combus- tion zone, a feedback cycle establishes, which can become unstable, i.e. grow in amplitude. The high sound pressure levels as well as the oscillating temperature of the burnt gas are detrimental to stable operation and might even destroy the engine. Additionally, thermoa- coustic instabilities limit the operability and increase noise, pollutant emission and material wear.3 1850027-1 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027.

Meindl et al Due to the high cost of experiments, numerical simulations are an important comple- ment to investigate and predict instabilities. In order to achieve accurate predictions, the scattering and dissipation of acoustic waves in complex combustor geometries has to be captured. This is a challenging task, especially in the regions where signiﬁcant interaction between hydrodynamics and acoustics is present.4,5 Swirl generators are essential in gas turbines due to their support of stable combustion and improvement of the fuel–air mixing process. The resulting complex rotational ﬂow-ﬁeld featuring shear- and boundary-layers is an important zone, in which acoustic-hydrodynamic interactions take place.6,7 Eﬀects like acoustic-vorticity interaction similar to those at ori- ﬁces 8,9 and trailing edges 10 are expected to have a major inﬂuence on the acoustic trans- mission and reﬂection as well as dissipation behavior. Due to the proximity of the swirl generator to the combustion area, this interaction can impact thermoacoustic stability. 11 The development of reduced order models that can represent the eﬀect of such singularities in tools for thermoacoustic stability assessment is an ongoing process.7,12–14 It was already shown that accounting for a swirler directly in a Helmholtz solver, which neglects mean-ﬂow eﬀects, is insuﬃcient.13 Frequency dependent scattering matrices, which relate the plane acoustic waves at both sides to each other, are often employed for characterization of duct singularities in the plane wave region.15 Once determined, these acoustic two-ports can conveniently incorpo- rate the complex interaction between acoustics and hydrodynamics in transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients. Their deduction has been done experimentally,15–19 from nonlinear CFD 13,19–22 as well as by means of hybrid approaches.6,8,9,23–28 The latter is usually based on the computation of a steady-state or time averaged mean-ﬂow ﬁeld with Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) or Large-Eddy-Simulations (LES), respectively. Employing a linear perturbation ansatz to the governing equations around this mean-ﬂow yields linearized compressible ﬂow equations, from which the scattering matrix can be computed. Based on assumptions about the perturbed ﬂow, i.e. isentropic or inviscid, diﬀerent levels of detail and computational eﬃciency can be achieved. Due to the linearity of this hybrid approach, the computational eﬀort is signiﬁcantly lower than employing a nonlinear CFD simulation. While the pure CFD approach is pursued in the time domain, the hybrid methods typically take advantage of a transformation into the frequency domain, where the perturbed ﬂow ﬁeld can be evaluated with a single computational step for each frequency, which makes them well suited to compute a scattering matrix. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of diﬀerent linearized com- pressible governing equations within the hybrid approach on the scattering matrix of two swirlers. Special attention is put to the quantiﬁcation of viscous eﬀects, acoustic-vortex interaction and the augmentation of acoustic wave propagation by mean-ﬂow velocities. To this end, the scattering matrices of an axial and a radial swirler are computed with the linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSE), linearized Euler equations (LEE) and the Helmholtz equation (HHE). A discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (DG-FEM,29,30 derived for LNSE in Ref. 31) is applied to solve the LNSE and LEE, while a continuous approach is pursued for the HHE.

By com- paring the scattering matrices for the diﬀerent governing equations, the dominant physical eﬀects will be identiﬁed and the required level of modeling detail can be deduced. To quantify the impact of the acoustic scattering and dissipation by the axial swirler on thermoacoustic stability, the scattering matrix is implemented into a 1 D thermoacoustic network model.33 A linear stability analysis is conducted with scattering matrices obtained from the diﬀerent governing equations. Section 2 introduces the diﬀerent linearized compressible ﬂow equations employed in this study. The numerical method for computation of the scattering matrices based on FEM is presented in Sec. 3. A validation case for a radial swirler is conducted in Sec. 4. In the same manner, the acoustic scattering behavior is deduced for an axial swirl generator and the computed matrices are utilized in linear thermoacoustic stability analysis in Sec. 5, which is followed by a conclusion, Sec. 6. 2. Linear Acoustics In the mathematical modeling of aeroacoustic problems, the phenomena governing the prop- agation of acoustic waves are often assumed to be linear and the inﬂuence of small pertur- bations on the mean-ﬂow ﬁeld is neglected. This means, that the mean-ﬂow can inﬂuence the perturbations, but not vice versa. Applying these simpliﬁcations, linear time-invariant models that facilitate fast numerical computations can be derived. These models are then restricted to linear phenomena, like the onset of instabilities, and cannot represent the nonlinear interactions which dominate the ﬂow-ﬁeld when developed instabilities with high amplitudes are present. 2.01. Linearized compressible ﬂow equations Under the assumption of small perturbations, the Navier–Stokes equations can be linearized around a mean-ﬂow state. Therefore, the ﬁeld variables for pressurep,v e l o c i t yu and density ρ are separated into a steady-state mean ﬂow part (denoted by ¯· ) and time-dependent, ﬂuctuating quantities (denoted by ·′). The linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSE) in conservative form, which are employed in this study, read (without source terms): ∂ρ′ ∂t + ∂ ∂xj (¯ujρ′ +¯ρu′ j)=0, (1) ∂ ∂t(¯uiρ′ +¯ρu′ i)+ ∂ ∂xj (¯ρ¯uiu′ j+¯ρ¯uju′ i+¯ui¯ujρ′ − τ′ ij)+ ∂p′ ∂xi =0, (2) ∂ ∂t((ρE)′)+ ∂ ∂xj (¯uj(ρE)′ + (ρE)u′ j) − ∂ ∂xj ( ¯k∂T ′ ∂xj [ + ∂ ∂xj (¯ujp′ +¯pu′ j) − ∂ ∂xj (¯τiju′ i+¯uiτ′ ij)=0, (3) 1850027-3 J.

The ﬂuctuating temperature is calculated via the linearized ideal gas law, T′ = ¯T ( p′ ¯p − ρ′ ¯ρ [. (6) Note that the LNSE are the most general form of linearized compressible ﬂow equations, because the least assumptions and simpliﬁcations are made. The LNSE are therefore able to capture the damping eﬀects of acoustic and thermal boundary layers 34 as well as eddy generation and dissipation. The latter is important for acoustic characterization, because vortical structures can act as a secondary source of sound when interacting with solid surfaces. Neglecting viscous eﬀects and thermal conduction, i.e. ¯µ =0 a n d ¯k = 0, the linearized Euler equations (LEE) are obtained from the LNSE. This assumption is often employed in aeroacoustics because for most applications, the inﬂuence of viscous damping and heat conduction on the perturbation ﬁeld is minor. Assuming isentropic behavior, i.e. p′ =¯c 2ρ′, with the speed of sound ¯c, and neglecting mean-ﬂow velocities, i.e.¯u = 0, the LEE can further be reduced to the scalar wave equation, ¯ρ¯c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 − ∂ ∂xj ( 1 ¯ρ ∂p′ ∂xj [ =0. (7) After Fourier transformation, the wave equation is also known as Helmholtz equation (HHE). Extending the HHE to the convected Helmholtz equation, the correct propagation speed of the acoustic waves, which is the speed of sound augmented by the local mean-ﬂow velocities, can be accounted for. The LNSE/LEE formulations inherently represent this behavior. In the scope of this work, the standard HHE without accounting for mean-ﬂow velocities has been employed. While the LNSE and the LEE support the propagation of acoustic, vortical and entropy waves, the HHE can only describe the irrotational acoustic part of the ﬁeld. Therefore, all dissipation mechanisms for perturbation energy within the computational domain are omitted. 2.02.

This methodology has already been applied, e.g. for a transonic nozzle ﬂow.35 The conservation of energy contained in ﬁrst-order perturbations of the ﬂow ﬁeld according to Myers 32 reads (for a domain Ω bounded by Γ with the normal vector n): ] Ω ∂E′ ∂t dΩ+ ] Γ W′ i nidΓ= ] Ω D′dΩ. (8) Here, E′ is the perturbation energy, W′ i is the ﬂux in the ith coordinate direction and D′ is the source term.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (11) is the source term due to vorticity perturbations, while the second term is the interaction of perturbations with vorticity of the mean-ﬂow. The other terms are sinks due to viscous dissipation, both in the perturbed ﬁeld and by interaction of perturbations with mean- ﬂow shear- and boundary-layers. The evaluation of these terms allows the quantiﬁcation of diﬀerent loss mechanisms for a conﬁguration, giving insight into the validity of assumptions for the perturbed ﬂow, like inviscid or irrotational ﬂow. Although present in the LNSE, the source terms due to thermal diﬀusion and entropy waves have been neglected because these eﬀects are orders of magnitude smaller than viscous and vortical losses for the cases investigated in this study. 2.03.

Meindl et al Here, the plane acoustic waves f propagating downstream and g propagating upstream parallel to the x 1 axis are deﬁned as f = 1 ( p′ ¯ρ¯c + u′ [,g = 1 ( p′ ¯ρ¯c − u′ [. (13) The coeﬃcients of S govern the transmission and reﬂection behavior for upstream (Tud and Ruu) and downstream ( Tdu and Rdd) plane wave forcing via complex-valued coeﬃ- cients. These coeﬃcients also include the losses present in the system, e.g. due to acoustic- hydrodynamic interactions. This representation is not only useful to get physical insight, but also for implementation in low-order models, which are based on a plane wave descrip- tion of a whole system.33,36 An application to a thermoacoustic network model is discussed in Sec. 5.03.01. 3. Numerical Method The hybrid approach employed in this study to obtain scattering matrices is based on a time-averaged mean-ﬁeld from Large-Eddy-Simulations and subsequent solving of the compressible ﬂow equations presented in Sec. 2, linearized around this pseudo steady-state. The numerical scheme employed for the LNSE and LEE is the discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (DG-FEM) described in Ref. 31. In conjunction with the local Lax- Friedrichs ﬂux, a stable scheme for the convective terms is obtained, even for the nonviscous LEE. Numerous studies have shown high accuracy for DG-FEM applied to aero-acoustics, e.g. Refs. 29, 37–39. In the absence of convective terms, i.e. for the HHE, a standard FEM approach with continuous test- and ansatz-functions is used. A Fourier transformation of the linearized equations is employed which allows for direct evaluation of the matrix coeﬃcients in the frequency domain, signiﬁcantly reducing the computational eﬀort. Applying a two-source-location method, 23 i.e. acoustic plane wave forcing at the upstream and downstream end of the computational domain, the scattering matrix can be obtained from two computations at each frequency. This is done by retrieving the plane wave amplitudes exiting the domain, which are caused by the forced wave. The ratio of the outgoing and the forced wave amplitudes yields the scattering matrix coeﬃ- cients. Compared to a time-domain simulation, this is very eﬃcient because it requires only two matrix inversions per computed frequency. As a downside, the evaluated transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients are only valid for acoustic waves without growth rate. For small growth or damping rates however, the scattering behavior can be extrapolated in the com- plex plane, see Ref. 40. This is done by ﬁtting a continuous function to the transfer behavior computed at single frequencies. The derivatives of the resulting holomorph transfer func- tion in the direction of the imaginary and the real axes are then inherently coupled via the Cauchy–Riemann equations. This allows the extrapolation of the transfer function to complex frequencies away from the imaginary axis, i.e. for inputs with nonzero growth-rate. Linear stability of a system is often assessed by the computation of the eigenvalues. By employing the Laplace transformation and assuming harmonic oscillating time dependence, 1850027-6 J. Theor.

This stability analysis will be performed for the perturbed ﬁeld of the radial swirler, Sec. 4, to expand on the scattering behavior as well as for a thermoacoustic model of the whole combustion test-rig housing the axial swirler, Sec. 5. 4. Validation Case: Scattering Matrix for a Radial Swirler Swirl generators are an essential part of turbulent swirl combustors. The induced swirling ﬂow motion upstream of the turbulent ﬂame avoids blow-oﬀ of the ﬂame and allows thus a controlled combustion process. However, the complex geometry and ﬂow through swirlers also inﬂuence the scattering of acoustic waves in a nontrivial way. This study of the swirler is conducted with two objectives: First, to gain an understand- ing of the (aero-)acoustic phenomena present in the swirler, which lead to the acoustic scat- tering behavior. To this end, diﬀerent linearized compressible ﬂow equations are employed in a comparative study. Second, to derive a low order model, represented as scattering matrix, which can describe the transmission and reﬂection of plane acoustic waves at the swirler. This model may then be employed in 1 D thermoacoustic stability analysis to increase the accuracy with which instabilities can be predicted. Acoustic waves are partially reﬂected at the cross-section changes within a swirler. How- ever, accounting for this eﬀect only yields only a crude estimate of the overall scattering behavior as it neglects complex parts of the geometry and the mean-ﬂow interaction. When a longitudinal acoustic wave propagates through a swirler, the local swirl number is mainly modulated by two mechanisms: the acoustic wave perturbs the axial ﬂow veloc- ity and generates ﬂuctuations in tangential velocity due to interactions with the boundaries and the mean-ﬂow.11,41–43 The tangential perturbations are convected by the mean-ﬂow and therefore propagate slower than the acoustic wave. The spatial separation of these pertur- bations becomes more evident for increased distances between the swirler and the observer. The scattering matrix, which — in this study — is limited to describe plane acoustic waves, does not directly represent the convected tangential velocity ﬂuctuations. The energy transfer from the acoustics to the convected wave at the swirler however inﬂuences the gain. The tangential mean-velocity component leads to a rotation in the acoustic wave prop- agation. Due to the low circumferential Mach number and the short distance between the swirler and the outlet of the computational domain however, this eﬀect is negligible for the two swirlers investigated in this study. In fact, due to the circumferential averaging of 1850027-7 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.com by TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH on 04/01/20.

Meindl et al the acoustic wave leaving the domain at the in- and outlet, the rotation of the acoustic wave is not represented in the scattering matrix. The isolated computation of a swirler scattering matrix and the subsequent use in a 1 D thermoacoustic network model limits the interaction between the swirler and the rest of the modeled thermoacoustic system to plane acoustic waves. In particular, the interaction of hydrodynamic perturbations generated by acoustic forcing in the swirler with downstream components cannot be represented by this model. The model neglects, for example, that swirl perturbations might be convected to the combustion chamber and inﬂuence the ther- moacoustic oscillations due to interaction with the edges at cross-section changes. The direct inﬂuence on the ﬂame in terms of heat-release perturbation is however accounted for in the ﬂame transfer function. Before deducing the scattering matrix for an axial swirler and investigating its impact on the thermoacoustic stability of the combustor, see Sec. 5, the numerical methods applied are validated for a radial swirler geometry, see Fig. 1. The radial swirl generator bypasses the ﬂow through oﬀ-centered swirler vanes yielding a swirling ﬂow motion. For this swirler design validation data from a compressible LES is available. Consequently, the scattering matrices deduced from the linearized equations are compared against the results from the compressible LES. The compressible LES can be seen as a validation tool, as it directly resolves the transient, nonlinear acoustic-ﬂow interactions within the swirler geometry. This validation highlights the potential of the linearized equations for the acoustic characterization of complex geometries and puts any subsequent investigations on a solid basis. The radial swirler investigated is part of a turbulent swirl combustor test-rig, see Fig. 1, located at the EM 2 C, Paris.44 Upstream of the swirler, the cross-section area of the round duct section has a diameter D =0.022 m, the inlet velocity here is uin =5.4 m/sec.

In the test-rig the swirler is located upstream of the combustion zone and the mixture is not preheated such that the temperature within the swirler ﬂow is constantly equal to an ambient temperature of T = 293 K. This results in a density ofρ =1.204 kg/m 3 and a sound speed of c = 343 m/sec. 4.01.L E S The main idea of an LES is to directly resolve the larger turbulent structures and to model the small scaled turbulent motions. Whereas the larger turbulent structures often depend on the geometry of the conﬁguration studied, the small-scaled turbulence is more universal and can be modeled. The LES numerically solves the fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations which means that the hydrodynamics as well as the acoustics are fully described within the LES. The compressible LES is performed with AVBP 45 developed by CERFACS & IFPEN. Within the swirler geometry, the fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved on an unstructured grid 46,47 by using the Lax–Wendroﬀ scheme that is second-order accurate in time and space. Consisting of approximately 2 million tetrahedral cells, the unstructured grid has a maximum cell edge length of 0.07 mm and is reﬁned toward the wall. Subgrid stresses are modeled by the WALE model.48 Isothermal no-slip conditions with a tem- perature of T = 293 K are applied for all swirler walls. Nonreﬂective acoustic boundary conditions are prescribed at the in- and outlet of the computational LES domain by making use of the Plane-Wave-Masking technique.49 In order to deduce from LES values of the acoustic scattering matrix at discrete fre- quencies, acoustic forcing in form of a sine-sweep signal is induced at the inlet and the outlet of the LES domain. The sine sweep signal consists of seven mono frequent parts f = [200, 400,600,800,1000,1200,1400 Hz] that are concatenated. Every mono frequent part consists of eight periods. By imposing at the inlet of the LES an acoustic wave, gain and phase values of the transmission coeﬃcient from upstream to downstream Tud and the upstream reﬂection coeﬃcient Ruu can be computed. This is done by measuring the result- ing acoustic signals fd and gu and relating the amplitude and the phase of the signals to the forcing signal fu. The remaining two scattering matrix coeﬃcients may be deduced analo- gously by acoustically forcing the system from downstream, via gd. Note that this simple approach only works with nonreﬂecting boundary conditions. 4.02. Linearized compressible ﬂow In this section, the acoustic scattering matrix for the radial swirler is derived from linearized compressible ﬂow equations with DG-FEM. Therefore, the transmission and reﬂection coef- ﬁcients are obtained by solving the governing equations in the frequency-domain with a two-source method explained previously in Sec. 2.03. The investigated radial swirler exhibits a geometry, which allows to be divided into six identical ϑ =6 0◦ sectors due to cyclic symmetry, see Fig. 2. Assuming periodicity of mean and ﬂuctuating ﬁelds leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in computational cost. The mean 1850027-9 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027.

The axial, radial and azimuthal mean velocities are shown in Fig. 2. Inviscid and viscid linearized compressible ﬂow equations, namely HHE, LEE and LNSE, are employed. Boundary conditions for walls in the (aero-)acoustic computations are pre- scribed as adiabatic slip (niu′ i = 0) or no-slip (u′ = 0) walls. The no-slip boundary condition is forcing velocity ﬂuctuations to vanish at walls, which leads to the development of acoustic boundary layers, governed by viscous eﬀects.34 Therefore, in the (aero-)acoustic computa- tions, no-slip boundary conditions are only employed for the LNSE. On the upstream and downstream boundaries, the plane acoustic waves fu and gd are prescribed. Incoming vor- ticity and entropy waves are set to zero at the inlet. No boundary conditions for these convective waves are given at the outlet, which allows for propagation out of the domain without interference with the acoustic ﬁeld. For the subsequent computation of LEE and LNSE with DG-FEM, three diﬀerent meshes are employed, see Table 1. The ﬁne mesh for the periodic geometry is also shown in Fig. 1. The shortest acoustic wavelength at 1400 Hz is 0.0245 m, i.e. even the coarse mesh resolves this wave with more than 120 elements, guaranteeing mesh independence for the acoustics. The hydrodynamic boundary layer of the mean-ﬂow has an average thickness of 5 mm. The ﬁne mesh fully resolves this boundary layer and therefore captures its inﬂuence on the acoustics.50,51 The unsteady boundary layer δu = √ 2ν/ω forming on no-slip walls becomes very thin for increasing frequenciesω.52 Due to the high computational cost associated with Table 1.

Scattering matrix of the radial swirler The acoustic scattering matrices for the radial swirler deduced from LES, linearized com- pressible ﬂow equations with DG-FEM and HHE with continuous FEM, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3. The scattering behavior of the radial swirler is expected to be largely determined by reﬂection and transmission at the cross-sectional changes along the swirler. The gain in transmission for upstream excitation yields larger amplitudes than for downstream exci- tation, especially for HHE, where the magnitude exceeds one for low frequencies. This behavior is expected, because the area ratio between the inlet and outlet is larger than one and continuity equation constrains the mass turnover. The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients derived from LEE and LNSE yield convincing qualitative agreement compared to LES. The HHE can predict qualitatively the trend of the scattering coeﬃcients. However, qualitative errors of up to 25% arise compared to the LES results. For all coeﬃcients and frequencies, the HHE produces higher transmission and lower reﬂection coeﬃcients than LEE, LNSE and LES — only the reﬂection coeﬃcient Rdd for downstream forcing shows diﬀerent behavior. The reﬂection of an acoustic wave gd coming from the downstream end of the domain is strongly inﬂuenced by the vortices formed at the outlets of the oﬀ-centered swirler vanes. These vortices generate sound while being convected by the swirled mean-ﬂow,53 which partially contributes to the acoustic wave fd leaving the domain at the outlet. The propagation of acoustic waves through the sheared mean-ﬂow also generates losses of perturbation energy,54 which explain the overall signiﬁcantly lower reﬂection coeﬃcient obtained by the governing equations which account for these phenomena (LES, LEE and LNSE) compared to the HHE. Figure 4 clearly shows that the dominant loss term for the radial swirler is D′ Ω, which includes the formation and dissipation of vortical perturbations as well as the interaction of acoustic waves with vorticity in the mean-ﬂow. The viscous losses D′ τ, which occur in the LNSE computations, are of minor importance. The augmentation of the characteristic speed of acoustic waves through convection by the mean ﬂow is negligible for this conﬁguration, which shows in the fact that the phase diagrams for the scattering coeﬃcients are almost identical for all governing equations. The only noticeable deviation of the HHE results is in the frequency range of 200 Hz to 600 Hz in the downstream reﬂection coeﬃcient. As already discussed above, vortices strongly contribute to this mechanism, which are not described by the HHE. For an increased mesh resolution, the scattering matrix deduced by the LEE starts to deviate from the coeﬃcients computed with the LES, especially in the low-frequency range. Figure 4 shows vastly increased vortex perturbations, two orders of magnitude higher com- pared to the LNSE simulations. In order to further examine this behavior, the linearized compressible ﬂow equations are solved for their complex eigenmodes. The eigenvalues closest to the stability limit for LEE and LNSE on the mid-sized mesh are shown in Fig. 5(a). Two 1850027-11 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027.

Meindl et al unstable eigenmodes are discovered for LEE at 502.08 Hz and 624.05 Hz, which spoil the scat- tering matrix at frequencies close to the eigenfrequencies. On the contrary, all eigenmodes for LNSE are stable for the chosen mesh in the investigated frequency spectrum. Figure 5(b) shows eigenmodes in terms of the absolute radial velocity ﬁeld in a plane, perpendicular to the x-axis and cutting through the oﬀ-centered swirler vanes, again both for LEE and LNSE. For LEE the unstable eigenmode at 624.05 Hz is shown, whereas for LNSE a sta- ble eigenmode at 607.04 Hz is depicted. Here, the unstable eigenmodes are not damped by viscous eﬀects or no-slip boundary conditions in the vicinity of solid surfaces and lead to unphysical solutions. The high vorticity present in the unstable LEE eigenmodes leads to sound emission, which is predominantly leaving the domain at the downstream end. This explains the surplus gain of the coeﬃcients Tud and Rdd computed with the LEE on the medium mesh. Results of the LEE computations on the ﬁne mesh suﬀer even stronger from this instability and are therefore not shown. The coarse mesh does not show these problems, because the vortices in this region are not resolved well, which suppresses the instability. A similar observation was made by Kierkegaard et al for the whistling potentiality of an oriﬁce, where the employment of slip boundary conditions at the oriﬁce yielded “ an excessive amount of vorticity”.8 Carnevale et al state, that in the nonlinear, inviscid case, a vortex dipole impinging on a slip wall leads to a separation of the vortices, which will then slip along the wall without decaying.55 In the linearized case, i.e. the LEE, a vortex propagates with the mean-ﬂow only, which is not augmented by induced velocity of other vortices. Therefore, the vortex trajectory diﬀers from the nonlinear case, but it may still be assumed that no major decay mechanism for vortical perturbations is present at a slip wall. For no-slip walls in the nonlinear case however, vorticity with opposing rotation is generated in the boundary layer, when a vortex dipole approaches the wall.55 This behavior needs to be present in the linear LNSE computations as well, because it is required to fulﬁll the no-slip boundary condition. The results of the computations for the radial swirler suggest that no-slip boundary conditions are required for the correct interaction between vortices and solid surfaces in linearized compressible ﬂow computations. This also leads to a higher degree of consistency between the perturbed and the mean-ﬂow ﬁeld from LES, which was also computed with no-slip boundary conditions at the walls. If slip walls are enforced in the aeroacoustic com- putations, unphysical instabilities can develop in regions where strong interaction between vortices and surfaces occurs. When the LEE are employed in a thermoacoustic model of the full combustor, these unphysical vortical perturbations and the associated sound radiation may lead to erroneous growth-rate calculations. 5.

Meindl et al the two-source method to obtain the scattering matrix are equivalent to the radial swirler case. 5.02. Scattering matrix of the axial swirler Magnitude and phase of the obtained plane wave scattering matrix for the axial swirler are shown in Fig. 8. Consistently throughout all the coeﬃcients and frequencies, the HHE pro- duces higher transmission and lower reﬂection than the LEE and LNSE. The LNSE show lower transmission and higher reﬂection. The reason for this are the unsteady boundary layers, that constrict the ﬂow cross-section between the blades and are not represented by LEE and HHE. The eﬀect is similar to an increased area jump when the acoustic wave prop- agates through the blades of the swirler. This results in increased reﬂection and reduced transmission of acoustic waves. 52,56,57 For very high frequencies, the unsteady boundary layer becomes thinner.34,52 As already stated in Sec. 4.02, the mesh used could not resolve the unsteady boundary layers, especially at higher frequencies. Therefore, the unsteady bound- ary layer thickness is overestimated, which over predicts the eﬀect of the ﬂow constriction. In the frequency range of the thermoacoustic unstable mode around 100 Hz however, which will be shown in Sec. 5.03, the scattering matrix showed only minor changes when the grid was reﬁned near the no-slip walls. Under this premise, the scattering coeﬃcients of LNSE and LEE, which over predict and neglect unsteady boundary layers respectively, can be seen as upper and lower boundaries for the prediction of transmission and reﬂection of plane acoustic waves at the swirler. Compared to the phase of a 1 D duct, computed with convected HHE, all the governing equations yield larger phase lags for the transmission. This can partly be accounted to the longer path for the acoustic waves through the swirler geometry (HHE) and the inertia resulting from contractional acceleration. For the LEE and LNSE, the augmentation of the acoustic propagation speed by the locally resolved mean-ﬂow velocity yields a smaller phase lag for Tud with the ﬂow and an increased phase lag for Tdu against the ﬂow compared to the HHE. In contrast to the radial swirler, where vortical losses were dominant, the dissipation mechanisms in the axial swirler, Fig. 9, show that viscous and vortical dissipation are in the same order of magnitude. This is in agreement with the diﬀerent reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for LEE and LNSE, which also results from viscous boundary layer eﬀects. It is also apparent, that in the low frequency band below 200 Hz, vortical losses are overestimated by the LEE compared to the LNSE, which also leads to high viscous dissipation of the vortices. Above this frequency band, the viscous losses are rather independent of the forcing frequency and are higher for the LNSE. Figure 10 shows the absolute value of the perturbed axial velocity ﬁeld in a plane directly after the blades normal to the x 1-axis. It is clearly visible at 100 Hz (a)–(c), that high non- physical perturbation magnitudes at the outer bearing of the swirler occur, when LEE with slip walls are employed. This relates to the strong vortical eﬀects in the low frequency band, Fig. 9. Opposed to this, boundary layers form for the LNSE computation. Due to the neglect of the swirl in the mean-ﬂow ﬁeld, the HHE solution is turned slightly clockwise compared 1850027-16 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027.

Thermoacoustic network models Thermoacoustic models for linear stability analysis exist in a wide range from (semi-)analytical approaches (e.g. Refs. 58 and 59), to hybrid methods based on LNSE/LEE/HHE (e.g. Refs. 31, 60–63), which are applicable to complex geometries and model diﬀerent degrees of acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame interaction. Thermoacoustic network models (e.g. Refs. 33 and 64) are applicable if plane, 1 D acoustic waves are a suﬃcient represen- tation within the frequency range of interest, i.e. below cut-on frequencies of transversal modes. Due to the reduction in dimensionality, the computation of all eigenmodes of a network model takes only seconds. Network models rely on a decomposition and abstraction of the combustion system into simple 1 D two-port and one-port elements, for which analytical solutions of the convected HHE for propagation, transmission and reﬂection of the acoustic waves are known. Exam- ples are ducts with constant cross-section, acoustically compact area jumps and reﬂecting terminations. The latter is characterized by a complex-valued reﬂection coeﬃcient,R,t h a t relates the plane wave entering the domain to the outgoing wave. This would read Ru = fu gu and Rd = gd fd (16) for an upstream and downstream termination, respectively. The reﬂective behavior of the terminations is of great importance for system stability, as they can contribute major loss mechanisms of perturbation energy due to ﬂux over the system boundaries. In order to account for the acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame interaction, which cannot be resolved in a 1 D model, a so-called Flame Transfer Function (FTF, see e.g. Ref. 65) is often employed. For velocity sensitive ﬂames — as they are found in gas turbines — an appropriate ansatz for the FTF is to relate the heat-release ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ to axial velocity perturbations u′ ref 1850027-19 J.

By use of the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions,66 the unsteady heat-release is converted to acoustic plane waves, which are fed back into the acoustic part of the network model at the ﬂame position. In this study, the open-source thermoacoustic network toolta X 33,a is used for linear stability analysis. 5.03.02. Network model of the axial swirler test-rig A thermoacoustic network model (Table 2) proposed in Ref. 68 and extended by a perforated plate model for the outlet in Ref. 31 is utilized to investigate the linear stability of the turbulent swirl burner featuring the axial swirler (see Fig. 11). It consists of duct elements of constant cross-section for the plenum and the combustion chamber, which are connected via area jumps to the annular duct housing the swirler. The parts of the annular duct up- and downstream of the swirler are also modeled with duct elements ( D 1 and D 2). Note that in the original work of Emmert et al,68 the swirler is replaced by a lossless duct, i.e. the reﬂections and dissipation are neglected.

In the frequency band of interest between 50 Hz and 500 Hz, the reﬂection coeﬃcient is Rd ≲ −0.04, i.e. the perforated plate behaves like a partly reﬂecting open end. The frequency dependent FTF used in this study was identiﬁed from LES,65 see Fig. 12(a). In order to obtain a continuous model of the scattering matrices, which were sampled at discrete frequencies, a ﬁfth-order polynomial is ﬁtted to the scattering coeﬃcients. This continuous polynomial is then included in the network model in the position of the swirler element, see Fig. 11. The spectrum of the computed eigenvalues is shown in Fig. 13, left. A diﬀerence in oscillation frequency and growth-rate can be seen for the two cases applying the LNSE swirler scattering matrix versus a lossless duct. Note that the latter option is often employed due to lack of a better model, when an acoustic characterization of the swirler has not been conducted. The only unstable mode is at ∼ 100 Hz. Investigations have shown that this mode is not based on reﬂections of the acoustic waves at the domain terminations but on a direct intrinsic feedback from the sound generated by the unsteady ﬂame to the velocity perturbations at the reference position. 68,69 Note that the swirler has a major inﬂuence on this mode, because it introduces reﬂections exactly in this feedback path. The two modes at 1000 Hz, that are close to instability, have high pressure amplitudes in the annular duct housing the swirler. Again, strong inﬂuence of the scattering matrix especially on the growth-rates can be seen for these modes. The rest of the (already strongly damped) modes show only minor sensitivity for reﬂections from the swirler. The right part 1850027-21 J. Theor. Comp. Acout. 2019.027.

ITA eigenfrequency of the model used in Ref. 31 with resolved swirler and combustion chamber ( ). of the plot quantiﬁes the inﬂuence of the swirler scattering matrices obtained by diﬀerent governing equations on the unstable mode. For the scattering matrix with HHE, the main inﬂuence is the greater phase shift for transmission from downstream to upstream acoustic waves,Tdu, compared to the duct. Therefore, the feedback mechanism is slower and the oscillation frequency decreases. If nonnegligible reﬂections of upstream waves, Ruu,a r e present, as it is the case for the LEE and LNSE scattering matrices, the early feedback of reﬂected waves back to the reference position introduces a comparatively small time-scale to the eigenmode and thus the frequency increases. The lower amplitude in the transmission coeﬃcient Tdu, compared to a duct, contributes to a weaker overall feedback which leads to a smaller growth-rate of the mode for all swirler models. The diﬀerence between the inﬂuence of the scattering matrices (HHE/LEE/LNSE) is signiﬁcant, especially in terms of the growth-rate. Therefore, care has to be taken regarding the validity of assumptions for the ﬂow through the swirler, like neglect of unsteady boundary layers and mean-ﬂow inﬂuence. The result obtained for the unstable mode from the network model including the swirler is comparable to a stability analysis conducted in Ref. 31, where a part of the combustion chamber and the annular duct including the swirler were resolved with LNSE in 3 D, see Fig. 13, right. This shows, that the acoustic behavior of the swirler is a major inﬂuence in linear thermoacoustic stability analysis and is in the same order of magnitude like losses at area expansions and dissipative acoustic-ﬂow interactions in the combustion zone. 6. Conclusion Scattering matrices for a radial and an axial swirler have been computed by means of the Helmholtz, linearized Euler and linearized Navier–Stokes equations, respectively with a 1850027-22 J.

October 1, 2019 19:30 WSPC/S 2591-7285 130-JTCA 1850027 Acoustic Scattering Matrices from Linearized Compressible Flow Equations two-source methodology in the frequency domain. The discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element discretization was utilized to obtain a stable and accurate numerical scheme. Good agree- ment to the scattering matrix retrieved with a Large-Eddy-Simulation was found for the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The linearized Euler equations showed similar agree- ment for most frequencies, but featured unstable modes due to the interaction between vortices and slip walls. For the radial swirler, vortices have been found to be the main loss mechanism, while the scattering behavior of the axial swirler is governed by viscous and vortical eﬀects. The Helmholtz equation, which neglects mean-ﬂow acoustic interac- tion, overestimates the transmission in both cases. A linear 1 D thermoacoustic stability analysis of the combustor test-rig including the axial swirler was conducted. Taking into account the scattering matrices from diﬀerent governing equations signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the growth-rate of the unstable mode of the system, which leads to the conclusion that reﬂections coming from the swirler cannot be neglected.

Guasch Keywords: Discontinuous Galerkin State-space Eigenvalues Linearized Navier-Stokes Thermoacoustics abstract A hybrid approach for thermoacoustic stability analysis is formulated in a state-space frame- work. The approach distinguishes between regions of the computational domain with and without important interactions between acoustics and mean ﬂow or unsteady heat release, respectively. The former regions are modeled by a discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (DG-FEM) for the linearized Navier-Stokesequations in conservative form.The latter are represented by reduced-order models of acoustic wave propagation or dissipation, and provide complex-valued, frequency dependent impedance boundary conditions for the DG- FEM domain. The ﬂow-ﬂame coupling is modeled by a ﬂame transfer function that governs a volumetricsource term for the ﬂuctuating heat releaserate. The respective (sub-)models are formulated and interconnected in a state-space framework, whichfacilitates the monolithic formulation ofhybrid thermoacousticmodels.Moreover,the state-space interconnect framework makes it possible to formulate thermoacoustic stability analysis as alinear eigenvalueproblem– evenifﬂame transfer function or acoustic boundary conditions depend in a non-trivial manner on frequency. The approach is ﬁrst veriﬁed against analytical solutions for a duct with mean ﬂow across a thin heat source, similar to a Rijke tube.

Many industrial conﬁgurations, such as rocket engines or aero-engines as well as stationary gas turbines are subject to these instabilities. In particular, with the introduction of lean premixed combustion, gas turbines have become very susceptible to combustion instabilities. Limited operational range, increased emissions and even fatal damage to an engine are undesirablepossibleconsequences. Dueto thehigh costsanddiﬃ cultyofmeasurements inexperimental setups,analyticaland numerical investigations are the method of choice to assess thermoacoustic stability. High-ﬁdelity simulation of compressible, reactive, turbulent ﬂow requires high spatialand temporalresolution [1–3] and demandsvery signiﬁcant computationaleffort.

Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 1154312 ROMs range from low-order network models that make use of analytical solutions for simple elements such as ducts and area jumps [4–11], to methods for solving linearized 2 D/3 D compressibleﬂow equations [12–23]. Typically,ROMsforthermoacousticstabilityanalysisare hybrid methodsinasmuchastheydonotresolvetheﬂamedynamics. For example, the intricacies of vortex generation by acoustic waves or perturbations of ﬂame shape and the consequential modulation of ﬂame heat release rate [24–27] were not explicitly represented in the studies [4–21,28]. Instead, ﬂow-ﬂame interaction was taken into account by ﬂame transfer functions (FTF) based on analytical models, experimental or simulation data. Reliable prediction of thermoacoustic stability requires not only accurate representation of the ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic inter- actions that drive thermoacoustic oscillations, but also adequate models for other acoustic-hydrodynamic interactions that contribute to the balance of perturbation energy. For example, vortex shedding may occur whenever an acoustic wave propa- gates through a shearlayerinthe meanﬂow. Incombustors,shear layersareoften found betweenthe ﬂameand arecirculation zone, where theysupportstablecombustion.Viscousdissipationof vorticitythen resultsinanoverall reductionofperturbation energy. On the other hand, secondary sources of sound may emerge when vortical structures collide with a solid surface. Fur- thermore, non-uniformities of entropy(so-called“hot spots”or “entropy waves”)are typicallygenerated byinhomogeneities in thefuel/airmixturethatoccurwhenthemixingprocessisdisturbedbyacousticwaves.When accelerated(e.g.inadownstream nozzle), these hot spots generate acoustic waves that can contribute to an unstable thermoacoustic system [7,29–32]. A major challenge for ROMs based on the wave or Helmholtz equation lies in the reproduction of these interactions between acoustic waves and hydrodynamic phenomena. Fortunately, linear acoustic-hydrodynamic interactions are inherently taken into account by the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) [13–15,18–21]. This set of equations supports vorticity and entropy waves, which are convected by the mean ﬂow, as well as acoustic waves, which propagate with the speed of sound augmented bythemeanﬂowvelocity.Notethatthechangeofacousticpropagationvelocityandthecorrespondingchangesineigenfre- quencies are comparativelysmall for low Mach-numbers, the important meanﬂow effect is the transfer of perturbation energy between acoustic, vorticity and entropy waves that resultsfrom the interaction between perturbations and mean ﬂow. To conclude, it is crucial for thermoacoustic stability analysis to account for ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions that generate perturbation energy. This can be achieved, forexample, with anaccurate ﬂame transfer function. Moreover, it is equallyimpor- tantthatacoustic-hydrodynamicinteractions,suchasvortexsh eddingordissipation,betakenintoaccount inorderto properly balance generation against losses of perturbation energy. Provided that mean ﬂow ﬁelds are available—typically generated by computationalﬂuiddynamics—the LNSEframeworkrepresentstheseinteractionsfromﬁrstprinciples,whichmotivatestheuse of the LNSE as the basisfor the modeling approachpresented in this study. The ﬁnite element method (FEM)is oftenemployedto discretize the aeroacousticgoverning equationsin nontrivial geome- tries [13–16,18–21]. Advantages over the ﬁnite volume and ﬁnite difference methods are the straightforward extensibility to higher order schemes (p FEM) and the applicability to unstructured meshes. On the other hand, a major challenge lies with the discretization of the convective terms of the aeroacoustic governing equations, which is numerically unstable if standard, continuous basis functions are applied. In the last decades, discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element methods (DG-FEM) have become popular as a numerical approach to discretize linear and non-linear partial differential equations (e.g. Ref. [34–36]), especiallyforconvectivelydominatedproblems.Forthis type ofproblemsthe DGmethod hasshownto constituteaframework in which stable numerical schemes canbe derived that feature high accuracy and convergence potential due tohp convergence [37–41]. In this paper, a DG-FEM method for the compressible LNSE is formulated following the discretization approach of Baumann and Odenfor the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstratebymeans ofcomparisonwith semi-analyticalsolu- tions for a simplistic model of a Rijke tube that this discretization leads to highly accurate numerical results—in contrast to a well established method employing a streamline upwind/Petrov Galerkin ansatz. Other than previous implementations in thermoacoustics [18–21], we keep the LNSE in conservative form. This eliminates the need for an explicit evaluation of mean ﬂow gradients on the FEMgrid and thereby avoids inconsistencies that might emerge from that procedure. E v e n t u a l l y,i nc o n t i n u a t i o no fp r e v i o u se f f o r t si no u rg r o u p, the discretized DG-LNSE models are integrated in a seamless manner into a “state-space interconnect” framework for thermoacoustic stability analysis. Following the established hybridapproachforthermoacousticproblems,ﬂow-ﬂameinteractionisaccountedforbyan FTFthatrelatesavolumetricsource term, resulting from ﬂuctuating heat release of the ﬂame, to the upstream acousticvelocity at earlier times. Fundamentally,thermoacousticsystemswithatime-delayedhea tsourcerepresentanonlineareigenvalueproblem(NLEVP). The non-linearity emerges from the representation of time delay terms in the Laplace domain, which results in matrix coeﬃ- cientsthatdependontheeigenvalue,evenifthegoverning equationspersearelinear.State-of-the-artmethods[ 12,44]employ ﬁxed-point iterations to compute one eigenvalue at a time. Whether a given eigenvalue is actually found depends on the initial guess of the iterative solver, on the basin of attraction of the eigenvalue sought, and on the proximity of other eigenvalues, as highlighted in a recent paper by Buschmann et al. The number of iterations required for convergence also depends on these factors. In some circumstances, converging to a given eigenvalue is near impossible unless a priori knowledge of its loca- tion in the complex plane is available.Fortunately, the state-space approach facilitatesa representation of time delaysin terms of an advection equation. At the expense of a moderate increase in the number of degrees of freedom, the time delay can be discretized with suﬃcient accuracy for the frequency range of interest. This leads to models that do not explicitly depend on the frequency, such that a linear eigenvalue problem is obtained. For small to moderate problem sizes, such linear eigenvalue problems may be solved non-iteratively for multiple eigenfrequencies and without the hazards that come with initial guesses. Overall, signiﬁcantly reduced computationaleffort may result. A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 3 M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 115431 With the state-space interconnect framework, parts of the conﬁguration where acoustic-ﬂow or ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic inter- actions are not important may be represented by low order thermoacoustic network models, which provide complex- valued,frequency-dependent impedanceboundaryconditionsfo r the LNSE domain.Again, incontrast tostate-of-the-art meth- ods, any time delays in the impedance boundary conditions are discretized utilizing an advection equation, which eliminates the explicit dependence on frequency and results in a linear eigenvalue problem. Further signiﬁcant reductions in computational effort and increased ﬂexibility in modeling complex (thermo-)acoustic systems may be realized in this way, as demonstratedin the second validationcase presented in this paper.

The paper is structured as follows: in the next section, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations in conservative form and the discretization with DG-FEM are presented. State-space modeling is introduced as a uniﬁed framework for thermoacoustic simulations in section 3, and it is demonstrated how the DG-FEM model is interconnected to impedance and ﬂow-ﬂame inter- action models. Section 4 is concerned with validation of the DG-LNSE method against analytical solutions for a 1 D duct case with and without unsteady heat release by comparison of eigenvalues. In section 5, the thermoacoustic stability of a turbulent swirl burner is assessed, employing interconnected state-space models originating from DG-LNSE, network model, FTF and a frequency dependent impedance boundary condition at the burner outlet. The paper concludes with a summary of the results and provides limitations as well as an outlook.Details on the vector/matrix notationof the LNSE arepresented in an Appendix. 2. Discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations The ﬂow perturbations considered in aeroacoustic simulations are often assumed small compared to mean ﬂow quantities. Based on this assumption, a linearization of the governing equations around a steady-statemean ﬂow can be employed. The resulting linear system of equations requires signiﬁcantly less effort to solve than the full non-linear equations. In addition, various simpliﬁcations can be imposed on the linearized equations, e.g. isentropic or non-viscous ﬂow. In the general case, however, the full Navier-Stokes equations are the basisfor the linearization. 2.01. Linearized Navier-Stokes equations The primitive ﬂow ﬁeld variables(pressurep,v e l o c i t yui inxi direction and Temperature T) 𝚽(xi,t)= ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜⎝ p ui T ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟⎠, i = 1…3, (1) can be separated into a mean ﬂow ﬁeld 𝚽(xi) that satisﬁes the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations and unsteady ﬂuctuations 𝚽′(xi,t): 𝚽(xi,t)= 𝚽(xi)+ 𝚽′(xi,t) (2) Inserting this ansatz into the Navier-Stokes equations and assuming small perturbations𝚽′, all except the linear terms in the ﬂuctuating variables can be omitted. This yields the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) in conservative form. Only the followingassumptionshavebeenmade:idealgas,Newtonianﬂuida nd Stokes’hypothesisfortheviscousterms.Viscousheating in the linearized energy conservation equationis neglected: 𝜕𝜌′ 𝜕t + 𝜕 𝜕xj ( uj𝜌′ + 𝜌u′ j ) = 0, (3) 𝜕 𝜕t ( ui𝜌′ + 𝜌u′ i ) + 𝜕 𝜕xj ( 𝜌 uiu′ j + 𝜌 uju′ i + ui uj𝜌′ ) + 𝜕p′ 𝜕xi = 𝜕𝜏′ ij 𝜕xj, (4) 𝜕 𝜕t (𝜌e)′ + 𝜕 𝜕xj ( uj(𝜌e)′ + (𝜌e)u′ j + ujp′ + pu′ j ) = 𝜕 𝜕xj ( k 𝜕T′ 𝜕xj ) + ̇q′ V, (5) with the thermal conductivityk and the volumetric heat release perturbationṡq′ V. This source term is of prime importance in thermoacoustics as it constitutes the inﬂuence of the unsteady heat release on the perturbation ﬁeld. A closure model that relateṡq′ V to the perturbation variables of the LNSE is discussed in section 3.06. The terms containing the total mass-speciﬁc energye areexpressed in terms of the primitive variablesand the ratio of speciﬁcheats𝛾 via (𝜌e)= p 𝛾 −1 + 𝜌 uk uk 2, (𝜌e)′ = p′ 𝛾 −1 + uk uk𝜌′ 2 + 𝜌 uku′ k. (6) M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 1154314 The viscous stresses are deﬁned via Stokes’ hypothesis as 𝜏′ ij = 𝜇 ( 𝜕u′ i 𝜕xj + 𝜕u′ j 𝜕xi − 2 𝜕u′ k 𝜕xk 𝛿ij ) (7) with the dynamicviscosity𝜇and the Kronecker-Delta𝛿ij: 𝛿ij ≡ { 1 f o ri = j, 0 e l s e. (8) This set ofequations canbe closed with the linearized equationof statefor anidealgas, T′ T = p′ p − 𝜌′ 𝜌, (9) which yields the ﬁve unknownsp′,T′ andu′ i withi = 1…3 in three dimensions. Fluctuations in entropys′ canbe derived via s′ = cp T′ T −R p′ p, (10) where cp is the isobaric speciﬁc heat capacityand R is the gas-constant of the medium. Following Baumann and Oden,the LNSE can beformulated in vector notationsimilarly to the Navier-Stokes equations: M 𝜕𝚽′ 𝜕t + 𝜕Fj(𝚽′) 𝜕xj = 𝜕Fv j (𝚽′) 𝜕xj +S. (11) M isamatrix containingthemeanﬂowprefactorsofthetimederivativeterms, Fj and Fv j are the non-viscous and viscousﬂux in direction xj, respectively.S contains the ﬂuctuating heat release source term for the linearized conservation of energy. Further details on the vector notation is given in the Appendix. 2.02. Discontinuous Galerkin FEM Assuming isentropic perturbations and neglecting the mean ﬂow velocities as well as viscous effects, the wave equation can bededucedfrom the LNSE.Many numericalschemesare wellsuitedtosolvethe waveequation,e.g.the standardﬁniteelement o rt h eﬁ n i t ev o l u m em e t h o d( F V M ). However, when mean ﬂow velocities are taken into account, the application of a standard, unstabilized ﬁnite element method with continuousbasis functions leads to a numerically unstable discretization scheme in cases with high cell Péclet numbers. The reason for theinstability is as follows: symmetric test functions that span theneighboring elementsofanodeleadtoadiscretizationsimilartoacentraldifferenceschemeoftheﬁnitedifferencemethod. It is known that for convection dominated problems, this scheme introduces negative numerical diffusivity, which may exceed the physical one and thus result in unstable behavior. To remedy this situation, a number of stabilized ﬁnite element methods have been developed. Two well-known approaches are the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin method (SUPG), which introduces additional numerical viscosity in streamline direction and the Galerkin Least Squares (GLS) formulation, which minimizes the error of the residuum in a least squares sense to produce stable solutions. Both approaches require a stabilizationparameterthat controls the weighting of the correction terms in the weak form. An exact analyticalexpressionfor thisparameterisingeneralnotknownforthe LNSEinthree dimensions,itisthusoftenchosenbasedonthecharacteristicwave speed,the cellsize and acase-dependent pre-factorthat isa priori unknown.Ithas been shown thatthe growth rates of thermoacoustic eigenmodes depend onthe choice ofthis parameter.The parameterhas beenvaried over several orders of magnitude between𝛼𝜏 = 1.00·10−3,𝛼𝜏 = 1.000 a n d𝛼𝜏 ∈[ 0,50] for different applicationcases. The problem of the symmetric discretization of the convectivet e r m sc a nb ea v o i d e db yt h eu s eo fb a s i sf u n c t i o n st h a ta r e discontinuous at the mesh nodes and only span one element. This makes non-symmetric discretization possible. The discon- tinuous Galerkin method has been applied to aeroacoustic problems of sound propagation, where excellent performance was observed. This suggests the applicationto thermoacoustic problems,where the aeroacousticsis a crucialpartofthe model. Incontrasttothecontinuous FEM,thediscontinuousnatureofthediscretizationdoesnotallowtheintegrationofthegovern- ing equations overthe whole domainwhen deriving the weak form. Instead,anelement-wise derivationis pursued. A partition h of the computationaldomainΩwith outer boundary∂Ω = Γinto N(h)non overlapping elementsΩe is employed, Ω= N(h)⋃ Ωe∈h Ωe. (12) The union of all element boundaries∂Ωe consists of the true outer boundaryΓof the domain as well as the internal boundaries between the elements,ΓInt. The outer domain boundary is separated into Dirichlet and Neumann partitions,ΓD and ΓN.W i t h V(h)being a spaceof nodal discontinuous trial functions, the solution vectoris sought from this space, 𝚽′ = ( Φ′ 1,…,Φ′ ), Φ′ i ∈ V(h). (13) A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 5 M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 115431 Duetothe discontinuousnatureofthe trialfunctions,twosolutionvaluesarepresent atinternal boundaries,onewithin thecell under consideration,𝚽′−, as well as the value of the neighboring cell,𝚽′+. For ease of representation, the following shorthand notations for any two quantities at opposing sides of internal boundaries are introduced as the average and jump operator, respectively: < () >= () − +() + 2, [( )] = ( )− −() + (14) Multiplicationof Eq. (11)with a vector of discontinuous test functions from the samespace V(h)as the trial functions W = ( w 1,…,w 5 ), wi ∈ V(h) (15) and element-wise integration over the domainΩ= ∑ Ωe∈h Ωe yields the variational formulation of the LNSE. Subsequent inte- gration by parts constructs the form required for the discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method. From this step, the non- viscous ﬂux Fn = Fjnj as well as the viscous ﬂux Fv n = Fv j nj = Dn𝚽′ normal to the element boundary∂Ωe with outward facing normal vector componentsnj arises. The weak form of the LNSE in vector notation, again following Baumann and Oden, reads: ∑ Ωe∈h ∫Ωe WT M 𝜕𝚽′ 𝜕t dx + ∑ Ωe∈h ∫Ωe 𝜕WT 𝜕xj ( Fv j −Fj ) dx + ∑ Ωe∈h ∫𝜕Ωe WT F⋆ n ds +∫ΓInt ( < WT DT n > [𝚽′] −[ WT ] < Fv n> ) ds + ∫ΓD ( WT DT n𝚽′ −WT Fv n ) ds = ∑ Ωe∈h ∫Ωe WT Sdx + ∫ΓD WT DT n ̃𝚽′ds + ∫ΓN WT̃Fnv ds, (16) where ̃𝚽′ and ̃Fv n areknown valuesof Dirichlet and Neumann boundaryconditions, respectively.The linearized Eulerequations can be retrieved from the LNSE by neglecting the viscous ﬂux Fv n. Details on the ﬂux formulations and their use to impose boundaryconditions in the weak form are given in Appendix A. Bychoosinganappropriatenumerical non-viscous ﬂux F⋆ n oninternalboundaries ΓInt,similarto FVM, astablediscretization can be obtained. Thus, the DG-FEM approach is often referred to as a hybrid FEM/FVM method that combines the advantages of both approaches. Due to the choice to represent the solution with discontinuous trial functions, the numerical ﬂux betweenelementsmaydependonthe solutionsonbothsidesofthe e lementboundary.Itishighlydesirabletointroducealocal ﬂux,i.e.aﬂuxformulationthatonlydependsonthesolutionoftheadjacentcellstotheelementboundary,inordertoguarantee a very sparse equation system after discretization. Furthermore, we seek a formulation that is inherently numerically stable, independent of the time-stepping scheme. This second requirement arises from the need of computations in the frequency as well asthe Laplacedomain.Forthis study,the local Lax-Friedrichs ﬂux hasbeenchosen, whichblendsbetween acentral andan upwind ﬂux, based on the parameter C : F⋆,LF n =<Fn > +C [ M𝚽′]. (17) Setting C equal to the maximum characteristic wave speed normal to the boundary of two neighboring elements results in a stable scheme. For the LNSE, the characteristic propagation velocities are deﬁned by the speed of sound c = √ 𝛾R T in the meanﬂowﬁeldandthemeanﬂowvelocities.Themaximumvalueresultsifanacousticwavepropagatesinmeanﬂowdirection, which implies: C = c +|| uini||. (18) This expression for the parameter C is physicallymotivated and known before runtime, as it only depends on the mean ﬁelds. The viscous ﬂux on internal boundaries, compare Eq.(16),is discretized with a scheme ﬁrst presented by Babuˆska et al for pure diffusion problems. This scheme was also applied to convection-diffusion problems a sw e l la st h e N a v i e r - S t o k e s equations.The schemeiselement-wise conservative,doesnotrequire ahybridbasisfunctionapproachandleadstoablock diagonalmass matrix with uncoupled blocks. A problem emerging due to the perturbation ansatz is the need for steady-state mean ﬂow ﬁelds as a basis for the LNSE. The interpolation of mean ﬁeld variables 𝚽 from a highly resolved large eddy simulation (LES), say, to a more coarse mesh as typically used in aeroacoustic computations gives rise to inconsistencies: Spatial derivatives of 𝚽 can be obtained either by interpolation of the gradients computed on the LES mesh, orby evaluation on the computational aeroacoustic (CAA) grid based on the interpolated mean ﬁeld variables. The derivatives obtained by these approaches will in general differ. This effect contributes to the mesh dependence of CAA results. The advantage of integration by parts of the conservative formulation shows in the fact that no explicit evaluation of spatial derivatives of the mean ﬁeld variables is required. This contributes to high reliability in the prediction of thermoacoustic instabilities, especially regarding the correct representation of dissipation mechanisms. The described DG-LNSE method has been implemented within the commercial FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.03. Throughout this study, a numerical quadrature of the ﬂux terms with order adapted to the highest polynomial degree ofthe integrand is employed to ensure accurate integration. M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 1154316 3. Thermoacoustic state-space modeling A wide range of models for thermoacoustic stability analysisexists. The DG-FEM model based on the LNSE presented in the previous section describes propagation and dissipationof acoustic waves in the presence of mean ﬂow (and mean temperature gradients), but does not resolve the response of a ﬂame to acoustic perturbations and the ensuing ﬂuctuations of heat release rate, which generate sound. In other words, a closure model for ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interaction is required. Additionally, non- trivial boundary conditions such as impedances that depend on frequency, are often required, e.g. for up- and downstream boundaries of a combustion chamber or damping devices. In order to couple models for unsteady heat release rate and non- trivialboundaryconditionstoa DG-FEMmodel,aunifyingreprese ntationisdesired.Arobustande ﬃcientframeworkforlinear, time-invariant systems, which also facilitates coupling of sub-models, is the state-space formalism. Indeed, a variety of state- spacemodels for thermoacoustic stabilityanalysishave been proposedand employedin several prior studies [9,55–59]. The following sections focus on the representation of the various elements of a thermoacoustic model in state-space form withthegoalinmindofretainingalineareigenvalueproblem.Thisincludesthe DG-FEMmodel,theﬂametransferfunctionthat connects the ﬂuctuating heat releasetoacousticperturbations,aswell asnon-trivial acousticboundaryconditions.The connec- tion of these models creates a monolithic state-space/DG-FEM (ss DG) model which comprises the complete thermoacoustic dynamics. 3.01. State-space representation State-space models are a well researched, ﬂexible and robust representation of coupled, linear, ﬁrst order ordinary differen- tial equations in time. The generalized formulation reads E dx(t) dt = Ax(t)+ Bu(t), (19) y(t)= Cx(t)+ Du(t). (20) The time-dependent state-vectorx(t) contains N unknown variables,u(t) and y(t) are vectors of in- and outputs respectively. Due to the constant coeﬃcient matrices A to E, state-space models are linear time-invariant (LTI). Equation(19) is called the system equation and determines the autonomous dynamics of the system through the mass matrix E and the system matrix A,a sw e l la st h ei m p a c to fi n p u t su(t) on the system via B. Equation(20) deﬁnes the outputsy(t) as linear combinations of the states x(t) and the inputsu(t) through the output matrix C and the feed-through matrix D. Note that for a single system, the output equationdoes not contribute to the systemdynamics and can therefore be chosen to deﬁne any outputs. 3.02. Eigenvalue computation in the Laplace domain Weassumethataquantity a(t)inthetimedomainbehaveslikeaharmonicallyoscillating,exponentiallygrowingordecaying signal, i.e. a(t) → ̂a(s)est. (21) Here s = sr + isim is the Laplace variable with the growth ratesr as the real part and the oscillationfrequencysim as the imag- inary part. The hat̂() denotes a complex amplitude. When applied to a state-space model, a system that is linearly dependent on s is retrieved, Eŝx(s)= Âx(s)+ B̂u(s), (22) ̂y(s)= Ĉx(s)+ D̂u(s). (23) Based on this state-spacesystem in the Laplace domain, the eigenvalues can be computed, which is a common approach to linear thermoacoustic stability analysis. The system is called linearly stable if all eigenvalues have a negative real part,sr < 0, i.e. the eigenmodes decay in amplitude. For state-space models with a moderate number of degrees of freedom,N ⪅ 104,s a y, the full set of eigenvalues can be computed non-iteratively in one single computation, e.g. by means of the QR algorithm. For largersystems,this isnot feasibledueto excessivememorydemands.Instead,assumptionsaboutthefrequency rangein which instabilities might occur are made. Then, a number of eigenmodes are computed in the vicinity of complex shift frequencies 𝜎 = 𝜎r + i𝜎im. The implicitly restarted iterative Arnoldi algorithm may be employed to solve the shift-and-invert eigenvalue problem for a state-spacesystem, until a set number of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are converged within a given tolerance: (A −𝜎E)−1 Êv = 𝜈̂v with 𝜈 = 1 s −𝜎. (24) The complex-valued eigenvectorŝv(s)ofthe statevariables correspond to the shapeof the eigenmode. Inordertosolve Eq. (24),thisstudyemploysan LUdecompositionof (A − 𝜎E)inalowerandanuppertriangularmatrixwith the parallel direct solver MUMPS, which is well suited for sparse systems as they typically result from FEM discretization. A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 7 M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 115431 Note that the state-space method does not necessarily rely onthese algorithms, both the iterative Arnoldi as well as MUMPS could be replaced by other suitable methods. On the other hand, if the ﬁxed-point iteration method is employed for a NLEVP, an outer loop is added to this procedure because the system matrices explicitly depend on the eigenvalue. For every iteration (around 25 per eigenvalue, as reported by Buschmann et al ), the matrices have to be reconstructed and newly factorized. Conversely, iftime-delaysare discretizedin orderto obtaina lineareigenvalue problem,only onedecompositionof (A − 𝜎E)– which is the maincomputational effort for large systems – is required. As an alternative to the state-spaceapproachor ﬁxed-point iteration, Beyn’s method of computing the eigenvalues in a given region of the complex plane can be employed.By means of a contour integration, it is ensured that all eigenvalues within this region are indeed found, without the hazards of initial guesses. The contour integral is computed by numerical integration, utilizing several sampling points on the chosen contour. For example, Buschmann et al report the use of 256 sampling points for a thermoacoustic system. The completeness of eigenvalues comes at the cost of multiple solutions of linear systems with dimensionality of the original problem on the contour. Additionally,one is advised to conﬁrm that eigenvalues are indeed actual solutions of the problem by employing a small number of ﬁxed-point iterations on the results of the contour integration. 3.03. Discretized DG-FEM models The spatial discretization of the LNSE using the DG method as detailed in section 2 leads to a linear system of ordinary differential equations: E d𝚽′ h(t) dt +K𝚽′ h(t)= L(t). (25) E is the mass matrix,K is the stiffness matrix,L is the load vector and𝚽′ h(t) contains the unknowns𝚽′ at the mesh nodes. The generationof the state-spacesystem,Eq.(19),from (25)is straight forward: We choosex(t)= 𝚽′ h(t),A =− K andthe load vector L(t)issplitintoamatrixwithconstantcoeﬃcients B andavectorcontainingthetime-dependentinputsignals u(t).These input signals emerge from the inhomogeneous terms of the LNSE, e.g. boundary conditions or source terms. As stated before, Cand D can be chosen arbitrary without changing the system dynamics. Section 3.07 will show that an appropriate choice of outputs of the LNSE state-space model will facilitate coupling to an FTF on the one hand and to network models for non-trivial acousticimpedanceboundary conditions on the other. 3.04. Network modeling Network-models, alsocalled characteristicwave models,aremodular,1 D toolsthat allowinexpensive thermoacousticanal- ysis. The method is based on elements for which the acoustic transmission and reﬂection behavior of characteristic waves is known from analytical expressions. Some examples are ducts, area jumps or (partially)reﬂective terminations. By combination and connection of multipleelements, a full thermoacoustic systemcan bemodeled [4–11]. All elements except for ducts are treated as acoustically compact and do not need spatial discretization. The wave propa- gation in ducts is governed by the 1 D convected Helmholtz equation with constant mean ﬂow velocity. An analytical diago- nalization of the convected Helmholtz equation yieldstwo advection equations for the acoustic plane wavesf and g with the characteristic velocity u + c and u − c, respectively, f = 1 ( p′ 𝜌 c +u′ ), g = 1 ( p′ 𝜌 c −u′ ), (26) 𝜕f 𝜕t +( u + c)𝜕f 𝜕x = 0, 𝜕g 𝜕t +( u − c)𝜕g 𝜕x = 0. (27) Theseequationsareonlycoupledatspeciﬁclocations,i.e.the“ nodes”ofthenetworkmodel,whichrepresentboundariesorduct singularities such as area jumps or changes of the speciﬁc impedance of the mean ﬂow. In ducts with constant cross-sectional area and mean ﬂow however, they can be treated separately. Higher order ﬁnite difference upwinding schemes are employed for the spatial discretization of the advection equations forf and g in the thermoacoustic network toolta X. Due to the nature ofthe advectionequation(ﬁrstorderintime,LTI),thesemi-discrete,spatiallydiscretizedequationcanbe represented in state-spaceform.A connection between multiple elements is establishedbymatching the characteristic acousticwaves at the nodes, seealso section 3.07. For single or multiple connected network elements in the state-space framework, a transfer function G(s)between selected in- and outputs canbe computed via G(s)= ̂y(s) ̂u(s) = C(Es −A)−1 B +D. (28) Bywayofexample,letusconsidertheconnectionofaducttoapartiallyreﬂectingterminationatthedownstreamendofacom- bustion chamber. For this model, the characteristic wave entering and exiting the duct at the upstream end are the respective in- and outputs for the state-space model. The transfer function of this connected model represents a complex impedance that M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 1154318 is also valid for signals with non-zero growth rate,sr ≠ 0. This fact plays an important role in thermoacoustic stabilityanalysis, becausethe growth rateof the eigenmodes is the desired result. 3.05. Discretization of single time lags and complex impedances Time lags, e.g. between an acoustic disturbance and the ﬂuctuating heat release of the heat source, can be represented in pseudo-space using an advectionequation, 𝜕𝛽 𝜕t + 𝜕𝛽 𝜕𝜉 = 0. (29) Here, 𝛽 is the quantity transported along𝜉 with speed 1.000. Assuming a domain [0,𝜏]a l o n gt h e𝜉 direction, a signal entering the domainat timet = 0 will arrive at the end of the domainat timet = 𝜏. Discretizing Eq.(29) in𝜉 direction, again utilizing a ﬁnite difference upwinding scheme, a linear, time-invariant system of equations is obtained that can be represented in the state-spaceframework.Note that the discretized system of equations does not depend explicitly on the time lag𝜏.A sa consequence, when represented in the Laplace domain, the state-space system, Eq.(19), remains linear in the Laplace variable s. On the contrary, if the time delay is not discretized, a non-linear terme−s𝜏 emerges that leads to a NLEVP, which can be solved e.g. by ﬁxed-point iteration ins: a(t −𝜏) → ̂a(s)este−s𝜏. (30) A validation for an FTF with a single time delay within the state-space framework, i.e. the so-calledn-𝜏 model, was conducted in Ref. and showed reasonableagreement with resultsproduced withthe FVM Helmholtzsolver AVSP,which relies on ﬁxed-point iterationfor solution ofthe non-linear eigenvalue problem. The discretization of the time lag however adds additional degrees of freedom, equal to the number of discretization points chosen. In order to adequately represent the time delay in a given frequency band, bestpractice rules suggestat least 20 points per wavelength for the highest frequency of interest. When lesspoints are used, errors due to aliasing can be expected. As an example, a time delay of𝜏 = 1 ms should be discretized with at least 40 points to be accurately represented in the frequency band of up to 2000 Hz. The increased number ofdegrees of freedom for thermoacoustic modelsdue to time lagdiscretizationis usuallysmall comparedto those emerging from FEMmodels.Therefore, the savings in computationalcost byavoidingmultiple factorizations of the full systemmatrix by faroutweig ht h ec o s t sd u et ot h ei n c r e a s e ds i z eo ft h es y s t e m. 3.06. Representation of an FTF with distributed time lags The interaction between the heat release of a ﬂame and acoustic waves is a key element in thermoacoustic systems. This mechanism is the main driver of instabilities and thus, care has to be taken to accurately include the dynamics in the thermoa- coustic model. The most accurate description can be retrieved by locally accounting for the inﬂuence of acoustic perturbations on the combustion mechanism. This is very expensive as it adds linearized transport equations for the chemical species to the LNSE and requires a highly reﬁned numerical mesh in the ﬂamearea to correctly model the unsteady heat release via a lin- earized combustion mechanism. The typical low-order modelsused to represent the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction are so called ﬂame transfer functions (FTF). These models often link the overall unsteady heat releasėQ′ to the ﬂuctuation of the axial velocityu′ ref at a reference position, which is the main cause for unsteady combustion of premixed ﬂames. The FTF model in the Laplace domainreads ̂̇Q ̇Q = ̂u 1,ref u 1,ref FTF(s). (31) In the LNSE model,̂̇Q is represented by the integral of the spatially distributed source term,∫Ω̂̇q V (xi)dΩ,w h i l ei nt h en e t w o r k model, the spatialextent of acousticallycompact ﬂames is neglected and̂̇Q is a globalquantity. Subramanian et al showed that distributed time-lag response functions (DTL) can capture the ﬂame dynamics very well in the context of linear stability assessment. Typically, the frequency response function of a ﬂame can be deduced either experimentally or numerically. A DTL can be derived from this data by ﬁtting a rational polynomial to the frequency response function and applying the inverse Fourier transformation to obtain the impulse response as a sum of exponential functions in the time domain. The convolution of this impulse response function with the time-lagged velocity ﬂuctuationsu′ ref then produces a representation in state-space form. For details on this procedure, the reader is referred to Ref. As already discussedinsection 3.02,state-spacemodelsarelinearinthe Laplacevariabl eaftertransformationandtherefore DTLFTF models retain the linearity ofthe eigenvalue problem. 3.07. Interconnection of state-space models The connection of two FEM models for acoustic governing equations via a transfer matrix, relating the plane acoustic waves between both model interfaces, was originally proposed, implemented and validated by Camporeale and co-workers. A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 9 M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 115431 Fig. 1.Schematic representing the connection of the FTF to the DG-FEM state-space model with scalarin- and outputs. The transfer matrix is usuallyused for elements of a (thermo-) acousticsystemwhere the acoustic governing equations can not represent the complex ﬂow or are too expensive to solve for. In a follow-up study, Campa et al used a transfer matrix to connect an annular plenum to a combustion chamber and incorporate the effects of acoustic time-delays, a variation in cross- sectionanddamping.Similarly,Schulzeand Sattelmayer[ 22]coupled FEMmodelsofthedomeandthenozzleofarocketengine viathescatteringmatrixofaperforatedpla te,whichrelatesthecharacteristicwaves f andg attwointerfaces,inordertoreduce thedegreesoffreedomandcorrectlyaccountfordamping.Nietal.[ 23]coupledtransfermatricesforadiaphragmandaswirler, respectively, to a Helmholtz solver. In the present study, a state-space model of the FTF is connected to the DG-FEM model to account for the ﬂow-ﬂame inter- action.Furthermore, partsofthe geometryin which one-dimensional acousticwaves withnegligible meanﬂow interactioncan beassumed,arerepresented bycompleximped ancesderivedfrom the network modelingtoolta X insteadofthree-dimensional DG-FEM. The respective sub-models are then connected to the DG-FEM modelin the sameway as the FTF state-spacemodel in order to reduce the degrees of freedomof the whole thermoacoustic model. The preceding sections have shown that models for the acoustic governing equations as well as the ﬂame response can be represented in state-spaceform. The interfaces ofthese modelsare the in- and outputs.Some ofthe inputs of one modelmatch the output of another, compare e.g. the outpuṫQ′ of the FTF, Eq.(31), which is the input to the acoustic LNSE model (̇q′ V,w h i c h is the spatiallyresolved global ﬂuctuating heat release ratėQ′,s o u r c et e r mi n E q.(5)).Vice versa, the velocity ﬂuctuationat the reference position,u′ ref, is anoutput of the LNSE and an input of the FTF, see Fig. 1. In order to form a monolithic state-space model, these internal input-output relations need to be interconnected. To this end, the individual matrices Ai to Ei ofthe modelsareappended inblock-diagonalmatrices ̃A tõE, following Emmertet al. In addition to the ﬁve matrices emerging from this procedure, a feedback equation is established for matching internal in- and output relations: ̃u = F̃y +u. (32) The vector of inputs̃u of the connected system consists of internal outputs̃y, which are fed back into the system via a binary feedback matrix F, and the true external inputsu. Examples for the latter could, e.g. be external acoustic forcing at a boundary. By applying the output Eq.(20) tõy, the feedback loop can be resolved and a monolithic state-space system is retrieved in the standard form, Eqs.(19) and (20). Details on this procedure are presented in Ref. This unifying state-space interconnect framework allows for eﬃcient and robust algorithms to perform time and frequency domaincomputations as well as assessing the systemstabilityby eigenvalues. 4. Validation case: duct with temperature discontinuity A ﬁrst validation of the DG-LNSE method is carried out against semi-analytical solutions presented by Dowling in Ref. for a duct of length L with a discontinuity in the mean ﬁelds 𝚽(x) at the locationx = b. The discontinuity is caused by an inﬁnitely thin heat source and is characterized by the ratio of mean stagnationtemperatures T 0,d∕ T 0,u, where the indicesu and d refer to the upstream and downstream part of the duct, respectively. This validation case might appear simplistic, but indeed is challenging for FEM-basedthermoacoustic solvers and has been exploited in previous studies. The materialproperties of the gasare assumedconstant throughout the domain.The inlet Mach number Mu isvaried from 0 to 0.02.The full set ofparameters is shownin Table 1.Two different casesregarding the unsteadyheat release are considered for validationin this paper: Case I:No unsteady heat release of the ﬂame,̇q′ V = 0. Case II: No unsteady heat input per unit mass. This yieldṡq′ V = cp( T 0,d − T 0,u)( 𝜌uu′ u + uu𝜌′ u)∕𝛿Q, where𝛿Q is the ﬁnite length of the heat release area for the numerical simulations. Note that this is required because of the volumetric source-term ̇q′ V. The ﬂuctuating values ofu′ u and 𝜌′ u for the numerical approach are evaluated at the reference positionxref upstream of the discontinuity. M.

Two ﬂow-acoustic interaction mechanisms are present in this case. The ﬁrst is the generation of entropy waves when an acoustic wave crosses the temperature discontinuity. In this process, disturbance energy is transferred from the acoustic wave to an entropy ﬂuctuation that is then convected out of the domain. The second phenomenon contributing to the attenuation is the convection of acoustic energy across the outlet (x = L). Due to the fact that both mechanisms scale with the mean ﬂow velocity, an increased net loss of perturbation energy, resulting in an increased damping rate, is expected for higher inlet Mach numbers. Viscous effects have been neglected for the numerical studies in order to achieve comparable results to the non- viscous semi-analytical model. An important difference between the cases considered is that, while the analytical method employs jump conditions derived from ﬁrst principles at the discontinuity, a continuous domainis considered in the numerical approach. Due to the very thin heat release area in case II, high spatial resolution of the FEM model with up to 1.00·10+6 cells, corresponding to 9.00·10+6 degrees of freedom with quadratic basisfunctions, is required. The boundary conditions are an isentropic inlet with constant massﬂow, s′ = 0 a n d ̇m′ = 𝜌′ u +u′ 𝜌 = 0, (33) as well as an acousticallyopen end atthe outlet, p′ = 0. (34) The source-term for the unsteady heat release in case II is only present in the ﬁrst cell of widthh downstream of the discon- tinuity. The reference positionxref ofu′ u and𝜌′ u hasbeen chosento be 1 × 10−3 m upstreamofthetemperaturediscontinuity to avoid direct feedback ofthe heat release. Fig. 2 shows the computed eigenvalues of the semi-analytical and the DG-LNSE approach. The latter employed a cell width h = 1 × 10−4 m( c a s e I )a n dh = 1 × 10−6 m (case II) in conjunction with quadratic basis functions. Due to the high degrees of freedom emerging for discretizations withlow cell widths, the shift-inverted eigenvalue problem is solved. The eigenvalues predicted by the semi-analytical model are used as shifts for the DG-LNSE model. All modes were computed using the direct solver MUMPS andthe iterative Arnoldi algorithm witharelative tolerance of 1.00·10−7. Modeshapes similartoaquarter wave resonator can be observed for the acoustic quantitiesu′ and p′ (not shown). In ascending oscillation frequency, these are the 1∕4, 3∕4 a n d 5∕4 modes. As expected, the growth ratesr as well as the oscillation frequencysim of the eigenmodes decrease with an increase in inlet Mach number. Note that all of these modes are stable (sr < 0) except for Mu = 0, where neutral stability (sr = 0) occurs. The small deviation in case II can be attributed to the required distance between the measurement pointxref fortheheatreleasecouplingaswellastheﬁnitethickness 𝛿Q oftheheatrelease,while thesemi-analyticalmodeluses the reference values directly at the upstream side of the discontinuity with jump conditions to model the impact of the heat release. Fig. 3 shows the relative error𝜖 of the eigenfrequencies for increasing mesh reﬁnement. For this convergence study, linear and quadratic,nodaldiscontinuousbasisfunctions havebeenemployed. 𝜖is the relative error of the eigenfrequencies averaged over all three modes (Ns = 3) and all Mach numbers (NM = 11) deﬁned in Table 1, 𝜖 = 1 NMNs NM∑ i=1 Ns∑ j=1 ‖‖‖si,j,DG −si,j,analytical ‖‖‖2 ‖‖‖si,j,analytical ‖‖‖2. (35) For case I, convergence within the iterative Arnoldi toleranceis achieved both for linear and quadratic basis functions. The distance between the reference position as well as the ﬁnite thickness of the heat release zone limit the convergence for case II, a mesh reﬁnement beyondh = 1 × 10−5 m does not increase the accuracy of the results. Slower convergence compared to case I canbe observed due to the decreasingsize of the heat release zone (one cell). Thisvalidationcaseshowsthatthe DG-LNSEmethodcanverya ccuratelyrepresent interactionsbetweenacousticsandmean ﬂow as well as ﬂuctuating heat release occurring in thermoacoustic systems. A similar study that employed the LNSE imple- mented with the GLS stabilizationmethod showed noticeabledeviations from the analyticalresults. A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 11 M.

Overall ss DG model setup Regions of the conﬁguration where 3 D effects, signiﬁcant acoustic-ﬂow interactions and ﬂuctuating heat release are impor- tant are modeled using the DG-LNSE approach, with mean ﬁeldsprovided by time averaged large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent, reacting ﬂow (see section 5.02). In the present case of a premixed swirl combustor, the DG-LNSE domain comprises the annularductincludingthe swirlerandtheupstreampartofthe combustionchamber,where theﬂameislocated(see Fig.4). Acoustic damping effects are expected to be signiﬁcant in these regions, where acoustic waves generate vortices at the swirler and at the area expansion into the combustion chamber. Thermoacoustic driving due to unsteady heat release by the ﬂame is also located here. The ﬂame dynamics is not resolved by the DG-LNSE, but instead provided in terms of a state-space represen- tation ofthe FTF identiﬁed from LES data.This is detailed in sections 5.02 and 5.04. Regions where the meanﬁeldsare nearly homogeneous and where only plane acousticwaves are expected inthe frequency band of interest are represented by 1 D,reduced-ordernetwork modelsformulatedin state-space.Acousticimpedances derived from these models are coupled with the state-space interconnect approach to the DG-LNSE domain. In other words, the 1 D reducedordermodelsprovidecomplex-valued,frequency depen dentacousticimpedanceboundaryconditionsforthe DG-LNSE domain. Details areprovided in section 5.05. A state-space model deduced from experimental measurements is used to represent the acoustic reﬂection factor of the perforated plate at the combustion chamber outlet, see Fig. 5 b. This model was suggested by Tay-Wo-Chong et al, the experimental measurements were performed by Wanke.Forvery lowfrequencies, the model behaveslike a fully reﬂective open end. Above 50 Hz, the reﬂection amplitudedrops, which leadsto anincreased loss ofacoustic energy. A sketchof the various state-spacemodels and their interconnections is depictedin Fig. 6.

The low Mach number assumption is made, which omits the acoustic waves by use of the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. the density only depends on the temperature.

The PISOalgorithm with ﬁvecorrector steps is used and thetime stepfor the integration is adjustedto the maximum Courant number of 0.07. Temporal averaging of the ﬁltered variables over a period of 0.03 s is employed to obtain the mean ﬂow ﬁelds. The FTF is computed via a system identiﬁcation (SI) approach (for details see Ref. ) from the time series of excitation velocity at a reference position and the heat release ﬂuctuations. To retain the linearity of the ﬂame response, a maximum amplitude of 20% of the mean velocity was chosen for the broadband excitation signal.

The mean ﬁelds 𝚽(x) are time-averaged LES data from the simulation that is used to identify the FTF. A 90◦ sector with periodic boundary conditions is investigated to stayconsistent with the LESand to reduce computationalcosts. Linear, nodal-discontinuousbasisfunctions are chosen for the unstructured mesh consisting of 48,000 tetrahedralelements, cf.Fig. 7. This amounts to 932,000 degrees of freedom for the DG-LNSE model. The region including the swirler and the ﬂameis reﬁned to amaximummeshsizeof 3 mmand 5 mm,respectively,t o capturethe dampingeffects and theunsteadyheat release with increased resolution. The maximum mesh size inthe downstream part of the combustionchamberis 8 mm. At the boundaries of the combustionchamber, isothermal slip walls are employed, u′ i ni = 0 a n d T′ = 0. (36) M. Meindl et al / Journal of Sound and Vibration 481 11543114 Slip wallsarechosenbecausethe meshforthe LNSE isnotﬁne eno ughtoresolvetheunsteady Stokesboundarylayer.Theother walls (annularduct and swirler) aremodeled as adiabaticslip walls, u′ i ni = 0 a n d 𝜕T′ 𝜕xi ni = 0. (37) At the inlet (index u, upstream) and outlet (index d, downstream) of the LNSE model, boundary conditions are given for the characteristic waves entering the domain in the following manner: the acoustic plane wave propagating downstreamf 3 D,u is imposedatthe inlet, allconvective wave amplitudesthat enterthedomain(vorticityand entropy),areset tozero. No boundary condition is given for the characteristic wave exiting the domain,which is the upstream propagatingacoustic planewaveg 3 D,u. Following the same approach, only the upstream traveling plane waveg 3 D,d is imposed at the outlet, because the mean ﬂow velocities are facing out of the domain. The convective waves at the outlet, namely entropy and vorticity, are neglected after they leave the 3 D domain because they have no counterpart in the 1 D network model. This implies the assumption that the convectivewaveswillnotinteractwiththeacousticcharacteristicsinthedownstream 1 Dpartofthemodel.Inordertogenerate the appropriateinputs for the 1 D network modelsthat represent the acousticimpedancesat the boundaryof the LNSE domain, the outgoing acoustic waves are determined as outputs. Note that the 1 D models require a single complex-valued amplitude at the interfaces, whereas the inlet and the outlet of the LNSE domainare 2 D surfaces. Therefore, the perturbed pressure and axial velocityareaveragedoverthese surfacestocompute g 3 D,u andf 3 D,d.Through thisprocess,theperturbationsinthe axialvelocity at the outlet through vortices cancel and the plane acousticwave contribution is recovered. For the FTF coupling, the axial velocity ﬂuctuationu′ 1,ref, averaged over the reference plane, is provided as an output of the DG-LNSE model and the ﬂuctuating heat releasėq′ V is kept as a parametric source term (input) to the DG-LNSE element. This results in a state-spacemodelwith the following in- and outputs: u 3 D = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜⎝ f 3 D,u g 3 D,d ̇q′ V ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟⎠, y 3 D = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜⎝ g 3 D,u f 3 D,d u′ 1, ref ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟⎠. (38) 5.04. FTF coupling The FTF identiﬁed from the LES was used to couple the ﬂuctuating heat release ratėq′ V to the velocity ﬂuctuationsu′ 1, refat the reference plane at positionx 1, refupstream of the swirler. In the Laplace domain, the following relation for the heat release is established: ̂̇q V (xi,s)= ̇q V (xi)̂u 1, ref u 1, ref FTF(s). (39) Equation (39) represents the spatially resolved source term̂̇q V (xi,s). Amplitude and phase of the ﬂuctuations are governed by the FTF, whereas the spatialdistributionis proportionalto the mean heat release interpolated to the DG-LNSE grid. 5.05. Complex-valued impedances from network models The upstream and downstream boundary conditions of the DG-LNSE computational domain (see Fig. 4)a r em o d e l e da s complex impedances with reduced order models utilizing the thermoacoustic network toolta X. Therefore, constant mean ﬂow values are assumedand the convected 1 D Helmholtzequationis solved.Connecting the state-spacemodels resulting from the DG-LNSE,ta X, the perforated plate model and the FTF, a monolithic ss DG model is created for which the shift-inverted eigenvalue problem,Eq. (24),canbesolved. 5.06. Pure network model A model consisting only of network elements for the whole computational domain of the burner was set up by Emmert et al. In the presented study, this model is augmented by the perforated plate model at the combustion chamber outlet (see Fig. 5 b). The same FTF as in the ss DG approach is used. The axial swirl generator is replaced by a duct of equal length, therefore any inﬂuence on the acousticwaves, e.g.reﬂection, is neglected. No loss coeﬃcients have been introduced for the swirler or the area jumps. 5.07. Stability analysis The stability of the swirl burner is assessed by computing the eigenvalues with the highest growth rates in the frequency band up to 1200 Hz. The ss DG model is compared to the fullta X network model. The degrees of freedom as well as the points per wavelength for each sub-model are shown in Table 3. A maximum frequency of 1200 Hz is used to compute the points per A.4 PAPER-DGFEM 15 M.

The computations for the ss DG model were carried outinparallelon 8 CPUs.The iterative Arnoldialgorithm converges afterapproximately 30 minfor 10 eigenmodes around one shift, using 90 GB of RAM. It is expected that the growth rates for both models differ due to the convective and viscous effects inherent to the ss DG approach, while the oscillation frequencies should be very similar due to the longitudinal nature of the eigenmodes in the investigated frequency band. The eigenfrequencies determined with the pure network model were therefore used as shifts for the eigenvalue computationof the ss DG model. The computation of eigenvalues was found to beinsensitive toperturbationsintheinitialguessforthec omputation.Relativechangesineigenfrequency were below 1 % when the mesh ofthe DG-LNSE domainwas further reﬁned to 60,000 tetrahedral cells. Eigenvalues with bothpure network and ss DG model have beencomputed with the mean ﬂow velocities resulting from LES (M ≠ 0)aswellaszero Machnumber(M = 0).Forthess DGmodelinthelattercase,themeanvelocitiesinthe DG-LNSEaswell as the 1 D ROM domains have been set to zero. The resulting spectrum of the eigenvalue analysis is shown in Fig. 8.A l ls e t u p s predictoneunstablemode,i.e.thelow-frequencyintrinsicthermoacoustic(ITA)modearound 100 Hz,referto Emmertetal.[ 75] and Albayrak et al for a discussion on the nature of this mode. This is ingood agreement with experimental observations. This mode is based on a direct feedback mechanism between the ﬂuctuating heat release of the ﬂame and the velocity ﬂuctuations at the reference point, which does not require reﬂected acoustic waves at the system boundaries. The ﬁrst longitudinal mode (1 L) at 260 Hz exhibits strong damping due to the losses at the perforated plate. Two other longitudinal, weakly damped acoustic modes at 950 Hz and 1050 Hz exhibit high pressure amplitudes only in the swirler duct. Due to the non trivial geometry,a strict classiﬁcationofthe modesis diﬃcult.The other modesshown in Fig. 8 are higher order ITA modes which are strongly damped. Comparing the results for both mean Mach number cases of the pure network model (and ), it is evident that the fre- quency shift due to mean ﬂow velocity is negligible, as the eigenvalues almost coincide. For the ss DG approach (and ), the oscillationfrequency sim withandwithoutmean Machnumberisalsoverysimilar,thegrowthratehoweverdifferssigniﬁcantly for somemodes. Most ofthe eigenmodes are moredampedwhen convective effects arepresent in the DG-LNSE domain,which canbe attributedto the transfer of perturbationenergy between acoustic and convective characteristics. Compared to the pure network model, for which the computation takes only seconds, the computational cost of the ss DG modelmight seem high. However, the ss DG modelinherently contains the fully resolved mean ﬁeldsof ﬂow velocity andspeed of sound, accounting for ﬂow-acoustic interactions that do not strictly increase damping for all modes, but can also have the adverse effect of increasing the growth rate, see e.g. the mode around 450 Hz. Some of the modes, on the other hand, are not inﬂuenced at all by this energy transfer, e.g. the longitudinal mode at 260 Hz. Therefore this study shows that the effects of M.

The markers (and )show the phase of thevelocity ﬂuctuationŝuref at the reference position ( ). perturbationenergy transferbetweenacousticand convectivescalescannot easilybeestimatedapriori. The inherent abilityof the ss DG model to represent these mechanisms facilitates increased accuracy in the prediction of thermoacoustic eigenmodes. Including those effects in the pure network model is usually achieved by damping factors that are neither straight forward to determine, nor generally applicablefor different geometries and mean ﬂows. The mode shapes resulting inthe LNSE part ofthe ss DG domain feature not only acoustic, but also hydrodynamic phenomena and can thus give more insight into the physics of the instability. Additionally,the DG-LNSE approach can also handle non-plane acoustics,such as transversal modes. This study, however,islimitedtovalidationofthess DGapproachforlongitudinalmodesinthelow-frequencybandthatcanberepresented well with a 1 D approach. Fig. 9 shows a comparison between the shapes (left: amplitude, right: phase) of the unstable ITA mode, computed with the pure network model ( ) and the ss DG approach( )w i t h M≠ 0. Note that the amplitudeofthe eigenvectors may be scaled arbitrarily. To facilitate a comparison,the amplitudes of both modes are normalized with the absolute value of the respective pressure at the downstream end of the combustionchamber,x = 1.0038 m. The reference value of the phase is provided by the respectiveﬂuctuatingheatreleaserate.Itisapparentthattheoverallmodeshapesagreewell.Comparedtothenetwork model, a strong pressure gradient in the swirler area can be seen for the ss DG approach, which also exhibits a phase shift. This effect can be attributed to the reﬂections and the losses coming from the swirler, which are omitted in the network model. It is also worth noting that the network model converts all of the ﬂuctuating heat release to axial acoustic waves, while the volumetric expansion due to heat release in the DG-LNSE domain also excitestransversal velocity perturbations. This effect is expected to contribute to the damping, as transversal acoustic waves are mainly present in the ﬂame region, where vortices form in the shear layerand dissipationoccurs. According to Rayleigh,the perturbation energy introducedinto the acousticwaves is high when heat release andthe pressure ﬂuctuations in the ﬂame area are in phase. This phase difference is very similar for both approaches, which favors an unstablethermoacousticmode( ∠(̂̇q V, ̂pﬂame)network = 0.023𝜋,∠(̂̇q V, ̂pﬂame)ss DG = 0.020𝜋).Thephasebetweentheheatrelease andtheaxialvelocityﬂuctuationsatthereferencepositionisgovernedbythe FTF( and )andshowsonlyaminordiscrepancy that stemsfrom the slightly different oscillationfrequencies of the modes(sim, network = 98.005 Hz,sim, ss DG = 105.016 Hz). This difference in frequency can be attributed to the spatially resolved mean ﬁelds of speed of sound and convective velocities in the DG-LNSE domain, which deﬁne the propagation velocity oft h ea c o u s t i cw a v e sa sw e l la st h ei n ﬂ u e n c eo fh y d r o d y n a m i c ﬂuctuationsontheeigenmode.Althoughthe Rayleighcriterionis slightlymorecriticalinthess D Gapproach,theoverallgrowth rateissmallerduetothedampingeffectsbyacousticmeanﬂowin teractionsthatwere notincludedinthepure network model.

Summary and conclusions A state-space based framework was used to interconnect a discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the linearized, com- pressible Navier-Stokes equations with reduced-order representations of ﬂame dynamics and acoustic impedance boundary conditions.This approachisconceptuallyahybridone, nevertheless the state-spaceframework makespossiblethe formulation of a monolithic model.

The main advantages of the discontinuous Galerkin discretization are the high accuracy in the dispersion relation as well as the inherently stable discretization of the convective terms bymeans of a physically motivated upwinding parameter. These merits are accompanied by the drawback of the higher number of degrees of freedom compared to continuous ﬁnite element approaches.The presented state-spaceinterconnect framework, however, allowsto resolveparts ofthecomputationaldomain, where ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic orﬂow-acoustic interactions arenotsigniﬁcant, with 1 D reduced ordernetwork modelsto counter- balance the increased computational costs of the DG-LNSE. The discretization of time delays occurring in ﬂow-ﬂame models, as well as the representation of the reduced order network models as linear functions in the Laplace domain leads to a linear eigenvalue problem for which an eﬃcient and robust solution algorithm is employed. Not reckoning the computational effort requiredtodeterminemeanﬁeldsand FTF,theproposedstate-spa ceinterconnect/discontinuous Galerkinschemecanthusyield accuratestabilitypredictionswithin minutes forthermoacousticsystemsfeaturingnon trivialgeometries and meanﬂowﬁelds.

The LRF solver is based on linearized compressible Navier-Stokes and reacting species transport equations and thereby includes a model for the dynamic response of the flame to flow perturbations in an inherent manner. The equations are discretized using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. By way of example, thermoacoustic characteristics of attached and lifted laminar premixed flames are investigated. First, the respective flame transfer functions (FTFs) are computed in the frequency domain with the LRF solver. The results are in agreement with reference FTFs identified from CFD time-series. Secondly, the LRF solver is employed for thermoacoustic stability analysis, i.e. computation of shape, frequency, and growth rate of eigenmodes. Results are compared to established hybrid methods that couple FTFs with a low-order thermoacoustic network-model or a linearized Navier-Stokes equations solver. All solvers capture the dominant thermoacoustic mode, but only the LRF resolves local flow-flame interaction, revealing e.g. the onset of the flame movement and the propagation of distortions along the flame. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.

Introduction Modern, low-emission gas turbines are prone to thermoacoustic instabilities, which originate from a feedback between unsteady heat release and acous- tics.

Prediction of thermoacoustic instabilities by means of high-fidelity simulations of the com- pressible reacting flow requires very considerable computational resources. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of a gas turbine combustor, say, may be unaffordable for industrial purposes. To reduce the problem size, a variety of modeling assump- tions may be invoked to formulate hybrid ap- proaches, which typically couple a model for the https://doi.org/10.01016/j.proci.2018.006.0142 1540-7489 © 2018 The Combustion Institute.

Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 propagation and dissipation of acoustic waves with a flame transfer function (FTF). The FTF describes a flow-flame interaction and relates fluctuations of the global heat release rate to velocity fluctuations at a reference point upstream of the flame. Flame transfer functions can be derived analytically or ob- tained from experiments or CFD simulations, see for instance [1–3]. Thermoacoustic network-models (TNMs) repre- sent a very popular, low-order hybrid approach. A TNM represents a combustor as a conjunc- tion of elements, such as ducts and area jumps. Acoustic waves propagate through the resulting network of elements. The heat release fluctuations are modeled using an FTF and produce acoustic perturbations according to the linearized Rankine– Hugoniot jump conditions. Due to increasing computing power and im- proved numerical algorithms, it has become possi- ble to resolve the acoustic field in a combustor in two or three dimensions with the Helmholtz, the linearized Euler or the linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSE). The spatial resolution of the mean and fluctuating flow field variables allows to investigate complex geometries and can yield an accurate prediction of dissipative effects. These ap- proaches should also be categorized as hybrid mod- els, as the flow-flame interaction is represented by an FTF. Despite increased efforts to scrutinize non- linear aspects of combustion dynamics, linear analysis remains extremely useful and important for fundamental studies of flow-flame-interaction mechanisms, for sensitivity or uncertainty analy- sis, for optimization, and for industrial application. This motivates the quest for more efficient, more accurate and more widely applicable methods for linear thermoacoustic stability analysis. In this paper, we suggest an approach with an inherent description of the flame dynamics. Specif- ically, we analytically linearize the Navier-Stokes and reacting species transport equations to obtain linearized reactive flow (LRF) equations. With such a monolithic formulation, the linear flame dynam- ics is by design inherited from the governing equa- tions; an external FTF is not required. The LRF equations are discretized using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The LRF solver requires a CFD simulation to obtain mean fields, but no additional unsteady CFD simulations are needed to identify the FTF. The works by van Kampen et al on the response of a premixed flame to fluctuations of equivalence ratio and by Blanchard et al on the effects of flow disturbances on the flame (and vice versa) may be regarded as precursors of the LRF approach. Those studies employ a numerical lin- earization of the governing equations and compute the flame transfer functions by simulating the step response in the time domain. In contrast, the LRF equations are derived analytically and the solver operates in the frequency domain, which allows to compute the FTF as well as thermoacoustic eigen- modes with high accuracy and efficiency. The present paper introduces the LRF solver and verifies results by comparison with established hybrid approaches. By way of example, we study the flame dynamics and the dominant thermoa- coustic eigenmodes of attached as well as lifted, compact, laminar, premixed flames. The full poten- tial of the method - e.g. for non-compact flames - shall be exploited in further studies. The paper is structured as follows: in the next section, we introduce the LRF and the two hy- brid approaches, TNM and LNSE. Afterwards, we compare the FTFs computed by the LRF solver and deduced from CFD simulations, respectively, for two flame configurations. Then we compute and compare the dominant thermoacoustic eigen- modes. The paper closes with conclusions and an outlook for further investigations. 2. Linearized reacting flow 2.01. Nonlinear governing equations Both the Open FOAM solver, which computes the mean flow fields and the reference FTF, and the LRF solver are based on the nonlinear reactive flow equations: ∂ρ ∂t + ∂ρu j ∂x j = 0, (1) ∂ρu i ∂t + ∂ρu i u j ∂x j = − ∂p ∂x i + ∂τij ∂x j, (2) ∂ ∂t ( ρh − p ) + ∂ρu j h ∂x j = ∂ ∂x j ( α ∂h ∂x j ) + ˙ ω T, (3) ∂ρY k ∂t + ∂ρu j Y k ∂x j = ∂ ∂x j ( D ∂Y k ∂x j ) + ˙ ω i. (4) Variables ρ, u i, and Y k denote density, velocity component in the i -direction, and mass fraction of the species k. The viscous term is neglected in the conservation equation (3) for the sensible enthalpy h. The heat flux is approximated by −α ( ∂ h/∂ x j ) in- stead of Fourier’s law 1, which is commonly done when the energy equation is written in terms of the sensible enthalpy. The sensible enthalpy for the species k is calculated from JANAF polynomials with coefficients a j : h k (T ) = ∫ T T ref c p,k d ˜ T = R k 5 ∑ j=1 a j T j − T j ref j, (5) 1 In this study we follow the Open FOAM definitions of the thermal and mass diffusivities, α and D, with SI units kg/(ms). A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 5309 with the specific gas constant R k for the species k. The sensible enthalpy of the mixture is computed using the species mass fractions: h = ∑ k h k Y k. The viscous stress tensor τij reads: τij = μ ( ∂u i ∂x j + ∂u j ∂x i ) − 2 μ∂u l ∂x l δij, (6) where δij is the Kronecker delta. The pressure p, the density ρ, and the temperature T are linked by the ideal gas law: p = ρRT. The dynamic viscosity μ is given by Sutherland’s law: μ = A s T 1 / 2 / ( 1 + T S /T ) with A s = 1. 67212 · 10 −6 kg / (ms K 1 / 2 ) and T S = 170. 672 K. To deter mine ther mal diffusivity α a constant Prandtl number Pr = μ/α = 0. 71 is as- sumed. Similarly, with unity Lewis number for all species, Schmidt number Sc and mass diffusivity D 2 obey Sc = μ/D = 0. 71. We model the methane-air combustion using a one-step Westbrook and Dryer chemistry mechanism with a progress rate Q : Q = Aρa + b Y a O 2 Y b CH 4 W a O 2 W b CH 4 exp ( − E a T R univ ), (7) with A = 6. 7 × 10 12 cgs units, E a = 48. 4 kcal / mol, R univ = 1. 987 × 10 3 kcal / (mol K), a = 1. 3 and b = 0. 2. The methane consumption rate is ˙ ω CH 4 = −W CH 4 Q and the heat release rate is ˙ ω T = /Delta 1 h ◦Q, where W CH 4 is the molar mass of methane and /Delta 1 h ° is the standard enthalpy of reaction. 2.02. Linearized governing equations We split field variables into time-averaged and fluctuating parts, indicated by the overline and the prime, respectively. Linearization of equations (1) – (4) yields: ∂ρ′ ∂t + ∂ ∂x j ( ρu ′ j + ρ′ u j ) = 0, (8) ∂ ∂t ( ρu ′ i + ρ′ u i ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ρu i u ′ j + ρu ′ i u j + ρ′ u i u j ) = − ∂p ′ ∂x i + ∂τ ′ ij ∂x j, (9) ∂ ∂t ( ρh ′ +ρ′ h − p ′ ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ρu j h ′ + ρu ′ j h +ρ′ u j h ) = ∂ ∂x j ( α ∂h ′ ∂x j + α′ ∂ h ∂x j ) + ˙ ω ′ T, (10) ∂ ∂t ( ρY ′ k +ρ′ Y k ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ρu j Y ′ k + ρu ′ j Y k + ρ′ u j Y k ) = ∂ ∂x j ( D ∂Y ′ k ∂x j + D ′ ∂ Y k ∂x j ) + ˙ ω ′ k. (11) Note that the enthalpy equation cannot be reduced to the pressure equation because c p is not constant, see Eq. (5). Furthermore, τ′ ij = −2 δij ( μ∂u ′ l ∂x l + μ′ ∂ u l ∂x l ) + μ ( ∂u ′ i ∂x j + ∂u ′ j ∂x i ) + μ′ ( ∂ u i ∂x j + ∂ u j ∂x i ), μ′ = μ T + 3 T S 2( T + T S ) T ′ T, h ′ = c p T ′ + ∑ k h k Y ′ k, T ′ T = p ′ p − ρ′ ρ, ˙ ω ′ k = ˙ ω k ( ( a + b ) ρ′ ρ + T a T ′ T 2 + a Y ′ O 2 Y O 2 + b Y ′ CH 4 Y CH 4 ), D ′, α′ and ˙ ω ′ T are computed in an analogous man- ner. Fuel mass fraction Y CH 4 appears in the de- nominator of the equation for ˙ ω ′ k, which can lead to numerical problems. Its value is thus limited to Y CH 4 ≥ max ( Y CH 4 ) × 10 −4. In this study, we consider premixed flames with the global one-step reaction. Thus, it suffices to transport a single species or a single progress variable. We choose to transport Y ′ CH 4; hence the mass-fraction of oxygen required for the compu- tation of the reaction progress is given by Y ′ O 2 = (2 W O 2 /W CH 4 ) Y ′ CH 4. The remaining linearized field variables are p ′, ρ′, and u ′ i. For the sake of com- pactness, we avoid rewriting the linearized Eqs. (8) – (11) in terms of the selected linearized variables, it can be done without essential difficulty using the expressions provided above. In closing this section we point out that in or- der to make the linearized equations fully consis- tent with the original nonlinear problem, first-order fluctuations of flow variables as well as material properties are retained. Note that the latter was cru- cial to achieve quantitative agreement with estab- lished methods (see below). Somewhat surprisingly, no sophisticated treatment of the strongly nonlin- ear Arrhenius term was required. 2.03. Discretization The linearized reacting flow equations are dis- cretized using the discontinuous Galerkin finite el- ement method with a local Lax-Friedrichs flux for- mulation. This method, which has proven to be robust for convectively-dominated problems, is an established method in CFD and was adopted only recently for a hybrid thermoacoustic solver. The discretization with linear ansatz functions A.5 PAPER-LRF 5310 A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 Fig. 1. Computational domain (top), mean heat release rate of the attached flame (middle) and of the lifted flame (bottom). for all linearized variables is implemented in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. The mean fields are provided by Open FOAM simula- tions. The derivatives of the mean fields, such as ∂ u i /∂ x j, ∂ Y CH 4 /∂ x j, and ∂ h /∂x j, are computed by the LRF solver internally. In this study, the LRF solver computes the flame response in the frequency domain: ˆ ˙ Q = C ( iωE − A ) −1 B ˆ u ref, (12) where A, B, C and E are the system, input, out- put and mass matrices. Alternatively, the flame re- sponse may be deduced from a step response or broadband excitation in the time domain. We solve for eigenvalues with an implicitly restarted Arnoldi algorithm. All computations are per- formed with the direct parallel solver MUMPS. 3. Hybrid thermoacoustic models The FTFs predicted by the LRF approach shall be verified by comparison with FTFs identified from CFD time-series, see Section 4.01 and. Moreover, frequency and growth rate of the dom- inant thermoacoustic mode predicted by the LRF approach shall be compared to established hybrid approaches, which couple a model for the propa- gation and dissipation of acoustic waves with an FTF. In this section, the acoustic models are briefly described. 3.01. Thermoacoustic network-model To represent the configurations under investiga- tion (see Fig. 1 ), thermoacoustic network-models are built from simple elements such as ducts and sudden changes in cross-sectional area. The flame is assumed to be acoustically compact, so fluctua- tions of the global heat release rate ˙ Q ′ fully describe the flame dynamics and are related to the velocity fluctuations u ′ ref at a reference point upstream of the flame through an FTF: ˆ ˙ Q ˙ Q = F ( ω ) ˆ u ref u ref, (13) where the circumflex denotes the complex fluc- tuation amplitude at frequency ω. The FTF is then coupled to the TNMs via linearized Rankine– Hugoniot jump conditions. The network mod- els are set up with the open source tool ta X, which is based on a state-space formulation. The TNMs comprise no more than one thousand de- grees of freedom; hence eigenvalues are computed within seconds. In the configuration investigated, the ducts are very short, so the corresponding viscous losses are negligible. Furthermore, loss coefficients at area jumps are not applied since semi-empirical approximations for the acoustic losses involve a high degree of uncertainty. There- fore, the reader should keep in mind that growth rates computed with the TNMs represent a worst- case result. 3.02. Linearized Navier–Stokes coupled with FTF The hybrid model based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations employs the same equa- tions and discretization as the LRF, but without the transport equation for the fuel mass-fraction and the corresponding linearized reaction rate in the en- thalpy equation. Instead, the unsteady heat release is represented by an FTF. The LNSE uses the same FTF as the TNM but additionally resolves the spa- tial extent of the flame. Thus, the fluctuating heat release rate results in a spatially distributed source term ˙ ω ′ T. Following, we assume a distribution proportional to the local mean heat release rate: ˆ ˙ ω T ( ⃗ x ) = ˙ ω T ( ⃗ x ) F ( ω ) ˆ u ref u ref. (14) Using this formulation, the local fluctuations of the heat release rate are synchronized throughout the entire domain. This should be adequate for an acoustically compact flame, although it ignores any phase lag between the flame response at the root and the tip, say, and the consequential possibility of destructive interference. Both the TNM and the LNSE models employed in this study employ a state-space formulation. The FTF is also converted to the state space representa- tion and coupled with the acoustic system matrices, which yields a linear eigenvalue problem. Note that the LNSE solver requires roughly 10% to 30% less computational resources than the LRF solver on the same mesh due to the reduced number of variables. A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 5311 4. Investigation of a laminar premixed flame 4.01. Numerical setup By way of example, we investigate a generic, laminar premixed flame that is stabilized on a slit as shown in Fig. 1 (top). Exploiting the symmetry along and across the slits reduces the simulation do- main to one-half of the flame in two dimensions. If the burner plate is adiabatic, then the flame attaches to it, see Fig. 1 (middle). Setting a constant sur- face temperature T W = 375 K at the burner plate results in a lifted flame as shown in Fig. 1 (bot- tom). The remaining flow parameters are identical for both configurations: the inlet velocity is 0.03 m/s, the equivalence ratio equals 0.08, the inlet tempera- ture is 293 K, and the outlet pressure is 101325 Pa. The CFD solver employs standard boundary conditions: isothermal inlet with fixed velocity and mixture, outlet with fixed static pressure, non-slip walls at the burner plate, symmetry at the top and bottom of the computational domain. A struc- tured mesh with 53600 square cells of size of /Delta 1 x = 25 μm resolves the flame with 16 cells. The LRF and LNSE solvers use corresponding linearized boundary conditions. Two meshes are used: a fine mesh that is identical to the CFD mesh, and a coarser mesh with /Delta 1 x = 40 μm and 21100 cells (10 cells across the flame). A flame transfer function as required for hy- brid models is identified as a finite impulse response from time-series data generated by Open FOAM simulations. A broadband velocity excitation with an amplitude of 0. 05 u inlet is imposed at the inlet. To ensure a robust simulation and reduce noise, a weakly compressible version of the reactive Open- FOAM solver is employed. The CFL number is 0.01, and the simulation time is 0.015 s, which is suf- ficient for the accurate identification of the FTF in this study. The identification methodology is dis- cussed in detail by Tay-Wo-Chong et al and Po- lifke. The computation of the FTF is quite time consuming, since it requires a long time series for the identification process – typically 0.015 s to 0.03 s, which entails compute times of several days. Open FOAM simulations without excitation provide the flow parameters of the burnt and un- burnt gas for the TNM as well as the mean fields for the LNSE and LRF. In these simulations, the CFL number was decreased to 0.001 to better resolve the chemical time scale and thus obtain a better flame- front resolution. 4.02. Flame transfer function We use the inlet velocity of the computational domain as the reference velocity for the flame trans- fer functions, see Eq. (13). The FTFs of the attached (left) and lifted (right) flames were identified from the Open FOAM time- series with more than 95% accuracy, see Fig. 2. Due to a very high identification accuracy, the confi- dence intervals are negligibly small and therefore omitted. Both flames show a low-pass behavior. The lifted flame exhibits an excess gain at around 65 Hz, followed by a very rapid decline, such that its response is close to zero for frequencies above 200 Hz. Figure 2 also shows the flame frequency re- sponses computed by the LRF solver with two dif- ferent meshes. For both the attached and lifted flames, the LRF solver yields similar results for mesh sizes /Delta 1 x = 40 μm and 25 μm, indicating dis- cretization independence. Further reduction of the mesh size preserving the FTF quality is possible by coarsening the regions further away from the flame and the corners of the burner plate. In the follow- ing, we focus on results obtained on the fine mesh ( /Delta 1 x = 25 μm ), which corresponds to the CFD mesh. The LRF solver predicts the phase of the fre- quency response well. The gain of the frequency re- sponse is perfectly predicted for the attached flame and overestimated by up to 10% for the lifted flame. These results are achieved at significantly lower computational cost than running a transient CFD simulation for the FTF identification: 6 CPUh and 22 GB RAM for the computation of 16 frequency responses vs. 300 CPUh and 2 Gb RAM for the CFD simulation on the same mesh. To reduce the RAM requirements, an iterative solver may be used –typically atthecost of longer computationaltime. 4.03. Thermoacoustic eigenmodes In this section, we investigate the thermoacous- tic eigenmodes and eigenvalues – i.e. frequencies and growth rates –of the two flame configurations. The simulation domain is very small (14 mm), such that acoustic cavity-modes can be found only at very high frequencies in the k Hz range. Thus, we set the inlet and outlet boundaries to be nonreflecting and concentrate on intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) eigenmodes, which may be unstable for nonreflect- ing boundaries provided that the flame response is sufficiently strong. Alternatively, impedance boundary conditions formulated as state space sys- tems could be used, as suggested by Jaensch et al. The frequencies of ITA modes in an anechoic environment can be approximately determined by the “π criterion” : ITA modes may occur when- ever the phase of the FTF is close to an odd multiple of π. Inspecting Fig. 2, we see that ITA frequencies should be around 170 Hz for the attached flame and 100 Hz for the lifted flame. Now, we compare predictions of the LRF solver with the two hybrid approaches described in Section 3. The TNM ( ◦) and LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ) share the same FTF identified from CFD time-series as de- scribed in the previous subsection. All models pre- dict the unstable thermoacoustic modes and yield A.5 PAPER-LRF 5312 A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 Fig. 2.

Dominant thermoacoustic eigenvalues of the at- tached flame ( ≈ 170 Hz) and the lifted flame ( ≈ 100 Hz) predicted with LRF ( + ), LNSE with FTF LRF ( △ ), LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ) and TNM ( ◦) with FTF identified from CFD time- series. eigenfrequencies similar to the ones suggested by the π criterion. The LRF solver requires most computa- tional resources for the eigenvalue computation (0.04 CPUh and 22 GB RAM). The LNSE solver requires slightly less computational resources (0.04 CPUh and 18 GB RAM). The TNM solver computes eigenvalues within seconds due to the small number of degrees of freedom. Keep in mind, however, that even though the hybrid solvers are less costly than the LRF solver, they require to determine or measure an external FTF with considerable effort. The LNSE as well as the LRF account for mean flow effects and allow for a linear energy trans- fer between acoustics, vorticity, and entropy waves. Fig. 4. Unstable eigenmode of the attached flame at 170 Hz: positive real part of the fluctuating heat release rate in black and negative in white at the top, its stream- wise distribution at the bottom. That results in a more accurate prediction of acous- tic dissipation than using TNM and, typically, in smaller growth rates. The TNM ( ◦) provides higher growth rates than the LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ), since the TNM neglects acoustic losses other than those associated with the nonreflecting in- and outlets. The growth rates computed by the LRF ( + ) differ from those computed by the LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ). We offer two reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, LRF slightly over-predicts the FTF gain of the lifted flame at its eigenfrequency, which should translate into an increase in growth rate. Secondly, there are important differences in the modeling of flow-flame interactions by the LRF and LNSE. The LRF locally resolves the flow-flame interaction. This is demonstrated, for A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 5313 Fig. 5.

Black lines indicate the mean flame position. instance, for the attached flame 2 in Fig. 4. The fig- ure shows the unstable mode at 170 Hz in terms of the real part of the fluctuating heat release rate. Only the flame tip yields a significant contribution to the global fluctuation of the heat release rate, since the local fluctuations upstream of the flame tip cancel out. The local fluctuations in heat release rate change from negative (white color) to posi- tive (black) across the flame indicating the onset of the flame movement towards the burnt mixture (or vice versa). Furthermore, the LRF captures a dis- tortion, initiated at the flame root and propagated downstream along the flame, changing the direc- tion of the flame movement 3 In contrast, the LNSE does not explicitly resolve the spatio-temporal evolution of flame movement and distortion along the length of the flame. In- stead, the heat release rate fluctuation is synchro- nized along the length of the flame and is propor- tional to the mean heat release rate. Consequently, the fluctuating velocity fields that result from un- steady heat release differ for the LRF and LNSE formulations (see Fig. 5 ), which should contribute to the differences in predicted growth rates. To facilitate further analysis, we introduce one additional model. We couple the LNSE with the flame transfer function that is computed using the linearized reactive flow solver 4 This new model is abbreviated as LNSE LRF. The LRF and LNSE LRF share the same FTF, so these two models cannot show any discrepancies in their growth-rate predic- tions related to the gain of the FTF, but only related to the differences in the flow-flame modeling. For the lifted flame, the growth rates provided by the LRF ( + ) and LNSE LRF ( △ ) are in a much bet- ter agreement than those provided by the LRF ( + ) and LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ). Hence, the discrepancy between the LRF and LNSE originates mostly from the gain 2 The detached flame shows a similar onset of move- ment. 3 An animation of the propagating flame distortion is provided in supplementary materials. 4 The FTF LRF is fitted as a rational polynomial to a sampled frequency response and is valid over the entire frequency range. of the FTF at the eigenfrequency, which was over- predicted by the LRF. For the attached flame, the gain of the FTF is perfectly captured by the LRF. Hence, the differ- ence between the growth rates computed by the LRF ( + ) and LNSE ( /bigtriangledown ) is attributed solely to the differences in the flow-flame modeling. 5. Conclusion and outlook This paper introduces a linearized reactive flow solver to analyze the flame dynamics of attached and lifted laminar premixed flames as well as their thermoacoustic stability. The LRF captures the dy- namics of both flames quite well: the phase of the flame frequency response is accurately predicted, while its gain is very well predicted for the at- tached flame and only slightly overestimated for the lifted flame. The LRF solver also correctly pre- dicts the dominant thermoacoustic modes and re- solves the spatio-temporal evolution of the mode shapes, making explicit the local fluctuations of heat release, the onset of the flame movement, and the convective propagation of flame distor- tion. For the simplistic test cases considered here with compact, velocity-sensitive, premixed flames, established thermoacoustic models such as TNM and LNSE also capture the eigenmodes in terms of frequency and growth rate quite well, but they do not resolve local flow-flame interaction due to their coupling with a global FTF. The LRF is a very promising approach be- cause of its monolithic formulation with an inher- ent flow-flame-acoustic interaction. Admittedly, it is computationally more expensive than the LNSE approach due to one additional variable and pos- sibly higher resolution in the flame region. On the other hand, the LRF approach does not require an external FTF, so an unsteady CFD simula- tion for the identification of the FTF is not re- quired. The local flow-flame interaction resolved by the LRF is particularly important for the inves- tigation of non-compact flames and/or non-plane acoustics, i.e. at higher frequencies, where a stan- dard FTF that relates upstream velocity to over- all heat release is inadequate [24–26]. Moreover, A.5 PAPER-LRF 5314 A. Avdonin, M. Meindl and W. Polifke / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 37 5307–5314 configurations where fluctuations in equivalence ratio, pressure or temperature perturb the heat release require corresponding MISO or MIMO (multiple-input, single/multiple-output) formula- tions of hybrid models. In such cases, it is strictly speaking necessary to identify several flame trans- fer functions and couple them to an acoustic model, which can quickly become expensive and cumber- some. Conversely, LRF makes possible increased flexibility in the analysis of such systems: any combination of fluctuating variables may be cho- sen as “input” or “output”, the respective trans- fer behavior or sensitivities may be studied in a MIMO framework with very favorable computa- tional costs. Future studies should extend the approach to turbulent, technically premixed flames at high fre- quencies and exploit advantages or identify limita- tions of the method.

The inability of the global FTF to account for the effects of ﬂame movement is identiﬁed as the root cause of this unphysi- cal behavior. Utilization of a local FTF, which resolves unsteady heat release on scales comparable to the reaction zone of the ﬂame, suppresses the spurious entropy perturbations. This aﬃrms that ﬁne-grained resolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of heat release rate ﬂuctuations in the combustion zone is required to model the movement of the ﬂame front, even for acoustically and convectively compact ﬂames. As an alternative to hybrid models, a Linearized Reactive Flow (LRF) approach is employed, which extends the LNSE by the linearized species transport equations as well as the reaction mechanism. Such a monolithic approach inherently accounts for the locally resolved ﬂame dynamics, including the move- ment of the ﬂame front, and does not require an external model for the ﬂame-ﬂow interaction. Thus the LRF eliminates the need for the cumbersome identiﬁcation of a local FTF. Two conﬁgurations of lean premixed methane-air ﬂames, i.e. a freely propagating 1 D ﬂame and a 2 D ﬂame anchored in a duct, are considered for validation. All results obtained with linearized modeling approaches and conclusions de- duced thereof are validated against high resolution CFD results with excellent quantitative accuracy. ©2 0 2 0 The Combustion Institute.

Introduction Gas turbines play an important role not only for propulsion in aero-engines, but also in the energy sector, where they provide ﬂexible generation of electricity to complement highly ﬂuctuating renewable sources of energy. During the past decades, increasing restrictions on pollutant emissions have been enforced, which have promoted the development of lean premixed combustion technol- ogy, featuring aerodynamically stabilized, velocity sensitive ﬂames. The downside of this technology is its susceptibility to thermoa- coustic instabilities, a phenomenon that results from feedback in- teractions between unsteady combustion and acoustic velocity per- turbations impinging on the ﬂame. The consequences of such instabilities range from increased emissions up to the deteriora- tion and eventual destruction of the engine. Studying the physics, identifying the most inﬂuential parameters and predicting the res- onant frequencies, stability limits and margins, is thus vital for the design of reliable, ﬂexible and eﬃcient modern gas turbines. ∗ Corresponding author.

Due to the high costs and restricted diagnostic access on experimental test rigs, numerical simulations are employed to complement or replace experiments during the design process. A plethora of model strategies is available, ranging from linear, quasi-1 D network models [2–4] to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for laminar ﬂames [5–7], or highly resolved and thus very costly Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for turbulent ﬂames [8–10]. Opposed to the monolithic approach of CFD, which naturally incor- porates the dynamics of combustion processes, one commonality of most low-order models is their hybrid nature: the acoustics and the ﬂame dynamics are described by dedicated sub-models, which are coupled to each other to construct a complete ther- moacoustic model. The propagation of acoustic waves is modeled, e.g. by quasi 1 D network models or 2 D/3 D models based on the Helmholtz Equations, Linearized Euler Equations (LEE) or more recently the Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations (LNSE) [11–18]. In the given order, the complexity and computational cost, but also the capabilities of these formulations increase. For example, LNSE can incorporate so-called convective waves, i.e. the convective transport of perturbations of fuel concentration, entropy or vor- ticity by the mean ﬂow, which may be important elements of the https://doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2020.009.0018 0010-2180/© 2020 The Combustion Institute.

Furthermore, LNSE can take into account interactions between acoustics and mean ﬂow as well as other damping mechanisms that result in loss of acoustic energy in a combustor. These capabilities account for the interest in hybrid thermoacoustic models based on the LNSE, see e.g. [15–18]. The sub-model for the ﬂow-ﬂame interaction can in general be chosen independent of the acoustic governing equations. For lin- ear stability analysis, the so-called Flame Transfer Function (FTF), stemming from measurements, numerical simulations or analytical expressions, is often employed. It relates upstream velocity pertur- bations to ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate. Recently, a Linearized Reactive Flow (LRF) model was intro- duced. The formulation is based on an analytical lineariza- tion of the governing equations, unlike the numerical linearization approach pursued in. The LRF differs from the other linear models mentioned above inasmuch as it is not hybrid 1 in nature. Instead, not only the Navier-Stokes, but also the species transport equations alongside with the reaction kinetics are linearized. This leads to an inherent incorporation of the locally resolved ﬂame dy- namics, without the need for a ﬂow-ﬂame sub-model, such as the FTF. In terms of complexity and cost, the LRF is found at the top end of the linear model spectrum. It features the most detailed description of the physics behind thermoacoustic instabilities and consequently, one may expect that it is the most accurate predic- tive tool – within the limits of a linearized analysis. Much like low- order models, the LRF ansatz can be used to carry out thermoa- coustic stability analysis by computing the frequencies and growth rates of eigenmodes. Furthermore, ﬂow-ﬂame interaction can be computed with an LRF formulation e.g. in the form of an FTF, as shown in. Quantitative differences in the predictions of thermoacoustic oscillations obtained with network, LNSE and LRF models, respec- tively, were discussed in. In these studies, direct sources of acoustic perturbations, i.e. the unsteady heat release rate by the ﬂame itself, were accounted for. The main focus of the present study lies, conversely, on the generation of entropy waves by acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame interactions, which may represent an impor- tant source of indirect sound. Indeed, it is understood that the ac- celeration of entropy perturbations at the turbine inlet, say, may generate indirect sound with signiﬁcant impact on thermoacous- tic stability and combustion noise, see e.g. [24–40]. It is therefore imperative that a comprehensive thermoacoustic model correctly represents not only the effect of the perturbed heat release rate on the acoustics, but also on the generation of entropy waves. Several studies investigated the dispersion of entropy waves while being convected towards the combustor outlet [37,38,41–43] as well as the conversion of entropy perturbations to acoustic waves due to acceleration of the ﬂow. There are also several studies concerned with the generation of entropy waves by temperature inhomogeneities in non-reacting ﬂows [46–48] or in acoustically compact reaction zones, which are treated as a dis- continuity in the acoustic model [49–52]. To date, the ability of linearized thermoacoustic models to correctly predict the genera- tion of entropy perturbations in a spatially extended combustion zone has been studied only by Steinbacher et al. The present paper demonstrates that modeling a lean premixed ﬂame by means of the LNSE combined with a global FTF, which 1 Note that the LRF, like all low-order models, requires information about the mean ﬂow in the combustor, e.g. the spatial distribution of speed of sound, tem- perature or mean ﬂow velocity, and could thus be classiﬁed as “hybrid” instead of “monolithic”. However, such classiﬁcation would not make sense in the context of the present study. Instead, throughout this paper, we will regard a model as ”hy- brid”, if it consists of dedicated sub-models for acoustics and ﬂow-ﬂame interaction, respectively, and ”monolithic” otherwise. represents the perturbed heat release rate in a lumped fashion, leads to unphysical behavior: spurious entropy waves are gener- ated when the ﬂame is forced acoustically, in violation of fun- damental conservation laws and contradicting the recent litera- ture. Given that the entropy waves encountered in this case are of unphysical nature, the indirectly generated sound in an ac- celerated ﬂow downstream would thus falsely inﬂuence the ther- moacoustic oscillations and have a detrimental effect on the cor- rectness of stability predictions. The main objective of the present study is the analysis of the spurious entropy generated by the LNSE paired with a global FTF, and the assessment of two approaches that do not generate spurious entropy, i.e. LNSE combined with a highly resolved local FTF, or LRF. We supply evidence that the global FTF, which outputs a lumped value for the global ﬂuctuation of the heat release rate, cannot properly represent the effect of ﬂame movement, which in turn leads to the spurious entropy waves. Speciﬁcally, because the local values of the ﬂuctuating heat release rate are unknown, an assumption about their spatial distribution has to be made. One possibility is to assume that the ﬂuctuations follow in shape the mean heat release rate. This assumption, although intuitive, will be shown to be inadequate when investigating the generation of en- tropy waves. Indeed, it is a crucial modeling mistake that leads to signiﬁcant errors in the prediction of entropy production and per- turbation ﬁelds in the ﬂame region and downstream of the ﬂame. The origin of these errors –a s will be shown below –i s the in- ability of the LNSE to properly account for the fact that a pre- mixed ﬂame front is not a heat source at rest, but a heat source in kinematic balance with the approach ﬂow. The use of a local FTF, which resolves unsteady heat release on length scales comparable to the reaction zone of the ﬂame, is shown to rem- edy the situation to a large extent. Likewise, the monolithic LRF does not exhibit spurious generation of entropy waves, as it inher- ently accounts for the local ﬂame dynamics. It represents thus a promising alternative to hybrid models. Note that all results ob- tained with linearized tools and conclusions deduced thereof are validated against high resolution CFD results with excellent quan- titative accuracy. The paper is structured as follows: the governing equations for CFD, LNSE and LRF are presented in Section 2. Section 3 is dedi- cated to modeling approaches for the perturbed heat release rate in hybrid models via an FTF. A 1 D freely propagating ﬂame is in- vestigated in Section 4 as a bare-bones example for the excess en- tropy perturbations stemming from the hybrid LNSE approach cou- pled to a global FTF. A locally resolved FTF is introduced in order to include the effects of ﬂame movement and thereby correctly pre- dict the ﬂow perturbations. This topic is expanded in Section 5 by the analysis of an anchored, 2 D, laminar, premixed ﬂame. The pa- per concludes with a summary and an outlook on the ramiﬁcations of the ﬁndings. A derivation of the various physical contributions to entropy perturbations by linearization of the entropy trans- port equation for a reactive ﬂow is provided as Supplementary Material. 2. Governing equations This section presents the set of governing equations for com- pressible reactive ﬂow, which represents the basis of all variants of numerical analysis of ﬂame dynamics carried out in the present study, i.e. CFD, LRF and LNSE. Linearization of the governing equa- tions yields the linearized reactive ﬂow (LRF) model. By omitting the species transport equations as well as the reaction rates from the system of equations, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) are obtained. M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W.

(4) Here, ρ is the density, p is the pressure, u i is the velocity in the Cartesian coordinate direction x i, h is the total non-chemical en- thalpy, h s is the sensible non-chemical enthalpy, τij is the viscous stress tensor, Y k is the mass fraction of species k, α and D k are the thermal and species diffusivity, respectively. ˙ /Omega 1 T is the volumetric heat release rate due to combustion and ˙ /Omega 1 k is the source of species k. The ﬂuid is assumed to behave like an ideal gas, p = ρRT. (5) Stokes’ Hypothesis τij = μ (∂u i ∂x j + ∂u j ∂x i − 2 ∂u k ∂x k δij ), (6) is combined with Sutherland’s Law μ = A S T 1 / 2 ( 1 + T S T ), (7) for the viscous stress tensor, where μ is the dynamic viscosity, δij is the Kronecker-Delta, A S = 1. 67212 · 10 −6 kg / ( ms K 1 / 2 ) and T S = 170. 672 K. The total non chemical enthalpy h = h s + u k u k (8) is deﬁned as the sum of sensible enthalpies of the species, h s = ∑ k h s,k Y k, h s,k (T ) = ∫ T T ref c p,k ( ˜ T ) d ˜ T, (9) and speciﬁc kinetic energy. The Prandtl number Pr = μ/α and Schmidt number Sc k = μ/D k for all species are ﬁxed at 0.071, which is reasonable for a methane-air mixture. Due to the low Mach number of the ﬂows under consideration in this work, viscous heating is neglected. The global two-step chemical kinetics mech- anism used in the present study to evaluate the source terms ˙ /Omega 1 T, ˙ /Omega 1 k in Eqs. (3) and (4) is described in Appendix A. The compress- ible reacting solver rho Reacting Foam from the Open FOAM tool- box, which was used to generate the CFD results presented in this study, is based on the above set of equations. 2.02. Linearized governing equations The unknown variables /Phi 1( x, t ) of the reactive ﬂow equations can be split into a steady-state mean ﬂow ¯/Phi 1(x ) and unsteady per- turbations /Phi 1′ ( x, t ) by means of a perturbation ansatz, /Phi 1(x, t) = ¯/Phi 1(x ) + /Phi 1′ (x, t). (10) Inserting this ansatz into Eqs. (1) –(4) and assuming that the per- turbations are small compared to suitable reference quantities in the mean ﬂow, higher order perturbation terms can be neglected and the linearized reactive ﬂow (LRF) equations are retrieved, ∂ρ′ ∂t + ∂ ∂x j ( ¯ρu ′ j + ρ′ ¯u j ) = 0, (11) ∂ ∂t ( ¯ρu ′ i + ρ′ ¯u i ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ¯ρ ¯u i u ′ j + ¯ρu ′ i ¯u j + ρ′ ¯u i ¯u j ) = −∂p ′ ∂x i + ∂τ ′ ij ∂x j, (12) ∂ ∂t ( ¯ρh ′ + ρ′ ¯h − p ′ ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ¯ρ ¯u j h ′ + ¯ρu ′ j ¯h + ρ′ ¯u j ¯h ) = ∂ ∂x j ( ¯α∂h ′ s ∂x j + α′ ∂ ¯h s ∂x j ) + ˙ /Omega 1′ T, (13) ∂ ∂t ( ¯ρY ′ k + ρ′ ¯Y k ) + ∂ ∂x j ( ¯ρ ¯u j Y ′ k + ¯ρu ′ j ¯Y k + ρ′ ¯u j ¯Y k ) = ∂ ∂x j ( ¯D k ∂Y ′ k ∂x j + D ′ k ∂ ¯Y k ∂x j ) + ˙ /Omega 1′ k. (14) The linearization of the chemical kinetics mechanism that is required to determine the linearized source terms ˙ /Omega 1′ T, ˙ /Omega 1′ k in Eqs. (11) –(14) is described in Appendix B. For further details, the reader is referred to the work of Avdonin et al. Full closure of this system of equations is achieved by introduc- ing appropriately linearized expressions for the ideal gas law, T ′ ¯T = p ′ ¯p − ρ′ ¯ρ, (15) the sensible enthalpy, h ′ s = ¯c p T ′ + ∑ k ¯h s,k Y ′ k, ¯c p = ∑ k ¯c p,k ¯Y k, (16) the total enthalpy, h ′ = h ′ s + ¯u k u ′ k, (17) the viscous stress tensor τ′ ij = ¯μ (∂u ′ i ∂x j + ∂u ′ j ∂x i − 2 ∂u ′ k ∂x k δij ) + μ′ (∂ ¯u i ∂x j + ∂ ¯u j ∂x i − 2 ∂ ¯u k ∂x k δij ), (18) and the Sutherland law for the temperature dependence of viscos- ity, thermal and species diffusivity, μ′ = ¯μ ¯T + 3 T S (¯T + T S )T ′ ¯T, α′ = Pr μ′, D ′ k = Sc k μ′. (19) Including perturbations of the material properties is essential to achieve consistency between the non-linear and the linearized equations. The entropy perturbations, neglecting species mix- ing, are given by s ′ = ¯c p T ′ ¯T − R p ′ ¯p. (20) In the Supplementary Material, the full entropy perturbations for a reactive ﬂow are derived. In general, entropy perturbations due to species mixing should be accounted for, as they can as well lead to the generation of acoustic waves, see Magri et al. Although present, this effect is expected to be negligible for the perfectly premixed ﬂames without secondary air ﬂows and unity Lewis number investigated in this paper. The LNSE are obtained as a sub-set of the LRF Eqs. (11) –(14) by omitting the species transport equations, Eq. (14), and setting Y ′ k = 0 in Eq. (16). For thermo-acoustic stability analysis, the source term ˙ /Omega 1′ T in the linearized energy equation, Eq. (13), is then provided by an FTF instead of the linearized chemical kinetic mechanism. This is described in more detail in Section 3. A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 2.03. Transformation to frequency domain The governing equations of the LRF and LNSE can be trans- formed to the frequency domain by assuming purely harmonic os- cillations in all perturbed quantities, /Phi 1′ (x, t) = ˆ /Phi 1(x ) e iωt, (21) where ˆ /Phi 1 is the complex amplitude and ω the frequency of the os- cillation. Subjected to appropriate inhomogeneous boundary con- ditions, the response of a system governed by the LRF or LNSE in the frequency domain to (acoustic) forcing can thus be evaluated at discrete frequencies ω. Throughout this study, the linearized models will only be evalu- ated in the frequency domain, as this constitutes a computationally eﬃcient and accurate way to deduce the system response to har- monic forcing, or compute eigenvectors and -values. It is, however, entirely possible to run simulations also in the time-domain. 3. The ﬂame transfer function in hybrid models The prevailing approach to linear thermoacoustic stability anal- ysis is the use of hybrid models, which combine an acoustic sub- model with a reduced order model for ﬂow-ﬂame interactions. The former ranges, in order of increasing complexity and accu- racy, from 1 D network models, solvers for the 2 D/3 D Helmholtz equation to approaches employing the LEE or LNSE. Note that the combustion process is always excluded from these models, e.g. no species transport equations or reaction rates are computed. To ac- count for the main driving mechanism in thermoacoustic systems, i.e. unsteady heat release, a reduced order model for ﬂow-ﬂame interactions is deduced from experiments, CFD or ﬁrst principles, and combined with the acoustic sub-model. For velocity sensitive ﬂames, such a reduced order model is usually formulated in terms of a complex-valued Flame Transfer Function (FTF), which relates perturbations in heat release rate to velocity ﬂuctuations upstream of the ﬂame. If the ﬂame is acoustically compact, i.e. if acoustic wavelengths at the frequencies of interest are much larger than the length of the ﬂame, it is usually argued that the exact spatial distribution of the perturbed heat release rate ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) has no signiﬁcant impact on the acoustic waves generated by the ﬂame, and thus on ther- moacoustic stability predictions. In that case a global ﬂame trans- fer function F G is considered adequate to describe the relation be- tween velocity ﬂuctuations ˆ u ref at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame and perturbations of the spatially integrated heat release rate, ∫ /Omega 1 ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) d x ∫ /Omega 1 ¯˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) d x = F G (ω) ˆ u ref ¯u ref. (22) Note that here ﬂuctuating values of heat release and velocity are normalized with corresponding mean values ∫ /Omega 1 ¯˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) d x and ¯u ref. If a ﬂame is not acoustically compact –e. g. at higher frequen- cies –i t is understood that not only the overall ﬂuctuations of heat release rate, but details of the spatial distribution ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) may inﬂu- ence thermoacoustic stability. In such cases a local ﬂame transfer function F L (x ) should be used, where gain and phase depend on position x, ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) ∫ /Omega 1 ¯˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) d x = F L (x, ω) ˆ u ref ¯u ref. (23) The local FTF F L relates the spatially resolved ﬁeld ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) to the velocity perturbations at the reference position ˆ u ref. Speaking in the context of an acoustically forced CFD simulation, a scalar trans- fer function for the perturbed heat release rate in every cell of the ﬂame area has to be identiﬁed. F L (x, ω) denotes the union of these transfer functions. Compared to F G, the amount of data that has to be stored and processed is thus orders of magnitudes larger. Due to the considerable diﬃculty and cost of determining a lo- cal FTF, studies that include a local FTF for thermoacoustic stability analysis are the exception, not the rule. Martin et al deduced a fully three-dimensional, local FTF in terms of an n − τ model with interaction index n ( x ) and time lag τ( x ) depending on posi- tion from Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Subsequent use of this lo- cal FTF in a Helmholtz solver showed good agreement of the re- sulting pressure ﬁeld and oscillation frequency with LES results. Other studies have determined quasi-1 D local FTFs from experi- ment or CFD with spatial resolution of heat release rate in the ax- ial direction x and explored the impact on thermoacoustic stability [59–67]. The data to identify F G and F L may originate from the same source, e.g. an acoustically forced CFD simulation of the ﬂame. Ef- fects of non-trivial local phenomena of acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame inter- action –s u c h as ﬂame wrinkling or the transport of convective disturbances along and through the ﬂame –o n the heat release rate are thus embodied in both variants of the FTF. Nevertheless, the different post-processing of the raw data distinguishes the two formulations in important aspects. For the global FTF F G, the per- turbed heat release rate is integrated over the whole domain, and F G (ω) is then sought as the transfer function that relates the scalar quantities ∫ /Omega 1 ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) d x and ˆ u ref. Due to the spatial integration, in- formation on the local distribution of the perturbed heat release rate is lost. It will be shown in the next sections that this informa- tion is relevant to describe important effects of ﬂame movement. For thermoacoustic network models, usually an inﬁnitely thin ”ﬂame sheet” is assumed and therefore the spatial extent of the combustion zone can be neglected altogether. Jump condi- tions derived from ﬁrst principles under various simpliﬁcations are employed to directly yield the coupling con- ditions for acoustic velocity and pressure stemming from unsteady combustion. In this kind of modeling approach, the source terms do not appear explicitly in the acoustic model. Thus, modeling the perturbed heat release rate in a lumped fashion with a global FTF is natural in network models. However, for acoustic models based on the discretization of the wave equation, LEE or LNSE on a continuous domain, the perturbed volumetric heat release rate ˙ /Omega 1′ T (x, t) appears as a source term in the governing equations (compare Eq. (13) ) and requires a spatially resolved region. In most studies the spatial distribution of the perturbed heat release rate is unknown, because it requires signiﬁcantly more computational ef- fort and data storage, or more sophisticated techniques to identify from CFD, and is diﬃcult to measure in experiment. Due to lack of this knowledge, a global FTF is often used and the perturbed heat release rate is either assumed to be homogeneous within a sim- pliﬁed combustion zone or to follow the distribution of the mean heat release rate. While the ﬁrst approach is obviously an over- simpliﬁcation, studies have also shown that the perturbed heat re- lease rate does not follow the distribution of the mean heat release rate for turbulent [58,60–64,69] and even laminar premixed ﬂames (compare also Fig. B.14 in this study). While the spatial dis- tribution of the perturbed heat release rate is often considered of minor importance for the generated acoustic waves due to acoustic compactness, the analysis of acoustically compact laminar ﬂames in Sections 4 and 5 will show that it has a major inﬂuence on the entropy balance in the combustion zone, which in turn may inﬂu- ence thermoacoustic stability through indirect sources of sound. 4. Freely propagating 1 D ﬂame The response of a freely propagating, 1 D, lean premixed, methane-air ﬂame to acoustic forcing is analyzed in this section M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 to exemplify that use of a global FTF for the spatially integrated heat release rate results in spurious generation of entropy ﬂuctua- tions. The peculiarity of this seemingly simplistic 1 D conﬁguration is that in order to avoid such inconsistencies, it is vital to account precisely for local perturbations of heat release rate in the immedi- ate vicinity of the ﬂame, even though the overall heat release rate ﬂuctuations are negligibly small. Note that this archetypal setup of a passive ﬂame (no ﬂuc- tuations of overall heat release rate) has proven most useful in the resolution of a well-known classical thermoacoustic paradox. In particular, coupling relations for acoustic quantities across a heat source at rest produced results that seemed to be at odds with fundamental conservation laws for mass and energy. Strobio-Chen et al showed that the paradox can be resolved if jump conditions across the ﬂame are employed that account for ﬂame movement. Likewise, the analysis in this chapter shows that resolution of the local unsteady heat release rate, as provided by the LRF or a local FTF, can represent the ﬂame movement for a spatially resolved combustion zone in an adequate manner and thereby avoid the unphysical behavior from which spurious en- tropy waves result. This 1 D case is well suited to elucidate the fundamental driv- ing mechanisms for spurious entropy generation, because 2 D/3 D phenomena like vortex formation and dissipation as well as heat transfer normal to the ﬂow direction (e.g. due to cooled walls) are excluded. The case is computed with CFD, LRF and LNSE, respec- tively, with both global (LNSE + F G ) as well as local (LNSE + F L ) FTFs for the hybrid LNSE model. Note that the LEE would neglect essen- tial mechanisms like heat transfer in the pre-heating zone of the ﬂame, thus the LNSE are chosen as a basis for the hybrid models. 4.01. CFD simulations The setup for the CFD consists of a 1 D computational domain /Omega 1 of length 10 mm, discretized with 10 0 0 0 uniform cells. The com- pressible reacting solver rho Reacting Foam from the Open FOAM toolbox is used. The inlet velocity is matched closely to the laminar ﬂame speed s L such that after ignition, the ﬂame stays in the same location of the computational domain with very mi- nor drift. The aforementioned 2 S-CM 2 reduced chemical reaction mechanism is used to model the combustion. Boundary conditions are presented in Table 1, the resulting steady-state ﬁelds in the combustion zone are shown in Fig. 1. Note that x = 0 corresponds to the position of maximum mean heat release rate. Once the steady-state is reached (apart from the very minor drift mentioned before), a broadband forcing of the inlet velocity with a relative amplitude of 1 % (compared to the mean ﬂow) is added. This low forcing amplitude is chosen to guarantee a linear regime of the ﬂow perturbations. The forcing signal con- tains frequencies up to 1350 Hz, the simulated time is 1 s. Dur- ing run time, the perturbations of integrated heat release rate, ∫ /Omega 1˙ /Omega 1′ T (x, t) d x, as well as the entropy ﬂuctuations s ′ outlet (t) (recon- structed from the variables that are solved for via Eq. (20) ) at the outlet are tracked. By means of system identiﬁcation (see for details), F G, Eq. (22), as well as an entropy transfer function E (ETF, Eq. (24) ) are identiﬁed. ˆ s outlet ¯c p = E(ω) ˆ u ref ¯u ref (24) Table 1 Boundary conditions of the freely propagating 1 D ﬂame.

Most important mean ﬂow ﬁelds of the 1 D ﬂame case in the combustion zone. For all transfer functions presented in this work, the inlet of the computational domain is chosen as the reference position. For E, the entropy perturbations are measured at the outlet. Note that the domain is very short, therefore the difference of measuring the entropy perturbations for the ETF at the outlet or directly down- stream of the ﬂame is negligible in the frequency band up to 500 Hz investigated in this study. Due to the uniform ﬂow down- stream, no mechanisms are present to convert these entropy per- turbations to acoustic waves. The ETF nevertheless quantiﬁes the potential to give rise to spurious indirect sources of sound and thereby distort stability predictions, if a similar ﬂame were part of a more complex setup with a choked exit. We chose to neglect en- tropy perturbations due to species mixing, see Eq. (20), to compute E, such that results from CFD, LRF and LNSE + FTF may be com- pared against each other in a straightforward manner. The expected outcome for F G is a negligible low gain. The rea- son is as follows: When forced acoustically with low frequencies, i.e. the ﬂame is compact with respect to the acoustic wavelength, the length of the ﬂame does not change. No deformation of the ﬂame occurs because at every position within the ﬂame, the ve- locity perturbations are in phase and have the same amplitude (compactness). The ﬂame moves downstream when u ′ > 0 and upstream vice versa as there is no anchoring mechanism to hold the ﬂame in place. The movement results from the kinematic im- balance between ﬂow velocity ¯u + u ′ and laminar ﬂame speed s L. Because the fuel/air ratio stays constant for both the steady and the forced simulation, s L is constant and the relative velocity be- tween ﬂame and ﬂow is ﬁxed. As the consumed mass ﬂow of fresh gases is directly proportional to s L and the integrated heat release rate, no perturbation in the overall heat release rate occurs. The ﬂame movement is a consequence of the constant laminar ﬂame speed and is thus always equal to u ′. The cases discussed in this study have low Mach numbers and are set at ambient pressure, thus pressure ﬂuctuations are expected to play a negligible role for the combustion dynamics. Additionally, p ′ ≈ 0 in the whole com- putational domain due to acoustic compactness of the investigated cases in combination with the p ′ = 0 outlet boundary condition. We can therefore observe that the location of the heat release rate changes, but the amount of spatially integrated heat release rate in the domain remains constant in time. Furthermore, a premixed laminar ﬂame subject to acoustic forc- ing does not produce signiﬁcant perturbations in downstream en- tropy at low Mach numbers, assuming negligible heat loss and A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY M.

Gain of the ETF computed from CFD (system identiﬁcation), LRF and LNSE + F G (both with discrete frequency sampling). complete combustion. Due to the constant fuel/air ra- tio, the heat released per unit mass by the ﬂame is ﬁxed. Together with the constant mass ﬂow consumption, this yields a ﬁxed ra- tio of upstream and downstream temperature. Therefore, it is also expected that E has negligible gain. Figures 2 and 3 show the gain of F G and E, respectively, com- puted with system identiﬁcation based on the broadband CFD time series. The phase is not shown as it is not meaningful for transfer functions with almost zero gain. As expected, the gain for both transfer functions stemming from CFD data is so low that the effect of heat release rate and entropy perturbations is negligible for this case. 4.02. Linearized simulations The numerical methodologies for the LRF as well as the LNSE + FTF approaches are identical, i.e. a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DG-FEM) that employs the local Lax- Friedrichs scheme for the inter-element ﬂux and fourth order basis functions is employed. This method has been validated in previous studies and demonstrated impressive agreement with analytical re- sults. Using the exact same numerical method for LRF and LNSE should eliminate any discrepancies that could possibly result from numerical inadequacies. For this 1 D ﬂame case, the domain as well as the mesh are identical for the LRF, LNSE and also the CFD cases. The boundary conditions for the LRF and LNSE simulations are given in Table 2. They are consistent with the CFD boundary conditions used for the mean ﬂow and impose an acoustic forcing at the inlet. Table 2 Boundary conditions of the 1 D ﬂame for LRF and LNSE.

In order to incorporate the effects of unsteady heat release rate, global or local FTFs deduced from the CFD time series data are connected to the LNSE model to build the hybrid LNSE + F G or LNSE + F L models, respectively. Note that for the case of a passive ﬂame investigated in this section with negligible gain of F G, the results without a ﬂame model for the LNSE + F G ap- proach would be essentially identical. Figures 2 and 3 compare the transfer functions F G and E com- puted with LRF to the CFD counterparts. Additionally, Fig. 3 shows the entropy transfer function E for the LNSE + F G model. The lin- earized computations have been conducted in the frequency do- main for frequencies from 10 Hz to 500 Hz in 10 Hz steps. Note that F G (and F L ) can be computed from the LRF, opposed to the LNSE model, for which the FTF must be provided. F G from LRF and CFD show a discrepancy in the low frequency band below 100 Hz. The overall gain however is very low ( < 0.006), such that this de- viation does not lead to a signiﬁcant difference in the ﬂow pertur- bations between both simulations (shown later in Fig. 6 ). This dis- crepancy is likely to stem from the slight unsteadiness of the mean ﬂow, which is a snapshot of the last time step of the unforced CFD simulation: On large time scales, 100 ms and more, say, a slight drift of the ﬂame in the CFD exists, caused by a mismatch between the inlet velocity and the laminar ﬂame speed. This minor un- steadiness violates the assumption of steady-state mean ﬂow im- plied in the perturbation ansatz and thus gives rise to erroneous heat release in the LRF. The effect is minor and indeed only no- ticeable in the low frequency band, which is associated with larger time scales. The gain of the entropy transfer function E for both CFD and LRF stays below 0.0001. In strong contrast, the LNSE + F G model fea- tures excessive amounts of entropy perturbations downstream of the ﬂame, with a maximum gain of almost 0.08 at low frequen- cies. This is evidence of a signiﬁcant shortcoming of F G to repli- cate the linearized combustion dynamics of this fundamental case. In the low frequency limit, the spurious entropy generation can be calculated from the jump conditions derived by Strobio-Chen et al. Simplifying Eq. (34) from, assuming perfect pre- mixing and p ′ 1 = 0 yields s ′ ¯c p, 2 = ( 1 − ¯T 1 ¯T 2 )( (F G − 1) u ′ ¯u 1 + u ′ s ¯u 1 ). (25) Here, u ′ s is the rate of displacement of the ﬂame and indices 1 and 2 denote quantities up- and downstream of the ﬂame, respectively. Inserting the temperature ratio ¯T 2 / ¯T 1 = 6. 674, F G = 0 and assum- ing no ﬂame movement by setting u ′ s = 0, we retrieve -0.085 for E in the low frequency limit, in which the jump conditions repre- sent an exact solution of the governing equations. This spurious outcome, which results from the lack of ﬂame movement, agrees reasonably well with the numerical results of the LNSE + F G model, compare Fig. 3. In order to put the impact of the spurious entropy waves into perspective, the magnitude of indirect acoustic waves, generated by the acceleration of the entropy waves in a ﬁctive nozzle down- stream of the ﬂame, is assessed. As an example, we assume a com- pact supercritical nozzle, for which the generated acoustic wave can be calculated via u ′ sec = ¯c 2 M 2 2 + ( γ2 − 1 ) M 2 s ′ ¯c p, 2, (26) as derived by Marble and Candel. Here, the index 2 again de- notes quantities downstream of the ﬂame, but upstream of the ﬁc- tive nozzle. M 2 = 0. 0019 is the Mach number of the mean ﬂow measured at the outlet of the computational CFD domain. For the 1 D case investigated here, the strength of spuriously generated M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 Table 3 Comparison of ETF gain for the various models in the 1 D ﬂame case.

The im- pact of the spurious acoustics is so dominant for this case because there are no direct acoustic waves from the ﬂame ( F G ≈ 0 ) and ef- fects like the dispersion of entropy waves or losses are not taken into account. Compared to the LNSE + F G model, the LRF features not only the correct spatial resolution of the heat release rate perturbations, but also the linearized species transport equations. Thus, the mere comparison of these two models does not proof in an unambigu- ous manner that the spurious entropy waves is this case can be at- tributed to the lack of ﬂame movement alone. However, the results of the LNSE + F L model shown later will demonstrate that the ﬁne- grained local resolution of the perturbations in heat release rate mitigate the spurious behavior for the most part, even without ac- counting for the ﬂuctuations in species transport and sources, see Table 3. 4.03. Importance of ﬂame movement In analogy to Strobio-Chen et al, we argue that the lack of ﬂame movement is the cause for the spurious entropy production by the LNSE + F G model. However, in contrast to the framework of a moving ﬂame described by jump conditions, includ- ing a ﬂame velocity is not straightforward for the LNSE. While this might be feasible for low frequencies in the 1 D case, where the equations derived from jump conditions can be applied approx- imately due to compactness, ﬁnding an analytically closed-form expression for the movement of a 2 D/3 D ﬂame over the whole frequency band represents a very signiﬁcant diﬃculty, because in this case mechanisms like diffusion and convection of entropy and species normal to the ﬂow play an essential role. Instead, we aim to resolve the paradox by accounting for the local perturbations in heat release rate by means of a local FTF F L, which can be esti- mated from CFD. Figure 4 exempliﬁes that a downstream displacement of the mean heat release by 0.02 mm, say, results in, and can thus be modeled by, local perturbations in heat release rate. These are cal- culated as the difference of displaced and mean heat release rate, ˙ /Omega 1′ T = ¯˙ /Omega 1 T, dis − ¯˙ /Omega 1 T. By construction, ∫ /Omega 1˙ /Omega 1′ T d x = 0, i.e. no global heat release rate perturbations are generated by a pure displacement of the ﬂame, F G = 0. This simple example showcases that spatially distributed heat release rate perturbations, i.e. a local FTF F L, can Fig. 4. Sketch of the ﬂame displacement.

However, because the integrated heat release rate perturbations of this movement are zero, F G cannot account for this mechanism and its consequences. Hence, the paradox of a passive ﬂame at rest arises in the LNSE + F G model, leading to unphysical ﬂow ﬁelds and an excess in entropy perturbations downstream of the ﬂame. In the CFD, the ﬂame can move and thus the paradox is resolved without entropy production. The LRF models the spatially resolved perturbed heat release rate in a similar shape to ˙ /Omega 1′ T in Fig. 4, thus also accounting for ﬂame movement. In order to substantiate the claim that the LRF does indeed cap- ture the effects of ﬂame movement, it is helpful to compare the local perturbation ﬁelds to the CFD results. We start with some preceding thoughts about the comparability: The displacement of the ﬂame in the CFD computation depends on the forcing ampli- tude and frequency, i.e. higher amplitudes induce non-linear be- havior and eventually lead to blow out or ﬂash back of the ﬂame, in particular at low frequencies, ω → 0. The perturbation ﬁelds of the LRF, however, are directly proportional to the forcing amplitude by construction (linearity). Blow out or ﬂash back can not happen, as the mean ﬁelds, which dominantly impact the linearized heat release rate perturbations, are frozen in place. Instead of a ﬁnite displacement amplitude, the LRF results rather show the tendency or onset of the ﬂame movement resulting from inﬁnitesimal forc- ing amplitude. A low forcing amplitude in the CFD computations is therefore necessary to retain the linearity and allow one-to-one comparison with the LRF. The CFD and LRF model share the same dependence of the displacement amplitude on the frequency, i.e. the lower the frequency, the larger the displacement, see Fig. 5. This is reasonable, as the displacement is the temporal integral of the velocity perturbations and at lower frequencies, the time to displace the ﬂame within one half period is greater than at higher frequencies. The data for the CFD was computed by harmonic velocity forc- ing with a relative amplitude of 1 % at the inlet boundary. 20 oscillation periods were simulated with subsequent Fourier trans- form of the last period. This guarantees a harmonically oscillating state, similar to the frequency domain simulations of the linearized models. The perturbations were retrieved by subtracting the steady state from the instantaneous ﬁelds. A comparison of the perturbation ﬁelds for heat release rate, entropy and velocity between LRF and CFD is presented in Fig. 6. The plots show snapshots for the real part of the perturbed quan- tities over the ﬁrst half of an oscillation period at ω = 100 Hz, i.e. with phase angle ϕ ranging from 0 to 7/8 π. Note that the second half of the period is equal to the ﬁrst half with opposite sign for the amplitudes and would therefore provide no additional informa- tion. Excellent agreement between LRF and CFD can be observed. The physical mechanisms for the CFD/LRF solutions are as follows: A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W.

Normalized mean heat release rate ¯˙ /Omega 1 T for reference with maximum at x = 0. Dashed lines show the corresponding quantities from harmonically forced CFD. Plots show oscillation with ω = 100 Hz at various phase angles ϕ. ϕ = 0 corresponds to purely real valued forcing velocity at the inlet. • ϕ = 0 : The forcing velocity is at its maximum, thus displace- ment is zero. Indeed, neither entropy nor heat release rate are perturbed, which conﬁrms that the ﬂame is at the steady-state position. • ϕ = 1 / 8 π. 3 / 8 π: The downstream displacement of the ﬂame begins. This is indicated by heat release rate perturbations, which are negative in the upstream and positive in the down- stream part of the combustion zone. The mean velocity in- creases across the ﬂame, thus the displacement in the down- stream direction results in negative velocity perturbations in the combustion zone. Likewise, negative entropy perturbations result from the ﬂame movement. • ϕ = 1 / 2 π: The forcing velocity is zero, the ﬂame displacement towards the downstream end is at its maximum. This is reason- able because the displacement is the temporal integral of the velocity, i.e. phase shifted by 1/2 π. • ϕ = 5 / 8 π. 7 / 8 π: The ﬂame returns back to its steady-state position. At ϕ = π, the same situation as for ϕ = 0 is observed (zero ﬂame displacement), but with negative amplitude of the forcing velocity. • ϕ = π. 2 π: In the second half of the oscillation period, the ﬂame is displaced towards the upstream end of the domain, the explanations given for the ﬁrst half of the cycle still apply, but with opposite sign. Note that during the whole oscillation period, any entropy per- turbations generated in the combustion zone are also ”consumed” by the reaction, such that no entropy waves propagate downstream of the ﬂame. This agrees well with the ﬂame physics of the pro- cess, and is represented in the very low gain of the ETF predicted by LRF and CFD. Figure 7 shows the corresponding comparison between the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds of LNSE + F G and CFD. The reader is reminded here that F G has negligible gain for this case and could thus also be omitted without noticeable impact on the results. In fact, a global FTF is an ill-conceived notion in this setting, where the ﬂame movement is the prominent mechanism and modu- lation of the overall heat release rate due to changes in the ﬂame shape, speed or structure is absent. It is apparent that the LNSE + F G solution strongly differs from CFD results. In con- trast to CFD and LRF, the entropy perturbations after the ﬂame are not zero for the LNSE + F G solution, indicating spurious en- tropy production. Quite simply, entropy perturbations s ′ down- stream of the ﬂame are negative, because in the LNSE + F G model, the rate of heat addition per unit mass decreases as the mass ﬂow rate across the ﬂame increases. Beyond this, spurious acous- tic waves are generated by the LNSE + F G model, as can be seen in the velocity perturbations downstream of the ﬂame. This ef- fect is interwoven with the spurious entropy generation and can additionally lead to incorrect prediction of thermoacoustic stability. This case of a passive ﬂame at rest represents an instance of a classical paradox of thermoacoustics, which has been discussed by Dowling et al and Bauerheim et al : when deriving jump conditions for acoustic waves propagating across a compact heat source, the paradox suggests that volume conservation must be used for perturbations at zero Mach number, while mass con- servation must be used at non-zero Mach numbers. Strobio-Chen et al have shown that the paradox is resolved when it is taken into account that a premixed ﬂame front in kinematic bal- ance with the approach ﬂow will change not only its heat release rate, but also its position in response to velocity perturbations. A subsequent study demonstrate, that spurious generation of entropy results from the neglect of ﬂame movement in the description of thermoacoustic interactions. M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 Fig. 7. Same as Fig. 6, but solid lines represent results from LNSE + F G For the LNSE + F G model, the non-zero Mach number case ap- plies, which allows for the propagation of convective waves. The ﬂame is passive, because the perturbations in integrated heat re- lease rate are essentially zero, and it represents a heat source at rest, because the LNSE + F G model with the steady state mean ﬂow excludes ﬂame movement. As shown in via jump condi- tions, in this case an increase in mass ﬂow rate across the ﬂame sheet due to acoustic forcing leads to a reduced hot gas tempera- ture, equivalent to a spurious negative entropy wave. For a ﬂame with ﬁnite thickness, as in the LNSE + F G model, jump conditions only yield exact results for the acoustic coupling and the spuriously generated entropy wave, when applied at 0 Hz. For models that do not involve convective (e.g. entropy) waves, jump conditions may be regarded as a valid approximation also for non-zero frequencies, as long as acoustic compactness is sat- isﬁed. It would be intuitive to infer that for cases where convec- tive waves are present, convective rather than acoustic compact- ness should be required to ensure validity of the jump conditions for entropy, Eq. (25). With a ﬂame thickness of L F ≈ 1 mm and a spatially averaged mean ﬂow velocity across the ﬂame of < ¯u F > ≈ 1 m / s, compare Fig. 1, we ﬁnd that at ω = 10 Hz, the ratio of convective wave- length δC = < ¯u F > /ω to ﬂame thickness, δC / L F ≈ 100, i.e. the ﬂame can be regarded convectively compact for frequencies up to 10 Hz. For frequencies up to 100 Hz, and thus δC / L F ⪅ 10, the same or- der of magnitude for the spurious entropy perturbations from the LNSE + F G model and the jump conditions is obtained. 4.04. Mechanism and low-pass characteristic of spurious generation of entropy This paragraph aims at shedding light onto the physical mech- anisms involved in the spurious generation of entropy by the LNSE + F G model. Although diffusive effects strongly impact the quantitative realization of the ETF, the qualitative low-pass nature can be suﬃciently described by only accounting for the convec- tive transport. Karimi et al and Yoon showed numeri- cally and analytically that the ETF of a ﬂow described by the Euler equations with steady input of heat from a source at rest exhibits a low-pass character. In order to explain the low-pass behavior of the ETF for the LNSE + F G model, we must account for the convec- tion of temperature perturbations through the spatially resolved combustion zone. First, we assume convective compactness, i.e. the acoustic forcing period should be much longer than the convection time through the combustion zone, to show consistency of this ex- planation with the model derived from jump conditions, Eq. (25). This means that during one convective ﬂow-through of the ﬂame, the acoustic state does not change. When the passive ﬂame at rest is forced acoustically with u ′ > 0, the ﬂow is convected through the heat release zone faster than in steady state. Thus, there is less time during which the ﬂow can be heated, resulting in reduced heat input per unit mass and consequently T ′ < 0 after the ﬂame. This leads to a phase of −π for E in the low frequency limit. When convective compactness is lost at higher frequencies, the acoustic state, and thus u ′, changes during one ﬂow-through time of the combustion zone. Recall that for the studies in this paper, the forcing is chosen to be purely real-valued and thus exhibits the maximum positive value at ϕ = 0, as represented by a cosine in time domain. A ﬂuid particle ﬁrst experiences increased convec- tive velocity, leading to T ′ < 0. During the transport through the combustion zone, u ′ becomes negative ( ϕ > 1/2 π), thus the par- ticle is slower than in steady state and is heated more strongly. The increased heating per unit mass during 1/2 π < ϕ < 3/2 π of the acoustic period cancels the reduced heat input during 3/2 π < ϕ < 1/2 π. This compensation effect, which appears only at frequencies for which the ﬂame is not convectively compact, leads to a reduced amplitude of T ′, and thus s ′, after the ﬂame. The mu- tual cancellation of entropy perturbations in the combustion zone becomes more pronounced for higher frequencies, asymptotically leading to zero gain in E. A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 The movement of the ﬂame in the CFD/LRF counteracts this spurious mechanism of entropy generation. As already explained earlier, the ﬂame in this 1 D case moves with the forcing veloc- ity u ′. Thus, the relative velocity between the convected ﬂuid and the ﬂame remains ¯u, as in the steady state. The convection time through the ﬂame zone is not altered by the acoustic forcing and consequently the amount of heat addition per unit mass to a ﬂuid particle remains constant, resulting in no temperature or entropy waves downstream of the ﬂame. 4.05. Locally resolved FTF The effect of ﬂame movement on heat addition can be taken into account in a hybrid LNSE model by the usage of a local FTF (LNSE + F L ). F L is derived from harmonically forced CFD through Fourier analysis and provides the complex spatially distributed rate of perturbed heat release, referenced to the velocity ﬂuctuations at the inlet. Due to the comparatively high computational effort of the harmonically forced CFD, only two frequencies, 50 Hz and 100 Hz, are investigated. The perturbation ﬁelds for the LNSE + F L model, Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material, are identical to the ones of CFD and LRF, which highlights that accounting for the lo- cally resolved heat release rate perturbations with F L is suﬃcient to get outstanding agreement even for local quantities. The results for the ETF in Table 3 demonstrate that the spurious generation of entropy waves in the LNSE + F G model is indeed connected to the lack of ﬂame movement, and that the use of F L together with the LNSE remedies to a large extent the generation of excess en- tropy. The remaining discrepancy between the entropy production of the LRF and the LNSE + F L model can be attributed to the lack of species transport equations in the LNSE. Although the two main contributions for entropy production stemming from the species transport equations, which are due to species diffusion and gener- ation, cancel out in big parts (see Figs. 2 and 4 of the Supplemen- tary Material), the remainder contributes to the overall balance. To conclude: the LNSE + F G model does not capture the ﬂame movement, which leads to the spurious generation of entropic and acoustic waves, possibly resulting in incorrect predictions of ther- moacoustic stability. To mitigate the spurious behavior, it is re- quired to resolve the perturbed heat release rate locally, i.e. on scales that are convectively and acoustically compact. This can be achieved by a highly resolved local FTF, which properly represents the heat release rate perturbations that result from ﬂame move- ment, or by use of the LRF, which indeed resolves the ﬂame move- ment directly. 5. 2 D anchored ﬂame Further evidence that the spurious entropy perturbations of the LNSE + F G hybrid model are connected to the lack of ﬂame move- ment is presented for the case of an anchored, 2 D laminar ﬂame, see Fig. 8. The important difference to the 1 D case is that F G has signiﬁcant gain because ﬂame shape and surface area change in response to acoustic forcing. On the other hand, there are no ﬂuc- tuations in the mixture ratio, therefore we expect negligibly small entropy waves downstream of the ﬂame. In spite of the anchoring at the base of the ﬂame, movement still plays an important role to avoid spurious entropy generation in this case. Fig. 8.

This facilitates the anchoring of the ﬂame directly downstream of this position. In contrast to the 1 D case, the 2 D ﬂame is anchored at the ﬂame base, while the tip can move freely. This kinematic imbalance leads to a change in the surface area of the ﬂame when forced acoustically. The global heat release rate changes according to the perturbations in ﬂame surface area. 5.01. CFD simulations A uniform mesh of quadratic cells with edge length 40 μm is used to discretize the computational domain, which results in a total of 250 0 0 cells. This mesh guarantees proper resolution of the combustion with around 10 cells across the ﬂame front. First, an unforced case with constant inlet velocity is computed with the boundary conditions as given in Table 4. Due to the short domain with fully reﬂective boundary con- ditions, the acoustic cavity modes of the system are at very high frequencies at which the ﬂame response is not signiﬁcant. The in- trinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes, typically found in the low fre- quency range where ﬂame dynamics is important, are suppressed by the fully reﬂective boundary conditions of the short domain. Therefore, no self excited instabilities occur. The numerical ap- proach as well as the procedure to obtaining F G, F L and E from both CFD and linearized simulations is identical to the 1 D case. 5.02. Linearized simulations The reactive ﬂow of the ﬂame is linearized around the steady state of the CFD, boundary conditions are chosen as the respective linearized expressions of the CFD with purely real valued velocity forcing at the inlet, see Table 5. The computations of the LRF and LNSE models are carried out with quadratic discontinuous basis functions on a uniformly resolved mesh consisting of 7668 tetra- hedral elements with an average cell size of 120 μm. This amounts to ≈ 350 k degrees of freedom for LNSE and ≈ 788 k for LRF. The computation of the ﬂame response at one frequency takes 75 s and 8 GB of RAM for the hybrid LNSE + FTF methods and 180 seconds and 21 GB of RAM for the LRF on a desktop computer (Intel i 7- 4790 quad core @ 3.060 GHz).

Figure 9 shows F G computed via system identiﬁcation from CFD as well as from discrete frequency sampling with LRF. Excellent agreement between both methods is observed, only minor devi- ations in magnitude and phase occur at frequencies beyond the maximum gain. Therefore, we conclude that the LRF can very well represent the combustion dynamics of the anchored ﬂame subject to acoustic forcing. A closer investigation of the frequency response ﬁelds of perturbed heat release rate and entropy for CFD and LRF at 100 Hz, Fig. 10, demonstrates good agreement not only in global, but also local quantities. In analogy to the 1 D case, and following established prac- tice, the perturbed heat release rate ˆ ˙ /Omega 1 T (x ) for the 2 D LNSE model in conjunction with F G is chosen to be directly pro- portional to the mean heat release rate ¯˙ /Omega 1 T (x ). Gain and phase of F G are known from the CFD. Subsequently, the frequency domain simulations of the LNSE + F G model are performed to obtain E. The ETFs for CFD, LRF and LNSE + F G are depicted in Figs. 11 and 12. As expected for a premixed ﬂame with constant equiv- Fig. 11. Entropy transfer function from CFD (system identiﬁcation), LRF and LNSE + F G (both discrete frequency sampling). alence ratio, the LRF and CFD show negligible entropy perturba- tions downstream of the ﬂame. Considering the different numeri- cal methods employed (Finite Volume Method with constant cell values and quadratic DG-FEM), the small deviation between LRF and CFD is reasonable and will not noticeably distort any ther- moacoustic stability analysis conducted with the LRF. In contrast to this, the LNSE + F G ETF deviates strongly from the CFD ETF, it is off by a factor of ~3 0 around 100 Hz. The major difference of these results compared to the 1 D case is that the gain in the low frequency range around 0 Hz is close to zero, i.e. the spatial in- tegral of entropy perturbations at the outlet vanishes. In the low frequency limit, the movement of the ﬂame is mainly connected to an increase in ﬂame surface area, leading to an increased heat release rate. The jump conditions, Eq. (25), suggest that with a gain of unity of F G, as present in this case at 0 Hz, no ﬂame movement ( u ′ s = 0 ) is required to mitigate spurious entropy production. At closer inspection, however, local spurious entropy generation of the LNSE + F G model in the combustion zone can be observed even in the low frequency limit, see Fig. 13. Fig. 10.

Zoomed in plot of the entropy transfer function from CFD (system identiﬁcation) and LRF (discrete frequency sampling). At phase ϕ = 0, as shown in Fig. 13, the LNSE + F G model gen- erates positive entropy perturbations over large parts of the ﬂame surface starting from the base, and negative perturbations at the tip. The ﬂame dynamics can be seen in the LRF model: the ﬂame stretches and is displaced in the downstream direction in phase along its whole length, apparent from the perturbed heat release rate. The strongest magnitude of the heat release rate perturba- tions are present at the tip. F G, in contrast, uses ¯˙ /Omega 1 T as the ref- erence, which is evenly distributed along the ﬂame. Thus, com- pared to the LRF ﬁelds, there is too much perturbed heat release rate along the sides of the ﬂame and too little at the tip in the LNSE + F G model. As a result, the entropy perturbations generated at the sides are over-compensated by the corresponding heat re- lease rate perturbations of F G, while at the tip, not enough heat release rate perturbations are present to compensate the entropy perturbations. Downstream of the ﬂame, the entropy waves can- cel partially due to diffusive effects and can ultimately not be per- ceived in E due to the integration procedure for measurement at the outlet. Even though the correct global balance leads to zero en- tropy perturbations averaged over the outlet (as seen in the jump conditions), locally the ﬂow ﬁeld is unphysical and stability predic- tions might be adversely impacted thereby. The maximum gain of the LNSE + F G ETF can be seen around 100 Hz. This behavior can again be ascribed to the lack of ﬂame movement by comparing the perturbed heat release rate at ω = 1 Hz and ω = 100 Hz, see Fig. 14. Opposed to the in-phase behav- ior of the perturbed heat release rate at 1 Hz, the ﬂame movement at 100 Hz is more convective in nature and therefore the heat re- lease rate perturbations are not in phase along the ﬂame front: the displacement propagates from the base to the tip. F G can only rep- resent a uniform in-phase displacement (or stretch) accompanied Table 6 Comparison of ETF gain for the various models in the 2 D ﬂame case.

With increasing frequency up to 100 Hz, the lack of convective propagation in the LNSE + F G model becomes more and more dominant, which shows in the excess gain of the ETF. The gain of F G for the 2 D anchored ﬂame, Fig. 9, is further proof for this phenomenon of convective ﬂame movement: the ex- cess of gain around 80 Hz results from an acoustic forcing that con- structively interferes with the convective displacement mechanism. For frequencies past 100 Hz, the perturbed heat release rate be- comes less important (gain of F G drops) and the low-pass ﬁltering quality of entropy generation [46–48] dominates the LNSE + F G ETF. The comparison of the perturbation ﬁelds of CFD and LNSE + F G at 100 Hz, Fig. 15, provides insight into the spurious entropy genera- tion similar to the 1 D ﬂame case. The dipole character of the per- turbed heat release rate, and thus the ﬂame movement, which is present in both CFD and LRF, is not represented by F G. As a re- sult, the entropy sources and sinks are not balanced and an en- tropy wave passes the ﬂame surface and is convected downstream, leading to the high spurious gain of E. Quantifying the impact of the indirect acoustic waves generated through the acceleration of the spurious entropy waves in a ﬁctive compact supercritical nozzle, Eq. (26) with M 2 = 0. 0047, yields a ratio of 45.05 % between spurious and physical acoustic velocity per- turbations downstream of the ﬂame for ω = 100 Hz. Compared to the 1 D ﬂame case, the directly generated acoustics by the 2 D ﬂame lessen the relative importance of the spurious indirect acoustics. Nevertheless, we reckon that the detrimental inﬂuence of the un- physical indirect acoustic waves would still be signiﬁcant even in the 2 D case. Opposed to the 1 D case, the velocity coupling across the 2 D an- chored ﬂame does not show signiﬁcant discrepancy between CFD and LNSE + F G (not shown). This is due to the strong inﬂuence of the heat release rate perturbations of the ﬂame, which dominantly affect the velocity. Pursuing the approach of coupling F L to the LNSE to include the ﬂame movement, as described for the 1 D ﬂame case, again remedies this situation. Figure 5 of the Supplementary Material shows that the entropy perturbations agree very well with CFD data, Table 6 conﬁrms that the spurious excess gain in E is elimi- nated by F L. However, considerable additional effort is required to compute F L, rather than F G, in order to avoid spurious entropy generation by the hybrid model. Thus, even though the time to solve for the Fig. 13.

They share the same over-saturated scale for entropy perturbations.

Conclusions and outlook The core ﬁnding of the present study is that even for acous- tically and convectively compact ﬂames, a ﬁne-grained local res- olution of the perturbed heat release rate, which accounts for the effects of ﬂame movement, is required to correctly predict the gen- eration of entropy waves by a premixed ﬂame. In particular, it is demonstrated that spurious generation of entropy waves results when the Linearized Navier-Stokes Equations (LNSE) are combined with a global Flame Transfer Function (FTF), which does not pro- vide the spatial distribution of the perturbed heat release rate. The inadequate representation of ﬂame movement that results from the scalar nature of the global FTF is identiﬁed as the root cause of this deﬁciency. The spurious entropy source term exhibits a low- pass characteristic, which is explained in terms of the perturbed convection time through the combustion zone. A ﬁne-grained representation of the ﬂame dynamics by means of a highly resolved local FTF eliminates the unphysical behavior. However, it is computationally very demanding to identify a local FTF that resolves the ﬂame dynamics on scales as small as the pre- mix ﬂame reaction zone. Thus the Linearized Reactive Flow (LRF) model is suggested as a viable alternative. Other than the hybrid LNSE + FTF approach, the LRF includes explicitly linearized species transport and combustion kinetics and thereby eliminates the need for an external model like the FTF to account for ﬂow-ﬂame in- teractions. Results conﬁrm that such a monolithic representation of linearized thermoacoustic interactions and ﬂame dynamics ac- counts for the effects of ﬂame movement and does not produce spurious entropy waves. A.6 PAPER-ENTROPY M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 Because self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities in a combus- tor are a highly complex phenomenon with a large number of inﬂuence factors, we have strived in the present paper to demon- strate the spurious entropy generation on premix ﬂame conﬁgura- tions that are as simple as possible. The two seemingly undemand- ing cases of premixed methane-air combustion investigated, i.e. a freely propagating 1 D ﬂame and a 2 D ﬂame anchored in a duct of constant cross-sectional area, make the analysis clearer and more stringent than more complex conﬁgurations would allow. Never- theless, one should expect that the range of applications of the LRF can be expanded to acoustically non-compact ﬂames, as present in thermoacoustic high-frequency instabilities. Furthermore, tech- nically premixed ﬂames subject to mixture inhomogeneities in the approach ﬂow can be studied without the need for a ﬂow-ﬂame model explicitly dedicated to the ﬂame response to the mixture perturbations. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnan- cial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂuence the work reported in this paper. Appendix A. Chemical kinetic mechanism The lean premixed combustion of methane and air is modeled by the reduced two-step chemical kinetic mechanism 2 S-CM 2 as investigated in : CH 4 a + 1. 5 O 2 b → CO + 2 H 2 O, (A.1) CO + 0. 5 O 2 c ⇋ CO 2, (A.2) with a = 0. 9, b = 1. 1 and c = 0. 5. One of the novelties of the work presented in this paper is the analytical linearization of this re- action mechanism. Opposed to the work of Avdonin et al, where an irreversible one step chemistry was used, the 2 S-CM 2 mechanism features reversible oxidation of CO. This leads to bet- ter agreement with kinetics of complex chemistry, but comes at the cost of including more species transport equations as well as a more laborious analytical linearization procedure (see Section Appendix B ). As the linearization of the kinetic mechanism is at the core of the LRF, a detailed description of the governing equations follows. The source terms for energy and species are modeled as: ˙ /Omega 1 k = 2 ∑ n =1 W k νkn Q n, (A.3) ˙ /Omega 1 T = − 2 ∑ n =1 /Delta 1 h 0 n Q n, (A.4) with νkn being the stoichiometric coeﬃcient of species k in reac- tion n and /Delta 1 h 0 n the standard enthalpy of reaction n. The progress rate for the ﬁrst, irreversible reaction is given by Q 1 = K f 1 ρ(a + b) ( Y CH 4 W CH 4 )a ( Y O 2 W O 2 )b, (A.5) while the progress rate for the second, reversible reaction results as the difference between the forward and reverse contribution, Q 2 = K f 2 ρ(1+ c) Y CO W CO ( Y O 2 W O 2 )c − K r 2 ρ Y CO 2 W CO 2. (A.6) Here, K fn and K rn are the forward and reverse rates of reaction n, respectively. The forward rates of each reaction are given by the Arrhenius law, K fn = A fn exp ( −T an T ), (A.7) with the rate constants given in Table A.7. Table A.7 Rate constants of the C 2-SM 2 mechanism. Name Value A 1 2 · 10 1 5 cgs units T a 1 17611.07 K A 2 2 · 10 9 cgs units T a 2 6038.029 K The reverse rate K r 2 of the second reaction is computed from the forward rate and an equilibrium constant K c 2 based on molar concentrations, K r 2 = K f 2 K c 2. (A.8) K c 2 is determined via equilibrium thermodynamics from the equi- librium constant K p 2 based on partial pressures: K c 2 = ( p a R univ T )∑ N k =1 νk 2 K p 2, (A.9) K p 2 = exp ( /Delta 1 G 0 R univ T ). (A.10) Here, R univ is the universal gas constant and /Delta 1 G 0 2 is the molar- based standard-state Gibbs function change for the second reac- tion, expressed via /Delta 1 G 0 2 = − N ∑ k =1 νk 2 (H k − T S k ), (A.11) with the molar-based enthalpy H k and entropy S k of species k and N ∑ k =1 νk 2 = ν′′ CO 2, 2 − ν′ CO, 2 − ν′ O 2, 2 = 0. 5. (A.12) Appendix B. Linearized chemical kinetics Section Appendix A showed that the analytical linearization of the reduced combustion mechanism results in a plethora of terms, especially because all the thermodynamic quantities that are needed to compute the equilibrium constant K c 2 depend on temperature and are thus perturbed when oscillations in temper- ature occur. We follow the systematic approach of a ﬁrst order Taylor expansion to derive the perturbed heat release rate ˙ /Omega 1′ T in Eq. (13) and the perturbed species source terms ˙ /Omega 1′ k in Eq. (14). The perturbations stem from the perturbed progress rates of the reactions, ˙ /Omega 1′ k = 2 ∑ n =1 W k νkn Q ′ n, (B.1) ˙ /Omega 1′ T = − 2 ∑ n =1 /Delta 1 h 0 n Q ′ n. (B.2) The perturbed rates of progress can be written as functions of per- turbations in temperature, density and species mass fractions: Q ′ n = ∂ ¯Q n ∂ ¯T T ′ + ∂ ¯Q n ∂ ¯ρ ρ′ + ∑ k ∂ ¯Q n ∂ ¯Y k Y ′ k. (B.3) The derivatives of the mean rates of progress with respect to mean temperature, density and species mass fractions can be seen as M. Meindl, C.F. Silva and W. Polifke Combustion and Flame 223 525–540 sensitivities of the rates of progress to changes in these quantities and are derived analytically from Eqs.

(B.10) features the term Y (a −1) CH 4, where a = 0. 9. In regions where the mean mass fraction of CH 4 is (close to) zero, i.e. down- stream of the ﬂame, this term tends to inﬁnity. In the ﬁnal for- mula for the perturbed heat release, the sensitivity ∂ ¯Q 1 ∂ ¯Y CH 4 is multi- plied by the ﬂuctuations of CH 4 mass fraction, Y ′ CH 4, which tends towards zero after the ﬂame for all solutions investigated. To avoid numerical problems that come with a multiplication of inﬁnity and zero, a threshold is introduced for division by ¯Y CH 4 which is equal to 1 · 10 −4 times the maximum value of ¯Y CH 4 in the whole ﬁeld, max (¯Y CH 4 ) = 0. 0429.

V orsitzender: Prof. Dr.-Ing. Michael Zäh Prüfer der Dissertation: Prof. Wolfgang Polifke, Ph. D. Assoc.

A comprehensive investigation of heat transfer in turbulent oscillating ﬂows is given to derive the underlying temperature distributions. In particu- lar, the work focuses on (i) analytical models to generate in-depth knowledge about the physical mechanisms involved and on (ii) high-ﬁdelity ﬂuid dynamic simulations as a numerical design tool and for the parametric quantiﬁcation of turbulent effects. Based on Rott’s thermoacoustic theory, analytical correlations for the acoustic wave propa- gation in ducts and channels with non-uniform temperature are derived. The framework con- siders viscous and thermal losses attributed to wall-interaction. At constant temperatures, the equations closely resemble the formulation as characteristic waves, extended by a loss-induced spatial decay. Linear temperature gradients are studied under the assumption of temperature- independent viscosity. The analytical correlations transfer to a simple model that predicts the acoustic impedance of a quarter-wave resonator. As a more ﬂexible tool for arbitrary tempera- ture proﬁles, the thesis proposes a numerical framework. Compressible ﬂuid dynamic simula- tions are conducted for the acoustic characterization. The numerical forcing is realized via the Navier-Stokes characteristics boundary condition. The simulations are successfully validated against semi-empirical correlations. Longitudinal heat transfer inside the resonator tube is studied via Kurzweg’s analysis of in- compressible ﬂows. An in-depth comparison to Rott’s thermoacoustic theory reveals identical results at an acoustic pressure node location. Simpliﬁed versions of the two correlations allow a comprehensive discussion on the interplay between hydrodynamic and thermal boundary lay- ers. The longitudinal thermal transport is maximum if the thermal boundary layer approximately exceeds the center of the channel. Subdivided into six characteristic regimes, the thesis derives qualitative statements for the heat transfer in each combination of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thickness. High-ﬁdelity Large Eddy Simulations are used to study the effect of turbulence on heat trans- fer in pulsating ﬂows. The study considers a fully developed turbulent incompressible ﬂow within an cyclic domain. At large pulsation amplitudes with pronounced ﬂow reversal, signif- icant wall-normal enhancement shows between a hot and cold channel wall. The numerical results conﬁrm qualitative experimental data and strengthen the signiﬁcance of enhanced heat transfer as an important aspect of a comprehensive design process of technical applications. Moreover, signiﬁcant turbulence-induced enhancement is found in the longitudinal direction. iii Abstract iv Kurzfassung Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht den Einﬂuss von lokalen Temperaturinhomogenitäten auf das Dämpfungsverhalten von akustischen λ/4-Resonatoren. Dafür wird eine umfassende Un- tersuchung des Wärmeübergangs in turbulent oszillierenden Strömungen durchgeführt, um die zugrundeliegenden Temperaturverteilungen herzuleiten. Die Schwerpunkte der Arbeit liegen auf (i) analytischen Modellen zur Gewinnung fundierte Kenntnisse der vorliegenden physika- lischen Mechanismen, sowie auf (ii) hochauﬂösenden Strömungssimulationen als numerisches Entwurfswerkzeug und zur parametrischen Quantiﬁzierung von turbulenten Effekten. Basierend auf der thermoakustischen Theorie von Rott werden analytische Korrelationen für die akustische Wellenausbreitung in Rohren und Kanälen mit konstanten und linearen Tem- peraturverteilungen abgeleitet. Die Modellierung berücksichtigt viskose und thermische Ver- luste, die auf die Wechselwirkung mit der Wand zurückzuführen sind. Bei konstanten Tem- peraturen ähneln die Gleichungen stark der Formulierung charakteristischer Wellen, erweitert um ein verlustbehaftetes, räumliches Abklingen. Lineare Temperaturgradienten werden unter der Annahme einer temperaturunabhängigen Viskosität untersucht. Die analytischen Zusam- menhänge werden an einem einfachen Modell angewandt, das die akustische Impedanz eines λ/4-Resonators vorhersagt. Als ﬂexibleres Werkzeug für beliebige Temperaturproﬁle schlägt die Arbeit eine numerische Implementierung vor. Für die akustische Charakterisierung wer- den kompressible Strömungssimulationen durchgeführt. Die numerische Anregung wird über die Navier-Stokes charakteristische Randbedingung realisiert. Die Simulationen werden erfolg- reich gegen semi-empirische Korrelationen validiert. Der longitudinale Wärmeübergang innerhalb des Resonatorrohrs wird mit Hilfe der analyti- schen Modelle von Kurzweg für inkompressible Strömungen untersucht. Ein zusätzlicher Ver- gleich mit der thermoakustischen Theorie von Rott zeigt identische Ergebnisse an einem akusti- schen Druckknotenpunkt. Vereinfachungen der beiden Korrelationen erlauben eine umfassende Diskussion des Zusammenspiels zwischen hydrodynamischen und thermischen Grenzschich- ten. Der longitudinale thermische Transport ist maximal, wenn die thermische Grenzschicht annähernd die Mitte des Kanals erreicht. Unterteilt in sechs charakteristische Regime leitet die Arbeit qualitative Aussagen für den Wärmetransport in jeder Kombination von hydrodynami- scher und thermischer Grenzschichtdicke ab. Zur Untersuchung des Einﬂusses der Turbulenz auf den Wärmeübergang in pulsierenden Strö- mungen werden hochauﬂösende Large Eddy Simulationen eingesetzt. Die Arbeit betrachtet eine vollständig entwickelte turbulente inkompressible Strömung innerhalb eines periodischen Ka- nalbereiches. Bei großen Pulsationsamplituden mit ausgeprägter Strömungsumkehr zeigt sich ein signiﬁkant erhöhter, wandnormaler Wärmetransport zwischen einer heißen und kalten Ka- v Kurzfassung nalwand. Die numerischen Ergebnisse bestätigen experimentelle Untersuchungen und verdeut- lichen die Bedeutung des erhöhten Wärmeübergangs als wichtigen Aspekt eines umfassenden Designprozesses technischer Anwendungen. Weitergehende numerische Untersuchungen zei- gen, dass ebenso der longitudinale Wärmeübergang durch Turbulenz erhöht wird. vi Vorwort Die vorliegende Arbeit entstand an der Professur für Thermoﬂuiddynamik der Technischen Universität München während meiner Tätigkeit als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter.

The ﬂuctuating heat release of the combustion causes an unsteady thermal expansion of the gaseous working ﬂuid and leads to spatial and temporal pressure and velocity variations: a state of disturbances that we – more intuitively – know as acoustic sound. The sound waves propagate inside the com- bustion chamber and are eventually reﬂected by the chamber walls or exit. When returning to the ﬂame, the reﬂected waves themselves now inﬂuence the combustion process. Thereby, the thermoacoustic feedback loop may lead to very large pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations. The resulting structural and thermal loads may exceed the safety margins and lead to the breaking or melting of liners or face plates (see Fig. 1.01). Prevention of such catastrophic failures requires a thoughtful design process of many combustion applications. One measure to ensure safe operating conditions is installing resonators to increase acoustic dissipation and suppress the thermoacoustic feedback. Figure 1.02 exemplarily shows the L-shaped quarter-wave resonator of a Vulcain 2 engine (main stage of the Ariane 5 rocket). For efﬁcient performance, the eigenfrequency of the resonator needs to be tuned to the potentially unstable modes. However, a change in temperature leads to a change in the speed of sound and thus may detune the resonator. In general, the resonator design according to the undamped system is not sufﬁcient. Instead, the coupled system of the chamber and the resonators has to be taken into account. The detuning is particularly critical because a coupled analysis of combustion chamber and resonator elements shows a high sensitivity of the global stability with regard to the damping characteristics of the resonator. This underlines the importance of precise acoustic characterization for a safe design of the engine. Numerous corresponding studies are of analytical (e.g. ), experimental (e.g. ), or numerical (e.g. ) nature. In a rocket engine combustion chamber, the resonator may not be treated as a decoupled ele- ment: On one hand, the damping performance of a quarter-wave resonator depends on the un- derlying temperature distribution of the gaseous working ﬂuid(e.g. ). On the other hand, the amplitude of the acoustic ﬂuctuations inﬂuences the local heat transfer. The heat transfer – in turn – affects the local temperature distribution and illustrates the necessity of a more sophis- ticated and coupled analysis. Therefore, the present thesis focuses on two conceptual problems: First, the thesis investigates the acoustic characterization of quarter-wave resonators via an- alytical considerations and via the development of a numerical tool. The analytical study is based on Rott’s thermoacoustic approximation, a framework that accounts for viscous and thermal dissipation in one-dimensional duct acoustics. It offers a compact expression for the acoustic reﬂection. Furthermore, it provides valuable insight into the physical interplay of the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer that drives convective heat transfer. However, Rott’s analytical framework is restricted to speciﬁc temperature proﬁles at constant viscosity. To over- Introduction Figure 1.01: Damages of a combustor face plate due to thermoacoustic instability.1 Figure 1.02: L-shaped quarter-wave resonator in a Vulcain 2 engine.2 come these limitations, the use of a numerical framework offers a more ﬂexible approach at the disadvantage of computational cost. To avoid the excessive parametric investigation of each fre- quency, the use of System Identiﬁcation (SI) techniques allows a broadband evaluation during one single simulation run. Second, the present thesis focuses on the more fundamental investigation of heat transfer in tur- bulent, pulsating ﬂows. Conditions typical for the ﬂow inside rocket engine combustion cham- bers are commonly reported to provoke signiﬁcant heat transfer enhancement (e.g. [4, 14–26]). However, the literature offers contradictory ﬁndings for the problem at hand, and high ﬁdelity numerical investigations on the topic are rare. The present thesis classiﬁes two relevant heat transfer mechanisms inside a combustion chamber: wall-normal heat transfer (e.g. between the hot combustion gas and the cooled chamber wall) and heat transfer longitudinal to the acous- tic oscillation (e.g. in axial direction of a resonator tube). For both mechanisms, high-ﬁdelity numerical studies reveal for the ﬁrst time signiﬁcant turbulence-induced enhancement of more than 100% based on Large Eddy Simulation (LES). These results are in line with previous stud- ies of thermoacoustic instabilities that may lead to the fatal thermal destruction of rocket engine combustion chambers. Parts of the results reported in this thesis have already been presented at conferences or in jour- nals, book chapters, and reports. Appendix A reproduces the major publications. The present publication-based dissertation guides through these publications by summarizing the most im- portant results, embedding them in the literature context, and – most importantly – showing the interconnections between them (see Chapter 5). Furthermore, the methodology of the thesis elucidates fundamental consideration of acoustic dissipation in duct and channels, the deriva- tion of an analytical model for a quarter-wave resonator, and more general ﬁndings regarding heat transfer in duct acoustics (see Chapter 2 - 4). The ﬁrst part of the thesis provides the methodology based on the existing literature and con- 1 Reproduced with kind permission of Dr. Tim Lieuwen 2 Reproduced with kind permission of Dr. Kilian Förner tributes the following novelties: Chapter 2 presents the theoretical background on ﬂuid me- chanics of acoustics. Based on Rott’s thermoacoustic theory, a dissipative duct acoustic formulation at constant and linear temperature proﬁles is derived and discussed. Chapter 3 uses the previous derivations to model an acoustic quarter-wave resonator analytically. Chapter 4 fo- cuses on heat transfer in laminar, oscillating channel ﬂows that mimic a quarter-wave resonator: Two analytical approaches by Rott (thermoacoustic) and Kurzweg (incompressible channel ﬂow) are compared. The second part of the thesis guides through the major publications connected to this disser- tation (Chapter 5). Thereby, the individual publications stand for themselves and can also be approached outside the framework of this dissertation. In addition, the thesis shows their in- terconnections and their relevance within the present Ph. D. project: Section 5.01 discusses a numerical investigation on the effect of temperature inhomogeneities inside a resonator tube. It follows a comprehensive interpretation of the interplay between hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers follows (Sec. 5.02). Section 5.03 focuses on the impact of turbulence on heat transfer. First, wall-normal heat transfer enhancement in a pulsating channel ﬂow is investigated via Large Eddy Simulation. In a second step, the numerical framework is adopted to study the longitudinal enhancement in an oscillating ﬂow. Chapter 6 summarizes the thesis and gives the conclusions of the investigations. Furthermore, it lists the attached papers and clearly states the authors’ contributions. Appendix A reproduces the papers. Introduction 2 Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation This chapter begins with the introduction of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The set of conservation equations that uncontroversially states the fundamentals of ﬂuid mechan- ics. Most of the subsequent work is based on these equations: In Sec. 2.01.01, the assumption of an isentropic ﬂow in a one-dimension channel or duct (e.g. a quarter-wave tube) leads to the description via two characteristic acoustic waves, known as the Riemann invariants. Likewise, all numerical simulations (e.g. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for a compressible, lam- inar ﬂow (Sec. 5.01) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for an incompressible, turbulent ﬂow (Sec. 5.03.01 and 5.03.02) are based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Existing frameworks that ac- count for dissipative viscous and thermal wall interaction are outlined in Sec. 2.01.02. In the course of this thesis, the subsequent Chapter 3 will focus in more detail on the crucial importance of boundary layers and their dissipative effects on the overall acoustic damping performance of a resonator tube. Rott’s thermoacoustic theory (Sec. 2.01.03) serves as the basis for the further analytical examinations: Section 2.02 derives a characteristic solution for spatially constant tem- peratures; Section 2.03 extends to linear temperature gradients. As an important limitation, the presented approach is only valid if the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid does not change with temperature. Both formulations – for constant and linear temperature proﬁles, respectively – are applied to a quarter-wave channel with one open and one closed end. Section 2.04 discusses the resulting eigenfrequencies as well as the pressure and velocity proﬁles inside the channel. The conclusions (Sec. 2.05) directly link to applying the presented method to the modeling ap- proach of a quarter-wave resonator in the following Chapter 3. For completeness, Secs. 2.06 and 2.07 outline a solution method for exponential temperature proﬁles and display pressure and velocity proﬁles for higher mode orders. 2.01 Revisiting the Literature 2.01.01 From the Navier-Stokes Equations to Isentropic Acoustic Charac- teristic Waves The Navier-Stokes equations present the fundamental framework of conservation equations that model the motion of viscous Newtonian ﬂuids. The general formulation considers compressible ﬂuids with no external forces and is well described in the literature (see e.g. [28–30]). The Navier-Stokes equations contain the conservation of mass and momentum via thecontinuity and the momentum equation. Formulated in the Einstein notation for the Cartesian coordinates with space directionxi, the differential equations that couple densityρ, velocityui, and pressure Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation p read: dρ dt +ρ∂ui ∂xi = 0 (2.01) and ρdui dt = −∂p ∂xi + ∂p ∂xj ( 2µSi j− 2 3µ∂uk ∂xk δi j ), (2.02) where t is the time and µ is the (dynamic) viscosity of the ﬂuid. The material derivative d · /dt is deﬁned as d · /dt = ∂ · /∂t + ui ∂ · /∂xi, and the strain rate tensor Si j reads Si j = 1/2 ( ∂ui /∂xj +∂uj /∂xi ). The energy equation completes the above set of differential equations (Eqs. (2.01) and (2.02)): ρde dt = −p ∂ui ∂xi +2µSi j Si j− 2 3µSkk Sii + ∂ ∂xi ( k ∂T ∂xi ), (2.03) where e denotes the internal energy, T the temperature, and k the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid. This additional equation is typically required to incorporate compressibility and heat transfer, two key effects of the present study. The closure of the Navier-Stokes equations requires two additional equations of state: The ideal gas relation yields: p = ρRT, (2.04) where R denotes the speciﬁc gas constant. The relation between the internal energy e and the temperature reads: e = ∫ cv d T = ∫ cpd T − p ρ, (2.05) where cv and cp denote the speciﬁc heat capacity at constant speciﬁc volume and constant pressure, respectively. The following considerations will develop the above and more general derivations towards the acoustic characteristics. A detailed introduction to acoustics may, for example, be found in the textbook by Rienstra and Hirschberg. The assumption of isentropic acoustic perturbations simpliﬁes the momentum equation (2.02) to the inviscid Euler equation ρdui dt + ∂p ∂xi = 0. (2.06) Many acoustical applications are characterized by small disturbancesq′ compared to the tempo- ral mean qm, decomposing a varying quantityq as q = qm +q′. Considering only the ﬂuctuating parts of the continuity and the inviscid momentum equation ((2.01) and (2.06), respectively) and neglecting higher order terms yields: dmρ′ dt +ρm ∂u′ i ∂xi = 0 (2.07) and ρm dmu′ i dt + ∂p′ ∂xi = 0, (2.08) where dm ·/dt denotes the material derivative with respect to the mean ﬂow um,i. 2.01 Revisiting the Literature In the case of isentropic compression, which is given in lossless acoustics ﬂows, the ﬂuctuation in pressure p′ and density ρ′ correlate linearly via p′ = ∂p ∂ρ ⏐⏐⏐⏐ s ρ′ = c 2ρ′, (2.09) where c = √ γRTm is the speed of sound and γ = cp/cv denotes the heat capacity ratio. Finally, thewave equation results from Eqs. (2.07), (2.08), and (2.09) and only obtains the unknown pressure ﬂuctuation: d 2 m p′ dt 2 −c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂xi ∂xi. (2.010) For one-dimensional plane acoustic waves, the wave equation can be factorized: (dm dt +c ∂ ∂xi )(dm dt −c ∂ ∂xi ) p′ = 0. (2.011) The resulting equation reveals two independent convection equations: One wave travels down- stream and the other upstream with a velocity of c ±um, respectively. The Riemann invariants describe the corresponding characteristic waves (f and g-wave): f = p′ ρmc +u′ (2.012) and g = p′ ρmc −u′. (2.013) The reverse relation for the ﬂuctuation in pressure p′ and velocity u′ directly follows: p′ ρmc = 1 ( f +g ) (2.014) and u′ = 1 ( f −g ). (2.015) 2.01.02 Overview on Dissipative Acoustic Formulations In 1868, Kirchhoff formulated an exact solution to the propagation of sound in a uniform circular tube. He considered an ideal gas and accounted for both effects of viscosity and thermal conductivity. Stinson gave a valuable overview of the method by Kirchhoff. However, the analytical correlations are complex, and solving for the speciﬁc acoustic proﬁles requires the use of numerical methods. Although the approach by Kirchhoff is generally valid, numerous researchers introduced simpliﬁcations. Many of these methods are based on a separate treatment of viscous and thermal effects, which are subsequently superimposed (e.g. Zwicker and Kosten or Kinsler and Frey ). Oth- ers suggest mathematical simpliﬁcations for different limiting cases (e.g. for narrow or wide Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation channels, Stinson ). Therefore, the geometrical restriction of Kirchhoff’s original solution may be relaxed (i.e. the circular shape of the tube). In their textbook “Fundamentals of Acoustics”, Kinsler and Frey dedicated one chapter to the “Absorption and Attenuation of Sound”. They divided the dissipation sources into two general categories: “(i) those intrinsic to the medium and (ii) those associated with the bound- aries of the medium”. Losses in the medium specify viscous losses, heat conduction losses, and further internal molecular processes that are all independent of an external inﬂuence (e.g. a wall). For this literature review and the scope of the thesis (i.e. viscous losses generated at the resonator walls), the focus lies on the latter category. It particularly lies on losses attributed to the ﬂuid-wall interaction and the associated viscous and thermal boundary layers. For either category, Kinsler and Frey formulated a spatial absorption coefﬁcient and a complex-valued wavenumber.1 In general, the spatial absorption coefﬁcient depends on fre- quency (e.g. frequency changes the boundary layer thickness). The phase speed cp describes the velocity of a perturbation at a certain frequency. In this context, Kinsler and Frey dis- cussed the concept of a complex-valued speed of sound for mono-frequent acoustic waves. As part of this thesis, the subsequent derivations of characteristic waves will also lead to a complex- valued wavenumber and a complex-valued speed of sound (see Sec. 2.02). Kinsler and Frey analyzed losses at rigid walls for dissipative duct and channel ﬂows via boundary layer theory. As a speciﬁc example, they discussed losses in wide pipes where boundary layers are much smaller than the tube diameter. Fluid disks with boundary layers were used to describe the local ﬂow properties. Viscous and thermal losses were considered separately and recombined by superposition of the individual absorption coefﬁcient. Kinsler and Frey’s remarkable conclusions included that “the presence of the viscous boundary layer also modiﬁes the phase speed of the acoustic wave”. This leads to a distortion of a broadband signal or a (complex-valued) speed of sound for mono-frequent excitation. Fur- thermore, the reactance (a comprehensive deﬁnition and application follows in Chapter 3) is affected by the viscosity, such that “the apparent mass of the ﬂuid disk is slightly larger. This is equivalent to the ﬂuid having a slightly greater density.” Numerous authors presented very similar or even identical approaches and formulations to Kinsler and Frey (compare, e.g. the textbook “Acoustics - An Introduction to Its Phys- ical Principles and Applications” by Pierce ). Keefe considered a smooth cylindrical duct and emphasized the exact nature of Kirch- hoff’s derivation. As a novelty, his work offered approximations that also hold with good accuracy in the critical transition zones (boundary layers in the order of magnitude of the tube diameter). If the acoustic frequency is sufﬁciently low, there is only a single plane mode that travels over axial distances that are large compared to the tube diameter. Considering isothermal walls, Keefe related the pressure and volume ﬂow rate oscillations via the acoustic series impedance and the shunt admittance. In their combination, they yield the complex-valuedchar- acteristic impedance and the propagation wavenumber. Again, there is a close similarity to nu- 1 Both deﬁnitions will reappear during the derivations of Sec. 2.02 and are therefore not closer speciﬁed in the present section. Also, further characteristics (e.g. of the acoustic impedance, reactance, etc.) that are only brieﬂy introduced in the present literature review, will be presented in more detail alongside their mathmatical deﬁnitions throughout the later course of this work. 2.01 Revisiting the Literature merous previous deﬁnitions where the losses drive a spatial decay (mathematically described by a complex-valued wavenumber or (alternatively) by a complex-valued phase velocity or speed of sound, e.g. Kinsler and Frey ). As a ﬁnal remark on the work by Keefe, it is worth to mention the physical interpreta- tion of the real- and imaginary-valued part of the series impedance and the shunt admittance: He interpreted these four parameters in the same way as Rott and Swift (introduced in Sec. 2.01.03) as the inertance, resistance, compliance, and conductance. Thus, the selected con- servation equations of this thesis based on Rott’s framework will also be identical to those by Keefe. The studies of Hynninen and Abom built on Keefe’s formulations and connected the framework of acoustic losses with transfer/scattering matrices and the idea of traveling waves. Viscous friction and heat exchange with a solid substrate generated the losses. The sub- strate was modeled as an aggregation of capillary tubes via a speciﬁc impedance. Similar to Kinsler and Frey’s work, Hynninen and Abom derived a complex-valued speed of sound and a complex-valued density. Until today, the research on boundary layer losses in the characteristic wave framework (see Sec. 2.01.03) is limited. Indeed, Hynninen and Abom only implicitly pointed in this direction: They formulated a transfer matrix and formally gave instructions to derive the scat- tering matrix. The scattering matrix related the upstream and downstream traveling pressure waves, which closely compare to the characteristic f and g-waves. However, there was nei- ther a clear statement of how these relations were used nor a physical discussion of the spatial perturbations. Gobin gave a ﬁrst review and formulation that centrally focused on characteristic waves with losses. In line with all the previous authors, the problem at hand was tackled via the math- ematical use of a complex-valued wavenumber. In contrast to the following derivations of the present thesis (see Sec. 2.02), the study by Gobin allowed for a non-zero mean ﬂow that led to propagation velocities at cp ±um. In agreement with Kinsler and Frey, the speed of sound was interpreted as a decreased (complex-valued) phase velocity. Gobin referenced Kinsler and Frey’s formulations to determine the loss-related (imaginary- valued) component of the wavenumber. The characteristic f and g-waves corresponded to the respective traveling pressure perturbations (compare Hynninen and Abom ). In a ﬁnal step, Gobin formulated a transfer matrix to couple the pressure and velocity perturbations ( p′ and u′, respectively) at the in- and outlet of a duct. However, Gobin stated a constant factor ofρc between pressure p′ and velocity u′. This contra- dicts prior conclusions by Kinsler and Frey, who found that viscous and thermal dissipation will increase local density. Alternatively, in a more intuitive interpretation, pressure gradients need to increase to compensate for the friction and to maintain constant velocity amplitudes. This missing correction in the study by Gobin will show in the subsequent derivation of the present thesis (see Sec. 2.02). Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation 2.01.03 Rott’s Thermoacoustic Theory In 1980, Rott introduced a (thermo-)acoustic approximation for channel ﬂows. As a ﬁrst and important difference to the inviscid and isentropic derivations presented in Sec. 2.01.01, Rott’s theory includes the viscous and thermal impact of the surrounding walls on the ﬂuid, a crucial aspect for the dissipating characteristics of an acoustic resonator (see Chapter 3). The second difference lies in the more general perspective that allows axial temperature gradients, a crucial aspect for the occurrence of heat transfer (see Chapter 4). This section outlines the fundamentals of Rott’s approximation that are of relevance throughout the course of this thesis. The work by Rott included the following assumption: • an ideal gas is assumed (consistent with the isentropic derivations in Sec. 2.01.01), • the ﬂow is laminar and without mean-ﬂow (i.e. in comparison to the more general for- mulation of Sec. 2.01.01, um = 0 is assumed as an addition constraint), • the wall temperature is spatially non-uniform but temporally constant (i.e. its heat capac- ity is very large compared to the gaseous working ﬂuid), and • the acoustic wavelength is (much) larger than the displacement amplitude and the bound- ary layer thickness. The last assumption allows to consider the diffusive effects imposed by the geometry via two integrated parameters fν and fκ (for hydrodynamic and thermal wall-effects, respectively). Thereby, the longitudinal velocity oscillations are described by the cross-sectional volume ﬂow rate since the velocity proﬁle varies in wall-normal direction. Periodical and sinusoidal oscillations of a (in the acoustic framework small) quantity q are classically deﬁned as q(t) = qa cos(ωt +ϕ), (2.016) where ω = 2πf denotes the angular frequency and f the (ordinary) frequency. The amplitude of the oscillation qa and the temporal phase of the oscillationϕ are arbitrary constants that depend on the initial conditions of the problem at hand. Oftentimes, it is more convenient to rewrite Eq. (2.016) in the complex notation q(t) = Re [ q 1 eiωt ], (2.017) where the complex-valued amplitude q 1 combines the two prior parameters qa and ϕ such that the absolute of q 1 is ⏐⏐q 1 ⏐⏐= qa and its respective phase is ̸ q 1 = ϕ. The subscript 1 denotes the ﬁrst-order characteristic of the small parameterq 1 itself (whereas e.g. “small squared” terms are called second-order). The identity eiα = cosα+i sinα exploits the deﬁnition of the exponential function with imaginary-valued input arguments (i.e. i = p −1). Rott introduced the complex-valued pressure and velocity amplitudes p 1 and u 1 as the respec- tively primary acoustic variables. Furthermore, the volume ﬂow rate U 1 calculates the integral 2.01 Revisiting the Literature of the velocity u 1 over the cross-sectional area A of the channel. Rott summarized all relevant variables and parameters as follows: p = pm + Re [ p 1(x)eiωt ] U = Re [ U 1(x)eiωt ] u = Re [ u 1(x, y, z)eiωt ] T = Tm(x) + Re [ T 1(x, y, z)eiωt ] ρ = similar to T ν = ν(x) c, κ, etc. = similar to ν, (2.018) where ν = µ/ρ denotes the kinematic viscosity and κ = k/(ρcp) the thermal diffusivity. Note the spatially uniform mean temperature Tm throughout the ﬁrst derivations in Sec. 2.02. Thus, for an ideal gas, the density ρm is also constant in space. In the later course of the thesis, this restriction is relaxed to linear and exponential temperature proﬁles Tm(x) (Sec. 2.03 and 2.06, respectively). However, these derivations are only valid for (theoretical) ﬂuids with constant kinematic viscosity ν ̸= ν(T ). Considering the boundary conditions at the wall surfaces and integrating the velocity u 1 over the channel cross-section to obtain the volume ﬂow rate U 1 yields the momentum equation of Rott’s acoustic approximation: dp 1 = −iωρm dx/A 1 − fν U 1, (2.019) with the alternative formulation: ∂(U′/A) ∂t ρm a⋆ + ∂p′ ∂x = 0, (2.020) where the parameter a⋆ = 1 − fν is introduced for a more compact notation. The mean temper- ature gradient d Tm/dx does not affect the momentum equation. The derivation of the continuity equation follows a similar (though slightly more complicated) procedure and requires the mean cross-sectional temperature. For arbitrary cross sections, it reads: d U 1 = −iωA dx γρm [ 1 +(γ−1)fκ ] p 1 + (fκ − fν) (1 − fν)(1 −Pr) d Tm Tm U 1, (2.021) with the alternative formulation: ∂p′ ∂t b⋆ γpm + ∂(U′/A) ∂x − d⋆ Tm d Tm dx (U′/A) = 0, (2.022) where the parameters b⋆ = [ 1 +(γ−1)fκ ] and d⋆ = [ (fκ − fν) ] / [ (1 − fν)(1 −Pr) ] are introduced for a more compact notation. Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation The functions fν and fκ are known for different geometries. For a channel ﬂow (channel width of 2 rh), they read: fν/κ = tanh[(1 +i)rh/δν/κ] (1 +i)rh/δν/κ. (2.023) For a circular duct, fν/κ are deﬁned as fν/κ = 2 J 1 [ (i −1) 2 rh δν/κ ] J 0 [ (i −1) 2 rh δν/κ ] (i −1) 2 rh δν/κ, (2.024) where J 0 and J 1 are Bessel functions (ﬁrst kind) of the zeroth and ﬁrst order, respectively. The hydraulic radius is denoted by rh ≡ A Π, (2.025) where A denotes the cross-sectional area of the channel and Π its perimeter. The hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness δν (also known as “Stokes boundary layer”) is δν = p 2ν/ω (2.026) and its thermal analog δκ is δκ = p 2κ/ω. (2.027) They describe the respective hydrodynamic and thermal penetration depth of wall-effects on oscillatory ﬂows. The Prandtl number Pr deﬁnes the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity: Pr ≡ ν κ. (2.028) Thereby it also relates the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thickness of Eqs. (2.026) and (2.027). All further derivations in the subsequent course of this chapter will be based on the conservation equations of Rott’s thermoacoustic theory as presented above. 2.02 Characteristic Waves with Losses at Homogeneous Tem- perature This section applies the derivation of the Riemann invariants (as presented by Polifke et al ) to the conservation equations of Rott’s thermoacoustic theory. In agreement with the work by Rott, the velocity proﬁle has no mean ﬂow. This ﬁrst instance of derivation considers a spatially uniform temperature proﬁle for a channel with a constant cross-sectional area. The extension to linear temperature proﬁles follows in Sec. 2.03. The derivation in Sec. 2.02.01 yields a general solution independent from the additional boundary and initial conditions. Section 2.02.02 elaborates on the speciﬁc solution for a quarter-wave chan- nel. Results for the uniform temperature are presented alongside those for linear temperature proﬁles in Sec. 2.04. 2.02 Characteristic Waves with Losses at Homogeneous Temperature 2.02.01 The General Derivation Polifke et al presented linear partial differential equations with two variables Aux +But = 0, (2.029) where the subscripts x and t denote the derivatives in space and time, respectively. Using the perfect gas lawpm = ρm RTm and the speed of soundc = √ γRTm, Rott’s conservation equation (Eqs. (2.020) and (2.022), ) are rewritten and rearranged: d ( p′ ρmc ) dx + 1 a⋆c d ( U′ A ) dt = 0 (2.030) and d ( U′ A ) dx + b⋆ c d ( p′ ρmc ) dt = 0, (2.031) where the constants a⋆ and b⋆ incorporate the effects of viscous and thermal boundary layers (compare to the deﬁnition in Sec.2.01.03). Note the omission of the term that includes the local temperature gradient in the continuity equation. This signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the problem at hand. Thereby, the mathematical form of Rott’s conservation equations is identical to those of numerous researchers (e.g. Keefe, compare Sec. 2.01.02). The corresponding matrices A and B and the vector u read: A = [1 0 0 1 ], (2.032) B = [ 0 1 a⋆c b⋆ c 0 ], (2.033) and u = [ p′ ρmc U′ A ]. (2.034) In particular, the vector u strongly resembles the deﬁnition in the derivation by Polifke et al. : Merely the velocity u′ is replaced by the spatially averaged velocity over the cross- sectional area U′/A. (Since u′ locally varies in wall-normal due to boundary effects.) The eigenvalues λ and eigenvectors s of this problem (AT s = λBT s) are: λ± = ±c √ a⋆ b⋆ (2.035) and s± = [ 1 ± √ a⋆b⋆ ]. (2.036) Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation According to Polifke et al, the problem is of hyperbolic type if the eigenvalues λ± are real-valued. This is required to reduce the system to the characteristic normal form. Although the eigenvalues λ± are not real-valued in the present work 2, the corresponding reduction yields: d dt p′ ρmc ± √ a⋆b⋆ d dt U′ A = 0 (2.037) and is valid along the characteristics propagating at dx dt = ±c √ a⋆ b⋆. (2.038) Note at this point: Without dissipation ( fν and fκ → 0), the acoustic disturbances would propa- gate into the positive and negative direction at the speed of soundc. With dissipation, a complex- valued speed of sound (e.g. cp, compare Sec. 2.01.02) reappears and it is smaller (in the absolute and real part) than the lossless speed of sound c. The characteristic wave amplitudes (that now vary in space) read: f = p′ ρmc + √ a⋆b⋆ U′ A (2.039) and g = p′ ρmc − √ a⋆b⋆ U′ A. (2.040) From the present state of understanding and the mathematical perspective, the independence of f and g is maintained. In particular, for uniform temperature distributions, an upstream traveling f -wave does not scatter to a downstream traveling g-wave, and vice versa. In alignment with the procedure described in Polifke et al, the Riemann invariants are interpreted as harmonic (and now spatially decaying) waves and introduce p′ ρmc = ˆPe (iωt−ik x x) (2.041) and U′ A = ˆUe (iωt−ik x x). (2.042) Note that the wavenumberkx may be complex-valued to model a spatially decaying behavior at- tributed to viscous and thermal losses. Introducing the deﬁnition of the wavenumberk = ω/c to describe the harmonic oscillation of an inviscid and non-heat-conducting reference, Eqs. (2.030) and (2.031) reduce to matrix notation [kb⋆ −kx −kx k/a⋆ ][ ˆP ˆU ] = [0 ], (2.043) where ˆP and ˆU are constant amplitudes at a reference position x = 0. 2 Despite the complex-valued eigenvalues the characteristic waves are independent. However, as it will become apparent in the course of the present section, they exhibit a spatial decay. 2.02 Characteristic Waves with Losses at Homogeneous Temperature The determinant of the above matrix is zero if kx± = ±k √ b⋆ a⋆. (2.044) Reinserting the expression of the complex-valued wavenumber kx± into the matrix equation above yields the ratio of the amplitudes ˆP and ˆU: ˆU = ± p a⋆b⋆ ˆP. (2.045) Note: At this point, the increased density (or equivalently pressure) that was predicted by Kinsler and Frey shows in the presence of losses: Without any viscous or thermal dis- sipation (fν and fκ → 0), the factor between velocity u′ and pressure p′ is ρmc. With losses, the square-root expression is smaller than 1, indicating the increase in the pressure-to-velocity ratio (an increased pressure is required to compensate the losses). Gobin did not consider this factor in his thesis (compare Sec. 2.01.02). The amplitudes of the upstream and downstream traveling waves are deﬁned as ˆP+ ≡ ˆF/2 and ˆP− ≡ ˆG/2 to obtain the solutions p′ ρmc = f 2 + g = ˆF 2 e(iωt−ik x+x) + ˆG 2 e(iωt−ik x−x) (2.046) and U′ A = p a⋆b⋆ (f 2 − g ) = p a⋆b⋆ ( ˆF 2 e(iωt−ik x+x) − ˆG 2 e(iωt−ik x−x) ). (2.047) Along the characteristic dx dt = ±c p a⋆/b⋆, the term ωt − kx±x (argument to the exponential function) is constant. Integration of the characteristic yields: x(t) = ±c √ a⋆ b⋆ t +C±, (2.048) where C± is a constant. Rewriting the (temporal and spatial dependent) exponent yields: ωt −kx±x = k √ b⋆ a⋆C± = const. (2.049) and shows that the latter expression neither depends on the time t nor the axial location x. The ﬁnal expression for the Riemann invariants f and g for the one-dimensional system with viscous and thermal dissipation (no mean ﬂow, not temperature gradient, isothermal walls) for Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation L x Tm|x=0 = T 1 Tm|x=L = T 2 U′|x=0 = 0 p′|x=L = 0 2 rh Figure 2.01: Geometry and boundary conditions of a quarter-wave channel. the acoustic pressure and velocity (averaged over the cross-sectional area) read: f = ˆF exp(iωt −ik x+x) = ˆF exp  k √ b⋆ a⋆C+   = ˆF exp  iω  t − √ b⋆ a⋆ x c    . (2.050) and g = ˆG exp(iωt −ik x−x) = ˆG exp  k √ b⋆ a⋆C−   = ˆG exp  iω  t + √ b⋆ a⋆ x c    . (2.051) Finally, note the perfect consistency between the “conventional” characteristic formulation in and the present equations for the inviscid and non-heat-conducting limiting case when neither hydrodynamic nor thermal boundary layers exist and the parametersa⋆ and b⋆ approach unity: a⋆ → 1 and b⋆ → 1. This implies that: 1. the complex-valued wavenumber kx± reduces to the real-valued wavenumber k = ω/c, 2. the complex-valued phase speed that deﬁnes the characteristic dx/dt reduces to the real- valued speed of sound c = √ γRTm, and that 3. the friction-induced increase in pressure vanishes ( ˆU = ±ˆP). 2.02.02 Application to a Quarter-Wave Channel In this section, the equations derived in Sec. 2.02.01 (characteristic waves with losses) are applied to a quarter-wave channel, depicted in Fig. 2.01. The channel of length L has a closed end at 2.02 Characteristic Waves with Losses at Homogeneous Temperature the location x = 0, suppressing the axial volume ﬂow at this node ( U′|x=0 = 0). At the channel mouth (x = L), the large area jump to the surrounding implies a pressure node (p′|x=L = 0). The mean temperature along the channel axis is constant with T 1 = T 2 = Tm. Linear temperature proﬁles follow in Sec. 2.03. The parameters fν and fκ consider the cross-sectional geometry of the channel. Thus, the following derivation is independent of further speciﬁcations in this respect. Equations (2.046) and (2.047) state the local pressure and volume ﬂow ﬂuctuation, respectively. The boundary conditions at either side of the channel (atx = 0 and x = L, as stated above) deﬁne the complex-valued amplitudes ˆF and ˆG. At the closed end ( x = 0, velocity node), Eq. (2.047) reads: U′ A = p a⋆b⋆   ˆF 2 exp  iωt −iω √ b⋆ a⋆ x|0 c  − ˆG 2 exp  iωt +iω √ b⋆ a⋆ x|0 c    = 0. (2.052) At the open end (x = L, pressure node), Eq. (2.046) reads: p′ ρmc = ˆF 2 exp  iωt −iω √ b⋆ a⋆ x|L c  + ˆG 2 exp  iωt +iω √ b⋆ a⋆ x|L c  = 0. (2.053) Note that the solution of both, Eqs. (2.052) and (2.053) respectively, is independent of the time t (the expression exp(iωt) cancels out for the non-trivial solution at t < ∞). The linear system of equations is solvable when its determinant vanishes, which yields the following relationship for the eigenfrequency ω: exp  i ω c √ b⋆ a⋆ 2 L  +1 = 0. (2.054) For the inviscid and non-heat-conducting case (a⋆ → 1 and b⋆ → 1), the solution for the eigen- frequencies is real-valued and spatially repeats at multiples of the wavelength traveling at the speed of sound c. For the case of hydrodynamic and thermal wall interaction, the expressionp b⋆/a⋆ is complex-valued. This directly indicates complex-valued eigenfrequencies with ex- ponential decay of the oscillation amplitude in time. Solving for the oscillation amplitudes ˆF and ˆG, Eq. (2.052) directly implies for x = 0: ˆF = ˆG. (2.055) The deﬁnition of boundary conditions fully speciﬁes the problem at hand. For later compara- bility with the work by Sujith et al, the pressure p′ is speciﬁed at the closed end of the channel (x = 0) and at time t = 0: p′|x=0, t=0 ≡ P 1. (2.056) Evaluating Eq. (2.046) for the initial condition ﬁnally yields the solution for the parameters ˆF and ˆG: ˆF = ˆG = P 1 ρmc. (2.057) The derivation above deﬁnes acoustic eigenvalues in a quarter-wave channel with a homoge- neous temperature distribution in the presence of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation A boundary condition fully deﬁnes the ﬂow rate and pressure proﬁles. The following Sec. 2.03 extends the homogeneous temperature distribution to a linear proﬁle. Numerical results of the present, more restrictive formulation are not shown in this section, but alongside the results of the more general derivations of the subsequent section. 2.03 Extending to Linear Temperature Proﬁles at Constant Kinematic Viscosity This section extends the derivations in the previous section to a more general set-up of linear temperature proﬁles. As indicated in Fig. 2.01, the temperature varies linearly between T 1 at the closed end and T 2 at the mouth of the channel. As in the previous set-up with uniform temperature, a general solution independent of boundary and initial conditions is derived ﬁrst (Sec. 2.03.01). The subsequent Sec. 2.03.02 presents the speciﬁc solution for a quarter-wave channel. Numerical results and discussion follow in Sec. 2.04. Section 2.06 outlines a solution strategy for exponential temperature distributions. Solutions to other temperature proﬁles (quadratic, polynomial, etc.) may exist and can be considered in future work. Compared to the previous analysis, the linear temperature proﬁle signiﬁcantly complicates the problem at hand. Note the additional non-zero term in the continuity equation (2.022). Further- more, the mean local density ρm and the speed of sound c vary in space. In consequence, the previous approach for homogeneous temperature is not applicable. The present work assumes a temperature-independent Prandtl number Pr. Furthermore, the so- lution is restricted to ﬂuids with a kinematic viscosity ν that does not change with temperature. However, for general gaseous ﬂuids (e.g. air), empirical correlations show such temperature dependence. E.g. Sutherland’s law suggests ν(T ) = ν∞ ( T T∞ )1+β, (2.058) where β ≈ 0.07 and ν∞ and T∞ are a reference viscosity and temperate, respectively. Therefore, the following derivations should be regarded from a more mathematical and theoretical perspec- tive. They are not expected to give quantitatively accurate results if temperature gradients and the inﬂuence of viscosity are signiﬁcant. 2.03.01 The General Derivation The general derivations of this section are again based on the conservation equations of Rott’s thermoacoustic theory (Eqs. (2.020) and (2.022)) and closely follow an approach suggested by Su- jith et al. Sujith et al derived exact solutions for one-dimensional acoustic ﬁelds in ducts with an axial temperature gradient: Since the wave equation has variable coefﬁcients, exact so- lutions for an arbitrary temperature proﬁle cannot be obtained. Instead, the differential equation is transformed from the physical x-space to the local temperature space of a speciﬁc presumed temperature distribution. Sujith et al successfully provided a solution for linear and expo- nential temperature proﬁles. Subsequent studies added solutions for quadratic and polynomial 2.03 Extending to Linear Temperature Proﬁles at Constant Kinematic Viscosity distributions. However, the work by Sujith and coworkers is limited to inviscid and non-heat-conducting gases. The present approach considers to the impact of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers considered by Rott’s thermoacoustic theory. The analysis begins with the one-dimensional ﬁrst-order momentum and continuity equations by Rott (see Eqs. (2.020) and (2.022), rearranged): ∂(U′/A) ∂t + a⋆ ρm ∂p′ ∂x = 0 (2.059) and b⋆ γpm ∂p′ ∂t + ∂(U′/A) ∂x − d⋆ Tm d Tm dx (U′/A) = 0. (2.060) Differentiating the momentum equation with respect to the axial location x and the continuity equation with respect to the timet and eliminating the cross-derivative term yields a differential equation with variable coefﬁcients: b⋆ γpm ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 − a⋆ ρm ∂2 p′ ∂x 2 + a⋆ ρ2 m ∂ρm ∂x ∂p′ ∂x − d⋆ Tm d Tm dx ∂(U′/A) ∂t = 0. (2.061) Note that this step requires the assumption of a constant kinematic viscosity ν: In general, the parameter a⋆ of the momentum equation (2.059) depends on the position x (via the local temperature Tm, which affects the viscosity). Thus, differentiating with respect to the axial location x would lead to an additional term that cannot be handled in the further derivation. This term drops under the assumption of a constant viscosity ν. Differentiating the steady equation of state (pm = ρm RTm) and recalling that the steady channel pressure pm is constant along the directionx (no mean ﬂow) yields a relation between the steady temperature and density: ρm dρm dx + 1 Tm d Tm dx = 0. (2.062) Simplifying Eq. (2.061) with Eq. (2.062) and substituting the derivative of the volume ﬂow rate via the momentum equation (Eq. (2.059)) gives: b⋆ γpm ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 − a⋆ ρm ∂2 p′ ∂x 2 − a⋆ ρm Tm d Tm dx ∂p′ ∂x + d⋆ Tm d Tm dx a⋆ ρm ∂p′ ∂x = 0, (2.063) where only the pressurep′ remains as a ﬁrst-order acoustic property. Replacing the mean density via the equation of state and further rearrangements yields: ∂2 p′ ∂x 2 + (1 −d⋆) Tm d Tm dx ∂p′ ∂x − b⋆ a⋆ γRTm ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 = 0. (2.064) Assuming that the solution has a periodic time dependence (i.e.p′(x, t) = p 1(x)eiωt ), Eq. (2.064) reduces to the following second order differential equation for the complex-valued amplitude p 1(x): d 2 p 1 dx 2 + (1 −d⋆) Tm d Tm dx dp 1 dx + b⋆ a⋆ ω2 γRTm p 1 = 0. (2.065) Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation Equation (2.065) has variable coefﬁcients. Therefore, general analytical solutions for an arbitrary mean temperate proﬁle Tm(x) cannot be obtained. Instead, a temperature proﬁle is presumed and two transformations will lead to a Sturm-Liouville equation (see Eq. 2.074). The ﬁrst trans- formation of Eq. (2.065) from the physical x-space to the temperature space Tm(x) yields: (d Tm dx )2 d 2 p 1 d T 2 m + d 2 Tm dx 2 dp 1 d Tm + (1 −d⋆) Tm (d Tm dx )2 dp 1 d Tm + b⋆ a⋆ ω2 γRTm p 1 = 0. (2.066) No assumptions on the mean temperate proﬁle Tm(x) were made up to this point of the deriva- tion. In the following, a linear temperature proﬁle is assumed: Tm(x) = T 0 +mx, (2.067) and thus d Tm dx = m and d 2 Tm dx 2 = 0. (2.068) Section 2.06 outlines a solution strategy for an exponential temperature proﬁle. Using the linear properties from Eqs. (2.067) and (2.068) to simplify the transformed second order differential equation (Eq. (2.066)) yields: d 2 p 1 d T 2 m + (1 −d⋆) Tm dp 1 d Tm + b⋆ a⋆ ω2/m 2 γRTm p 1 = 0. (2.069) For further simpliﬁcation of Eq. (2.069), a new independent variable s is introduced: s = 2 √ ω2 c⋆ m 2γR √ Tm, (2.070) where c⋆ = b⋆ a⋆ (2.071) and the ﬁrst and second derivative of s with respect to the temperature Tm read: ds d Tm = √ ω2 c⋆ m 2γR 1 p Tm (2.072) and d 2 s d T 2 m = −1 √ ω2 c⋆ m 2γR 1√ T 3 m. (2.073) Again, note the underlying assumption of a temperature-independent kinematic viscosity ν and constant Prandtl number Pr, which implies that the parameter c⋆ does not change with respect to the temperature Tm. Transforming Eq. (2.069) from the Tm to the s-space yields: d 2 p 1 ds 2 + (1 −2 d⋆) s dp 1 ds +p 1 = 0, (2.074) 2.03 Extending to Linear Temperature Proﬁles at Constant Kinematic Viscosity which is a Sturm-Liouville equation. The solution of this equation is known: p 1 = sd⋆ [c 1 Jd⋆(s) +c 2 Yd⋆(s)] = (ω a √ Tm )d⋆ [ c 1 Jd⋆ (ω a √ Tm ) +c 2 Yd⋆ (ω a √ Tm )], (2.075) where c 1 and c 2 are complex-valued constants. Jd⋆ and Yd⋆ are the Bessel functions of ﬁrst and second kind, respectively. Note that both functions are of complex-valued order d⋆. The constant a is deﬁned as a = |m| √ γR c⋆. (2.076) Finally, the momentum equation (Eq. (2.059)) yields the acoustic volume ﬂow U 1, based on the derived pressure distribution p 1 (Eq. (2.075)): U 1 A = − a⋆ iωρm dp 1 dx = i a⋆ ωρm d T dx dp 1 d T = m |m| i p a⋆b⋆ ρm √ γRTm sd⋆ [c 1 Jd⋆−1(s) +c 2 Yd⋆−1(s)] = m |m| i p a⋆b⋆ ρm √ γRTm (ω a √ Tm )d⋆ [ c 1 Jd⋆−1 (ω a √ Tm ) +c 2 Yd⋆−1 (ω a √ Tm )]. (2.077) For an inviscid and non-heat-conducting gas (a⋆ → 1, b⋆ → 1, c⋆ → 1, and d⋆ → 0), the present analysis for the acoustic pressure and volume ﬂow rate perfectly resembles the results obtained by Sujith et al. In this particular case, Eq. (2.074) is a zeroth order Bessel’s differential equation. Consequently, the Bessel functions in the solution for pressure and velocity (Eq. (2.075) and (2.077)) are of zeroth and ﬁrst order, respectively. 2.03.02 Application to a quarter-wave channel In this section, the equations for a linear temperature gradient derived in Sec. 2.03.01 are applied to the quarter-wave channel depicted in Fig. 2.01. The general set-up corresponds to the description given in Sec. 2.02.02, except that the temperature proﬁle under investigation describes a linear characteristic between T 1 at the closed end and T 2 at the mouth of the channel. The pressure and velocity amplitudes need to satisfy the respective boundary conditions at either end of the channel (i.e. U 1 = 0 at x = 0 where Tm = T 1 and p 1 = 0 at x = L where Tm = T 2, respectively): c 1 Jd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ) +c 2 Yd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ) = 0 (2.078) and c 1 Jd⋆ (ω a √ T 2 ) +c 2 Yd⋆ (ω a √ T 2 ) = 0. (2.079) This system of homogeneous equations is only solvable, when its determinant vanishes. Thus, all eigenfrequencies of the channel fulﬁll the mathematical relation Jd⋆ (ω a √ T 2 ) Yd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ) −Jd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ) Yd⋆ (ω a √ T 2 ) = 0. (2.080) Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation Finally, the acoustic pressure amplitude p′|x=0, t=0 = p 1|x=0 ≡ P 1 is deﬁned as the initial condi- tion. The unknown constants c 1 and c 2 from Eqs. (2.078) and (2.079) follow: c 1 = πωp T 1 2 a (ω a p T 1 )d⋆ P 1 Yd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ) (2.081) and c 2 = πωp T 1 2 a (ω a p T 1 )d⋆ P 1 Jd⋆−1 (ω a √ T 1 ). (2.082) Again, for the inviscid and non-heat-conducting limiting case ( c⋆ → 1, and d⋆ → 0), the equa- tions of this section perfectly match those derived by Sujith et al. The equations above clearly show that the present problem at hand (including the temperature gradient) does not allow a decoupled treatment via two independent characteristic waves that travel in the downstream and upstream direction with their respective propagation velocities. Instead, the acoustic perturbations are described by a (far more complicated) superposition of Bessel functions (compare Eqns. (2.075) and (2.077)). 2.04 Results This section presents numerical results based on the previous derivations on uniform (Sec. 2.02) and linear (Sec. 2.03) temperature proﬁles. Over a wide parametric range of temperatures (Sec. 2.04.01), this Section reports the respective eigenfrequencies (Sec. 2.04.02) as well as pres- sure and velocity proﬁles (Sec. 2.04.03). 2.04.01 Parametric Set-Up To faciliate a comparison, values selected for the channel length L = 4 m, the temperature at channel mouth T 2 = 300 K, and the pressure magnitude at the closed end P 1 = 2000 Pa agree with the work by Sujith et al. The temperature range T 1 also follows the study by Sujith from 300 K to 1100 K at the closed end of the channel. Furthermore, the present study extends the parameter range to temperatures below the mouth temperature of T 2 = 300 K, yielding the range T 1 = [100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 700, 900, 1100 ]K. Sujith and coworkers do not elaborate on the product of heat capacity ratio γ and the speciﬁc gas constant R. However, the evaluation of eigenfrequencies yieldsγR = 402.05 m 2 s 2 K. This motivates the selection of air-speciﬁc valuesγ = 1.04 and R = 287.05 m 2 s 2 K in the present study. The mean pressure along the channel is reconstructed by the ratio of acoustic pressure and velocity amplitude to pm = 101325 Pa. Expanding the scope to the effect of viscous and thermal boundary layers, this work investigates acoustics in the geometry of a (two-dimensional) channel ﬂow between two conﬁning parallel plates at the (hydraulic) distance of 2 rh. The geometric parameter rh controls the magnitude of impact that the boundary layers exert on the ﬂuid. In contrast, the kinematic viscosity ν = 1.0516×10−5 m 2 s and the Prandtl number Pr = 0.0711 are constant. 2.04 Results Figure 2.02: First eigenfrequency ω for different temperatures T 1 and channel widths rh. The parameters fν and fκ from Eq. (2.023) specify the geometric shape of the channel ﬂow. Note that other geometries (circular/rectangular ducts, etc.) can easily be investigated by their corresponding geometric functions. 2.04.02 Evaluation of Eigenfrequencies This section presents the numerical evaluation of the ﬁrst three acoustic eigenfrequencies ω0 in a quarter-wave channel. Equation (2.054) (uniform temperature distribution, T 1 = T 2) and Eq. (2.080) (linear temperature distribution, T 1 ̸= T 2) are minimized with respect to the real- and imaginary-valued part of the frequency ω. The necessity to evaluate complex-ordered Bessel functions suggested using the software “Mathematica”. The parametric set-up follows the description of the previous Sec. 2.04.01. Figures 2.02 to 2.04 display the development of the ﬁrst three complex-valued acoustic eigenfre- quencies ω0 (the real and imaginary values are depicted on the two axis of each plot). The solid blue isolines ( ) represent instances of equal temperature distribution. The dashed red isolines ( ) indicate the channel width rh. Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation Figure 2.03: Second eigenfrequency ω for different temperatures T 1 and channel widths rh. 2.04 Results Figure 2.04: Third eigenfrequency ω for different temperatures T 1 and channel widths rh. Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation First, investigating the limiting case of very wide channels ( rh → ∞, here rh = 10 m), the complex-valued part of the eigenfrequency ω0 vanishes (see the bottom-most and unlabeled dashed line ( ) of each plot). For this consideration, the effect of the hydrodynamic and ther- mal wall-to-ﬂuid impact is negligible, yielding the inviscid and non-heat-conducting limiting case investigated by Sujith et al. Indeed, these real-valued eigenfrequencies perfectly agree between the present study and the results reported by Sujith et al. Furthermore, the qual- itative impact of the temperature distribution on the eigenfrequency is self-evident: Increasing mean-temperatures increase the speed of sound and thus the eigenfrequency of the quarter-wave channel. Turning to narrower channel widths rh, the impact of hydrodynamic and thermal losses be- comes apparent. Down to rh = 0.001 m (second dashed line ( ) from the bottom in each plot), the moderate gain in losses only triggers small shifts in eigenfrequency (real- and imaginary- valued component). Narrowing the channel down to approximatelyrh = 0.0001 m (depending on the order of the eigenfrequency), the relationship between the real- and imaginary-valued part of the eigenfrequency ω0 continues to describe linear characteristics. A bend follows where the in- crease in the imaginary-valued part of the eigenfrequency accelerates compared to the decrease in the real-valued counter-part. After this bend, a circular characteristic of the complex-valued eigenfrequency ω0 follows. The vanishing of its real part terminates the oscillatory behavior of the system. Before closing this section on eigenfrequencies, one unexpected observation is mentioned: For the two lowest temperatures T 1 = 100 K and 150 K, the ﬁrst eigenfrequencies ω0 develop dif- ferently compared to the higher temperature range. For clarity of the remaining content, these two temperatures are excluded from Fig. 2.02. At large channel widths rh, the eigenfrequencies at lower temperatures follow an expected path. However, particularly for T 1 = 100 K at medium channel widths (and thus medium real parts of ω0), the imaginary part of ω0 strongly increases. Finally, the real part of the eigenfrequency ω0 vanishes at a signiﬁcantly raised imaginary part of ω0 ≈ 600 i 1 s. This phenomenon requires further clariﬁcation, including whether boundary conditions (physically/mathematically) are always satisﬁed. 2.04.03 Evaluation of Pressure and Velocity Proﬁles In this section, pressure and velocity proﬁles ( p 1 ( ) and U 1/A ( ), respectively) are pre- sented for the ﬁrst eigenfrequency of the quarter-wave channel. Equations (2.046) and (2.047) describe the cases with homogeneous temperatures, Eqs. (2.075) and (2.077) the cases of linear temperature distributions. Figure 2.05 provides the local distribution of the absolute pressure ⏐⏐p 1 ⏐⏐ and velocity |U 1/A| for six distinct temperatures T 1 and six channel widths rh (compare the consistency of parame- ters with Fig. 2.02). For presentation, the velocity |U 1/A| is displayed as a normalized pressure |U 1/A|ρ2 c 2, where ρ2 and c 2 are the density and speed of sound at x = L where Tm = T 2. Note that boundary conditions are satisﬁed for each instance ( p′|x=0, t=0 = p 1|x=0 ≡ P 1 = 2000 Pa, U 1|x=0 = 0 and p 1|x=L = 0). The colored instances without data lie outside the parameter range of an acoustically oscillating ﬂow: The channel widthrh falls below the threshold for which the real-valued part of the eigenfrequency ω0 is larger zero (again, compare to Fig. 2.02). 2.04 Results Figure 2.05: Absolute pressure amplitude ⏐⏐p 1 ⏐⏐ ( ) and velocity amplitude |U 1/A| (, factor ρ2 c 2) for the ﬁrst eigenfrequency at different temperatures T 1 and channel widths rh. Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation Figure 2.06: Phase of pressure p 1 ( ) and velocity U 1/A ( ) for the ﬁrst eigenfrequency at different temperatures T 1 and channel widths rh. 2.04 Results A qualitative comparison reveals the clear inﬂuence of the temperature T 1 on the velocity pro- ﬁle. In the case of negligible viscous and heat-conductive effects (left column, rh = 10 m), the maximum velocity amplitude at x = L signiﬁcantly increases from |U 1/A| ≈ 4.05 m s at tempera- ture T 1 = 300 K to |U 1/A| ≈ 7 m s at temperature T 1 = 1100 K (moving down in Fig. 2.05). Turning to smaller channel widths rh (moving right in Fig. 2.05), two temperature-dependent effects re- veal: (i) A change in velocity amplitude: for low temperatures T 1, the (low) amplitude increases, whereas for large temperatures T 1, the (large) amplitude decreases. (ii) A shift of the location of maximum velocity: for low temperatures T 1, the location of maximum velocity moves to larger positions x (beyond the channel length L). For large temperatures T 1, the maximum velocity moves to smaller positions x, yielding the maximum velocity within the channel at 0 < x < L. Temperature T 1 and channel width rh also impact the curvature of the pressure proﬁle ⏐⏐p 1 ⏐⏐. However, for a qualitative evaluation, the differences are far less signiﬁcant and not further outlined at this point. Figure 2.06 shows the corresponding phase proﬁles of the pressure p 1 ( ) and velocity U 1/A ( ). Again, the initial condition is fulﬁlled for each instance: ̸ p′|x=0, t=0 = ̸ p 1|x=0 ≡ 0. Next, for the inviscid and non-heat-conducting limit (left column, rh = 10 m), the temperature distri- bution does neither affect the pressure nor the velocity phase: Both phases are constant along the x-axis, with the pressure leading the velocity by an angle of∆φ = π/2. Turning to smaller chan- nel widths rh (moving right in Fig. 2.06), two effects are revealed: (i) A temperature-independent decrease of the phase difference ∆φ: starting at ∆φ = π/2, the phase difference decreases to ∆φ = 0 when the real-part of the eigenfrequency vanishes (moving right in Fig. 2.06). Compar- ison to Fig. 2.02 reveals that the three rows for T 1 = 200 K, 500 K, and 900 K perfectly capture this threshold of vanishing oscillation. (ii) A temperature-dependent curvature and incline of each phase proﬁle: the curvature/incline initially increases before it decreases and vanishes as ∆φ approaches zero. The characteristic of the curvature (left/right, incline/decline) depends on the temperature distribution. The homogeneous temperature proﬁle at T 1 = 300 K yields the threshold with no curvature at constant phases. This discussion only provides pressure and velocity proﬁles for the ﬁrst eigenfrequencyω0. This particular eigenfrequency is consciously chosen for its primary relevance regarding the design of quarter-wave resonators. The evaluation of proﬁles with higher eigenfrequencies exhibits similar characteristics (see Sec. 2.07). The inviscid and non-heat-conducting limiting case of the third eigenfrequency perfectly resembles the absolute pressure and velocity proﬁles displayed in the work by Sujith et al. 2.04.04 Validation The inviscid and non-heat-conducting limit of the present work has been validated against the results obtained by Sujith et al. This includes the analytical validation, the numerical vali- dation of the ﬁrst three eigenfrequenciesω0 (T 1 = 300 K to 1100 K), and the numerical validation of the absolute pressure and velocity proﬁles (T 1 = 500 K and 1100 K). Furthermore, all results displayed in Figs. 2.02 to 2.04 (ﬁrst three eigenfrequencies, various tem- peratures T 1, and channel widths rh) were numerically validated against the underlying mo- mentum and continuity equations (Eqns. (2.020) and (2.022)): The derived equations were used Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation to calculate the pressure and velocity proﬁles ( p′ and U′, respectively) and their derivatives in respect to space and time along the ﬁnely discretized x-axis for various instances of time with t = 2πφ/Re(ω0) with φ = (i/8)π and i = 0 to 7. Inserting these proﬁles into the conservation equations, showed deviations of the order of machine precision and numerous orders of mag- nitude below the actual amplitudes and their derivatives. Thus, the author is conﬁdent that the derived equations satisfy Rott’s differential equations. 2.05 Summary and Conclusions on Duct Acoustics with Vis- cous and Thermal Dissipation This chapter presents two novel approaches for the analytical solution of acoustic equations in channel ﬂows. The underlying framework of Rott’s thermoacoustic approximation accounts for hydrodynamic and thermal losses induced by the boundary layers at the channel walls. In the case of spatially uniform temperature proﬁles, the solution is obtained in terms of char- acteristic waves. Linear temperature proﬁles (at constant viscosity) require a transformation into the temperature space to eliminate unknown coefﬁcients. The general solution is applied to a quarter-wave channel with an open and closed end. For this speciﬁc application, the thesis presents quantitative results for the ﬁrst three complex-valued eigenfrequencies that describe the decaying characteristic of the acoustic oscillation. Selected examples of pressure and velocity amplitudes and phases are presented and discussed. The calculated proﬁles are validated against the underlying conservation equations. Existing literature serves as validation and discussion of the inviscid and non-heat-conducting limit. The present work provides insight into the impact of boundary layers on acoustic eigenfrequen- cies and the consequent temporal decay of amplitudes: Increasing boundary effects (generated by a decreasing channel width) lower the (real part of the) eigenfrequency subject to the de- crease in the phase velocity. Besides, the temporal decay of the amplitudes increases. At a certain threshold, the oscillating characteristic vanishes. The analytical nature of the derivations allows the quick calculation of the velocity and temperature proﬁles. Boundary related effects generate signiﬁcant changes in oscillation amplitudes and phase shifts. To model a process of more technical relevance (i.e. a combustion chamber operating at its design point), the following Chapter 3 describes the adaption of the present framework to the steady state oscillation of an acoustic quarter-wave resonator (i.e. the imaginary part of the angular frequency is zero). Thereby, this thesis presents a novel modeling approach that spatially resolves the resonator tube to predict its acoustic performance. The particular importance and technical relevance of the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer will be highlighted and discussed in more detail. In future research, the present analytical and thus computationally efﬁcient calculation method of velocity and pressure proﬁles may serve to determine the axial heat ﬂux (compare Chapter 4). 2.06 Outlook: Considerations on Exponential Temperature Proﬁles 2.06 Outlook: Considerations on Exponential Temperature Proﬁles This appendix outlines a solution strategy for exponential temperature proﬁles, reading: Tm(x) = T 0 e−kx, (2.083) and thus d Tm dx = −k T 0 e−kx = −k Tm and d 2 Tm dx 2 = k 2 T 0 e−kx = k 2 Tm. (2.084) Using the linear properties from Eqs. (2.083) and (2.084) to simplify the transformed second order differential equation (Eq. (2.066)) yields: T 2 m d 2 p 1 d T 2 m +(2 −d⋆)Tm dp 1 d Tm + b⋆ a⋆ ω2/k 2 γRTm p 1 = 0, (2.085) which, analogous to the set-up with the linear temperature proﬁle, is a Sturm-Liouville equa- tion. The solution of this function is known: p 1 =c 1 b(1−d⋆)/2 ( 1 Tm )(1−d⋆)/2 Γ(d⋆)Jd⋆−1 ( ω aexp √ Tm ) +c 2 b(1−d⋆)/2 ( 1 Tm )(1−d⋆)/2 Γ(2 −d⋆)J 1−d⋆ ( ω aexp √ Tm ), (2.086) where c 1 and c 2 are complex-valued constants, J is the Bessel functions of ﬁrst kind, and Γ the gamma function. The constant aexp is deﬁned as aexp = |k| √ γR c⋆. (2.087) Subsequent derivations applied to linear temperature gradient (the analysis toward the volume ﬂow U 1, the calculation of eigenfrequencies ω, and the ﬁnal determination of the unknown constants c 1 and c 2, see Secs. 2.03.01 and 2.03.02) also hold for the exponential case. However, the corresponding formulas become signiﬁcantly longer and are not further presented in this work. 2.07 Outlook: Pressure and Velocity Proﬁles for Higher Mode Orders For completeness, this appendix presents the additional pressure and velocity proﬁles for the second and third eigenfrequency, respectively.

Duct Acoustics with Viscous and Thermal Dissipation 3 Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator The previous Chapter 2 studied acoustically oscillating channel ﬂows at constant and linear axial mean temperature proﬁles. The described model focused on the eigenfrequencies of a de- caying oscillation in a quarter-wave channel. Building on the previous work, the present chapter introduces an analytical model to predict the acoustic damping characteristics (e.g. the acous- tic impedance) of quarter-wave resonators. The model focuses on the linear damping regime and accounts for viscous and thermal losses formulated in Rott’s thermoacoustic theory. The novelty of the present framework compared to existing models from the literature lies in the spatially resolved evaluation of the acoustic properties along the resonator tube. Consequently, the model does not require a ﬁctive length parameter (i.e. for the modeling of an acoustically compact, oscillating mass). The present approach is valid over an extended range of parameters and accounts for thick hydrodynamic boundary layers. Furthermore, it examines more com- plex conﬁgurations including thermal heat exchange with the surrounding walls. Thereby, the separate treatment of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers allows modeling adiabatic or isothermal resonator walls. Besides determining the overall acoustic characteristics at the resonator mouth, the validated framework calculates the local pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations along the resonator tube. The present work focuses on uniform temperature within the resonator. However, an extension to linear temperature proﬁles (see Sec. 2.03) shall be straight forward. Section 3.01 outlines the fundamental background of acoustic resonators. In the following the reference model for quarter-wave resonators by Laudien et al is presented (Sec. 3.01.01). Section 3.02 develops the novel approach of the present study. Results of the new framework are validated (Sec. 3.03) and discussed via the reﬂection coefﬁcient and the acoustic impedance (Sec. 3.04.02). Section 3.04.03 displays local proﬁles of acoustic velocity, pressure, and character- istic waves along the resonator tube. Section 3.05 concludes the modeling method of a quarter- wave resonator. In rocket engine combustion chambers, strong temperature gradients affect the damping perfor- mance of acoustic quarter-wave resonators. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the damping characteristics is crucial for the safe operation of the engine. Section 5.01 presents a publica- tion and provides an overview of such a predictive numerical framework that quantiﬁes the temperature-dependent performance. 3.01 The Acoustic Resonator Hard walls perfectly reﬂect an incident acoustic wave without losses. Thus, a conﬁning wall structure (e.g. a rocket engine combustion chamber) cannot absorb acoustic energy but only Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator f g f g u 1, p 1 Figure 3.01: Sketch of a Helmholtz resonator (left) and a quarter-wave resonator (right). diverts it. To prevent such potential feedback, acoustic resonators are commonly used to dissi- pate energy at the walls. Consequently, the reﬂected acoustic wave returns less energy than the incident wave. Two widely applied types of resonators are the Helmholtz and the quarter-wave resonator (see Fig. 3.01). The Helmholtz resonator consists of a cavity that connects to the surrounding by an (acoustically compact) neck. In analogy to a mass-spring-damper system, the ﬂuid within the neck corresponds to the mass. The compressible gas in the backing cavity acts as the restoring spring, and viscous dissipation (e.g. friction inside the neck) damps the system. This analogy indicates the eigenfrequency as one important characteristic of acoustic resonators. It depends on geometric properties (e.g. the neck length and the backing volume) and thermophysical properties (e.g. via the speed of sound). The quarter-wave resonator consists of a single tube. At its mouth, one side of the tube con- nects to the wall surface, whereas the other end of the tube is closed. As the name of this resonator suggests, the tube length corresponds to a quarter of the acoustic wavelength of its eigenfrequency. The dissipative properties of acoustic resonators result from two types of losses: First, viscous friction along the walls generates linear losses. Second, for increased oscillation amplitudes, the ﬂuid ﬂow may no longer follow the sharp, edge-shaped contours at the resonator mouth and vortex shedding generates non-linear losses. Förner provides a comprehensive study on the quantiﬁcation of non-linear losses. The present thesis focuses on linear losses at low oscillation amplitudes. The speciﬁc acoustic impedance describes the normalized ratio of the pressure and velocity amplitudes (p 1 and u 1, respectively) at the resonator mouth: zres = 1 ρmc p 1 u 1. (3.01) Note that the velocity u 1 directs in wall-normal direction (compare Fig. 3.01). The reﬂection coefﬁcient Rres relates the reﬂected acoustic g-wave to the incident f -wave: Rres = g f = z −1 z +1. (3.02) Both the acoustic impedance and the reﬂection coefﬁcient contain equivalent information. How- ever, the reﬂection coefﬁcient may appear as the more intuitive parameter: |Rres| =1 indicates 3.01 The Acoustic Resonator L x Tm U′|x=0 = 0 d = 4 rh p′|x=Le = 0 drop: Le δ0 Lr Figure 3.02: Geometry and boundary conditions of a quarter-wave resonator with geometrical length L, end correction δ0, and effective length Le. Laudien et al proposed the ﬁctive neck length Lr as a ﬁtting parameter. a fully reﬂecting boundary without losses, while |Rres| =0 corresponds to a perfectly absorbing interface. In the range 0 < |Rres| <1, a reduced reﬂection occurs. Due to energy conservation, the reﬂection coefﬁcient |Rres| cannot exceed unity for a passively damped system. 3.01.01 Analytical Model by Laudien et al In 1896, Rayleigh modeled the Helmholtz resonator as a mass-spring-damper system. Since then, many authors (see e.g. ) have applied this analogy to describe the behavior of acoustic resonators in a semi-analytical way. This section outlines the work by Laudien et al. who extended the former model to calculate the acoustic impedance of a quarter-wave resonator. Consecutive analytical and numerical studies expanded on temperature inhomogene- ity along the resonator axis. Laudien et al devolved an acoustic model for a quarter-wave resonator. They extended a mass-spring-damper system, initially applied to the acoustically compact Helmholtz res- onator [48–50], to the geometry of a quarter acoustic wavelength. The imaginary part of the speciﬁc impedance, the reactance, reads: Im(zres,Laud) = −cot (ωLe c ), (3.03) and describes the ratio of pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations in the absence of losses. The ef- fective length Le adjusts the geometric tube length L by an end correction δ0, a well-known correlation for a piston radiating into half-space : Le = L +δ0 ≈ L + 4 3πd, (3.04) where d = 4 rh is the tube diameter.1 The real part of the speciﬁc impedance, the resistance, follows from the assumption of equal eigenfrequencies of the quarter-wave tube and the analogy to a Helmholtz resonator modeled 1 This – admittedly contra-intuitive – correlation follows from the deﬁnition of the hydraulic radius (compare Eq. (2.025)). Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator as a mass-spring-damper system: Re(zres,Laud) = 2 ( 1 +ϵnl + Lr d )p 2νω c, (3.05) where ϵnl includes non-linear effects (see e.g. ) and Lr is the ﬁctive neck length used as a ﬁtting parameter (compare Fig. 3.02). Lr d ≈ 0.0405 L d −0.008. (3.06) The model by Laudien et al includes several limitations: It (i) only holds for cylindrical ducts with small boundary layers δν, (ii) thermal exchange with the walls of the tube is not in- corporated, and (iii) the resistance is calculated via a ﬁctive neck-length based on an acoustically compact analogy, tuned to match eigenfrequencies. Thus, there is no continuous spatial evalua- tion over the resonator length. Despite its limitations, the model by Laudien et al serves for validation (Sec. 3.03) and discussion (Sec. 3.04) of the proposed novel model (Sec. 3.02). 3.02 Novel and Spatially Resolved Model The previous Chapter 2 suggests a framework to calculate the eigenfrequencies of a quarter- wave channel depicted in Fig. 3.02: The resonator of effective length Le (geometric length L = Le − δ0) and diameter d = 4 rh (the hydraulic radius of a tube is half the actual radius) is closed at x = 0 (implying U 1|x=0 = 0) and open at x = Le (implying p 1|x=Le = 0). Results show an exponential decay of acoustic amplitudes in time. However, this set-up is of little prac- tical relevance. In technical applications operating at (time-averaged) steady state, resonators dissipate acoustic energy at constant (periodic) amplitudes. Obviously, the boundary conditions outlined above cannot hold: The presence of a pressure node at the resonator mouth contradicts a continuous ﬂow rate of energy (which corresponds to the product of velocity and pressure). Thus, this assumption is dropped in the present study to allow operating conditions such that energy is conserved: The dissipated energy by the resonator equals the ﬂow rate from the out- side. The present thesis proposes a novel method to calculate the speciﬁc acoustic impedance zres based on this idea. The following considerations are applied to the previous derivations with homogeneous mean temperature d Tm/dx = 0 (compare Sec. 2.02). However, an extension to linear mean temperature (Sec. 2.03) should be straight forward. The boundary condition U′|x=0 = 0 at the closed end of the resonator x = 0 (compare e.g. Eq. 2.052) directly yields the ratio of the characteristic amplitudes ˆF and ˆG: ˆF = ˆG. (3.07) Inserting the pressure p 1 (Eq. (2.046)) and velocity u 1 (Eq. (2.047)) into the speciﬁc impedance zres (Eq. (3.01)) yields at the resonator mouth x = Le: zres = e−ik x Le +eik x Le − p a⋆b⋆ ( e−ik x Le −eik x Le ). (3.08) 3.03 Validation Note that the direction of velocity u 1 within the resonator (according to Eq. (2.047)) opposes the wall-normal direction pointing into the resonator (compare Fig. 3.02). Therefore, the velocityu 1 is considered with the opposite sign in Eq. (3.01). Considering the cross-sectional area jump between the resonator and the surrounding environ- ment terminated by a hard wall ( Rwall = 1, area ratio β = (Awall + Ares)/Ares, and Ares = 4πrh) yields the overall reﬂection coefﬁcient R : R = βzres −1 βzres +1. (3.09) This transformation incorporates the corresponding velocity jump across the area change. The incident acoustic wave (index +) reaches the wall-resonator interface at x = L+ e with the amplitude ˆG+. The previous characteristic derivations for the pressure p′ (Eq. (2.046)), velocity u′ (Eq. (2.047)), and wavenumber kx (Eq. (2.044)) are also valid outside of the resonator tube and signiﬁcantly simplify within this inviscid and non-heat-conductive environment: a⋆ = b⋆ = 1. It directly follows that at x = Le: ˆF+ = R ˆG+ (3.010) and p′ ρc ⏐⏐⏐⏐ x=Le = (1 +R) ˆG+ 2. (3.011) Note: For the modeling of the end correction δ0, an equivalent (slightly longer) resonator of length Le – that does not require an end correction – is considered. Thus, the front wall (resonator-to-environment interface) lies at position x = Le. The end correction is required to include multi-dimensional effects at the resonator mouth, whereas the underlying framework of an (zero-dimensional) area jump neglects these effects. The acoustic pressure p′ does not change across the area jump at the resonator mouth. Thus, the speciﬁc values for ˆF = ˆG follow from the pressure coupling condition at the mouth of the resonator (x = Le): ˆF = ˆG = (1 +R) ˆG+ exp ( −iω √ b⋆ a⋆ L c ) +exp ( iω √ b⋆ a⋆ L c ). (3.012) The two loss mechanisms of the present model are attributed to hydrodynamic and thermal wall interaction along the complete resonator axis: (i) within the hydrodynamic boundary layer, en- ergy is reduced via viscous dissipation, and (ii) within the thermal boundary layer, energy is reduced via a heat ﬂux between the ﬂuid and wall. The model does not account for non-linear losses (i.e. generated by vortex shedding at the edges of the resonator mouth). The incorpora- tion of such effects (e.g. via the coefﬁcientϵnl, compare Eq. (3.05)) would require modiﬁcations of the “jump condition” at the discrete location of the resonator mouth (x = Le) and is not further examined in the present thesis. 3.03 Validation In this section, the present model is validated against the analytical framework by Laudien et al. (which is validated against experimental results) and against numerical results by van Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator Figure 3.03: Validation of the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R vs. the frequency f.

The validation is restricted to thin hydrodynamic boundary layers compared to the tube diameter: δν ≪ d, a restriction that applies to the model by Laudien et al. Nevertheless, the underlying frame- work of characteristic acoustic waves with losses (Sec. 3.01) is validated against the conservation equations of Rott’s thermoacoustic theorem (see Sec. 2.04.04). The validation set-up corresponds to the study by van Buren et al (see Sec. 5.01, reproduced in the Appendix on p. 113 ff.) at the spatially constant temperature Tm = 647 K. Figure 3.03 de- picts the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R vs. the frequency f. Applying the end correc- tion to the present model ( ), the results show very good agreement with existing analytical results (, Laudien et al ) and good agreement with numerical results (, van Buren et al. ). The dotted red line ( ) illustrates the inﬂuence of the small ﬂuid portion in front of the resonator mouth: not accounting for the end correction leads to a shift in eigenfrequency. Note that the end correction has a predominant effect at large tube diametersd compared to the geometric length L. For the latter results where d ≪ L, this effect is (close to) negligible. Also, note the inﬂuence of ﬂuid-wall heat exchange ( ) that signiﬁcantly affects the reﬂection amplitude. Laudien et al and van Buren et al assume adiabatic walls, which implies δκ → 0 (fκ → 0 and a⋆ → 1). The present model allows to drop this restriction and, thus to consider thermal boundary layer effects. 3.04 Results 3.04 Results 3.04.01 Parametric Set-Up The effective resonator length is Le = 4 m at a mean temperature of Tm = 300 K. The mean pressure along the resonator is pm = 101325 Pa. Following the study of the previous Chapter 2, air-speciﬁc values for the heat capacity ratio γ = 1.04 and the gas constant R = 287.05 m 2 s 2 K are selected. Evaluating the effect of viscous and thermal boundary layers, this work investigates acoustics in a circular tube geometry with a hydraulic radiusrh. The hydraulic radius rh controls the impact that the boundary layers exerts on the ﬂuid, whereas the kinematic viscosityν = 1.0516×10−5 m 2 s and the Prandtl number Pr = ν/κ = 0.0711 are constant. The initial condition of the incident acoustic wave is ˆG+ = 1 m s. The present study covers three different area jumps to the environ- ment with β = 1, 10, and 100. The limit of β = 1 describes a transition from the tube (wall- effects) to the surrounding region (no wall-effects) without an area jump (e.g, a thermoacoustic stack). For the application of resonator rings in combustion chambers, β = 10 is selected. Fi- nally, β = 100 characterizes a large area jump as it may be found in acoustic liners and as it was applied in numerical studies by van Buren et al (see Validation in Sec. 3.03). 3.04.02 Evaluation of Reﬂection Coefﬁcient and Impedance First, results that include hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers are presented. Figure 3.04 shows the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R (ﬁrst row), resistance Re (z) (second row), and reactance Im (z) (third row) vs. the angular frequency ω and the hydraulic radius rh. From left to right, three different area ratios β = 1, 10, and 100 are selected. Minimum reﬂection occurs when the speciﬁc resistance Re (z) = 1 and the speciﬁc reactance Im (z) = 0 ( in the corresponding plots). The optimal resistance shifts to larger radii rh with an increasing area ra- tio β. Furthermore, the gradient in reactance increases. Overall, these two dominant changes in resistance and reactance impact the reﬂection coefﬁcient as follows: (i) a shift of minimum re- ﬂection towards larger radii rh (i.e. due to the reduced impact of viscosity) while the frequency ω is almost unaffected and (ii) a narrowing bandwidth in frequency ω while the bandwidth in the hydraulic radius rh is almost unaffected. The blue dots ( ) indicate the parametric set-ups of the latter discussion of the acoustic proﬁles (see Sec. 3.04.03). Furthermore, the central blue dot ( ) indicates the parametric set-up of minimum reﬂection in each plot (also compare Table 3.01). Second, Figure 3.05 excludes the effects of thermal boundary layers, making the results more comparable to the model by Laudien et al. The speciﬁc reactance is almost unaffected by the lack of thermal exchange. However, the resistance changes, particularly at low frequencies ω and large area ratios β. Consequently, the parametric set-up of minimum reﬂection shifts to smaller hydraulic radii rh for β = 10 and 100. This observation agrees well with the validation section, where the thermal boundary layers affects the amplitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R, but not the frequency ω.

Laudien et al. Clear deviations exist at low radiirh, which result from the assumption of thin hydrodynamic boundary layers ( δν ≪ rh) implied by Laudien et al: Close to eigenfrequency ω0 = 136.046 1 s, the hydrodynamic boundary layer is δν ≈ 0.0015 m. In the vicinity of minimum reﬂection, this obviously contradicts the assumption of relatively small boundary layers for the two instances with area ratios of β = 1 and β = 10 where the tube diameter is d ≈ 0.00006 m and d ≈ 0.0006 m, respectively. Only results for β = 100 with d ≈ 0.006 m approach the assumption. Thus only for β = 100 the model by Laudien and coworkers yields potentially accurate results. Table 3.01 summarizes the parametric set-up of minimum acoustic reﬂection for the three models presented above. 3.04.03 Evaluation of Spatial Pressure and Velocity Proﬁles The present section focuses on the novel model with viscous and thermal losses (i.e. compare to the results of Fig. 3.04). Figures 3.07 to 3.014 show spatially resolved proﬁles for the pressure p 1 and velocity U 1/A and for the characteristic acoustic f and g-waves. Each complex-valued proﬁle is presented via its magnitude and phase. Figures 3.07 to 3.010 correspond to the geometry without an area jump (i.e. β = 1) and Figs. 3.011 to 3.014 to β = 10. The central plot of each ﬁgure presents the parametric set-up of minimum acoustic reﬂection (i.e. |R| ≈0). To the left and right, the hydraulic channel width rh varies by the factors 10−0.03 and 100.03, respectively. To the top and bottom, the angular frequency varies by ±50 1 s (β = 1) and ±20 1 s (β = 10). The blue dots ( ) in Fig. 3.04 mark the nine selected parametric set-ups from Fig. 3.07 through 3.014. The physical quantities of pressurep 1 and velocity U 1/A (β = 1, magnitude: Fig. 3.07 and phase: Fig 3.08) show a few characteristics worth mentioning: First, note that the pressure ( ) and the velocity ( ) are contentiously resolved in space. Neither the magnitude nor the phase shows discontinuities, particularly not at the front interface at x = 4 m. Second, the acoustic velocity diminishes at the backing wall of the resonator (x = 0 m). In front of the resonator ( x > 4 m) and for the non-reﬂecting interface ( |R| =0, central plot in Fig. 3.07), the magnitude of the normalized pressure and velocity is spatially constant and equals |p 1|/(ρc) = |U 1|/A = ˆG+/2 = 0.05 m s (there is no reﬂected f -wave). This corresponds to a purely traveling acoustic g-wave. For the remaining instances with 0 < |R| <1, pressure and velocity show wavy characteristics without pressure and velocity nodes. The reﬂectedf -wave is of lower magnitude than the incident g-wave. The product of pressure p 1 and velocity u 1 scales with the rate of dissipated energy within the resonator and is larger than zero at the resonator mouth.

Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator Turning to the phase diagrams (Fig. 3.08), the central case on a non-reﬂecting boundary yields a constant spatial change in the phase of pressure p 1 and velocity u 1 in front of the resonator. Again, this indicates a purely traveling acoustic wave, where pressure and velocity maxima travel with the speed of sound c. Figures 3.09 and 3.010 show the corresponding characteristicf and g-waves. The incidentg-wave ( ) travels from right-to-left and the reﬂected f -wave ( ) from left-to-right. Outside of the resonator (x > 4 m), the ﬂow is isentropic. Thus the magnitude of the two characteristic waves is spatially constant. Its ratio yields the reﬂection the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R. Inside the resonator tube ( x < 4 m), the viscous and thermal dissipation yields an exponential spatial decay in magnitude. Moving to the left plots of Fig. 3.09, smaller hydraulic radiiri induce higher losses and thus a stronger decay. At the hard backing wall of the resonator (x < 0 m) with Rwall = 1, a continuous transition from g to f -wave shows. Within each domain (resonator tube and isentropic environment) the characteristic waves travel with constant speed (compare constant slopes in Fig. 3.010). They correspond to the phase speed and the speed of sound, respectively. For narrow resonator tubes with small hydraulic radii rh, note the more signiﬁcant change towards a steeper slope, indicating a more decreased phase velocity. Figures 3.011 to 3.014 extend to the area jump corresponding to β = 10. Most discussions agree with those of the previews set-up (β = 1). Thus, this section highlights the relevant differences. Inside the resonator, the area jump β = 10 leads to a strong increase of the magnitude in pres- sure |p 1| and velocity |U 1|/A (Fig. 3.011, note the normalization by the area ratio β = 10 inside the resonator). This increases the dissipation rate and balances the increased incident acoustic energy due to the increased area of the environment. The area jump leads to a discontinuity in the magnitude of the velocity proﬁle. The magnitude of the pressure, as well as the phase of pressure and velocity (Fig. 3.012), show continuous transitions over the resonator-environment interface. At the area ratio β = 10, the magnitude of the characteristic f and g-waves (Fig. 3.013) clearly deviates from the results obtained at β = 1: Figure 3.04 reveals that the area jump signiﬁcantly increases the optimum hydraulic radii hr for minimum acoustic reﬂection. Thus, the spatial decay of the in-traveling g-wave to the out-traveling f -wave clearly decreases. The characteris- tics within the resonator tube approach those of a standing acoustic wave. This conclusion also shows in Fig. 3.011, where the pressure amplitude p 1 converges to a pressure node. The slopes in the characteristic phase (Fig. 3.014) reveal the (close to) accordance between phase velocity and the speed of sound. The ﬁnding of overall (close to) standing wave characteristics generates important insight for future work. E.g. the derivation of longitudinal heat transfer within the resonator may build on the underlying pressure and velocity oscillations of a standing wave. 3.04 Results Figure 3.011: Magnitude of normalized pressure ⏐⏐p 1 ⏐⏐/(ρc) ( and ) and velocity |U 1|/A ( ) for β = 10.

The study accounts for viscous and thermal losses formulated in Rott’s thermoacoustic theory. Un- like existing models from the literature, the present framework continuously evaluates the spa- tial acoustic properties along the resonator tube. The separate treatment of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers allows modeling adiabatic as well as isothermal resonator walls. The present model is validated against the analytical model by Laudien et al and numerical results by van Buren et al. Thereby, the signiﬁcant impact of wall-to-ﬂuid heat transfer is revealed. Furthermore, the importance of an end correction shows. The study reports overall acoustic characteristics of the resonator (acoustic impedance z and reﬂection coefﬁcient R) over a wide parametric range. Local pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations are carefully discussed. The presentation as characteristic waves reveals an important insight for future studies: At larger area jumps (e.g.β ≥ 10, typical in many technical applications), the dissipation within the resonator is primarily generated by high oscillation amplitudes rather than a strong spatial decay. Thus, consecutive studies may also use inviscid approaches to estimate the acoustic proﬁles of a standing wave. The present model considers spatially constant temperature proﬁles within the resonator. Based on previous derivations in Sec. 2.03, future work may extend the framework to linear temperature proﬁles. Such temperature inhomogeneities are of particular interest in rocket engine combus- tion chambers, where extreme temperature gradients exist between the hot combustion products and the regeneratively cooled chamber walls. Section 5.01 presents the numerical framework of a publication that quantiﬁes the inﬂuence of the local temperature distribution on the acoustic damping performance of a quarter-wave resonator. Modeling of an Acoustic Quarter-Wave Resonator 4 Heat Transfer in Resonators The present chapter focuses on longitudinal heat transfer inside a quarter-wave resonator. A comprehensive understanding of the thermal mechanisms in oscillating ﬂows is of particular relevance for the derivation of accurate temperature distributions required for the subsequent calculation of the acoustic performance (compare Chapter 3). The ﬁrst part of the present chapter compares analytical work by Kurzweg with the ther- moacoustic theory by Rott. Kurzweg studied longitudinal heat transfer in incompressible oscillating channel ﬂows between parallel plates via the effective longitudinal thermal diffu- sivity (Sec. 4.01.01). Subsequent simpliﬁcations are proposed in Sec. 4.01.02. Rott quantiﬁed the so-called total power as an important measure for thermoacoustics (Sec. 4.01.03). This power is not acoustic power, not heat and not mechanical power, but a more subtle quantity: Imagine a control volume around an adiabatic stack. In a steady state and time-averaged over an inte- gral number of acoustic cycles, the energy inside the system needs to be preserved. Thus the rate of total power inﬂow must be equal to the outﬂow rate. In direct comparison, the formula- tion by Kurzweg beneﬁts from a more general wall-temperature setting that evaluates conjugate heat transfer in the ﬂuid and the wall. On the other hand, Rott’s theory considers pressure ﬂuc- tuations. The comparison of the two approaches gives insight into the individual strengths of each approach. In particular, the respective ﬁeld of application (incompressible/compressible, transient wall temperatures, etc.) becomes apparent. In Sec. 4.02, the present thesis shows that both studies (Kurzweg and Rott, respectively) analyt- ically yield the same results for the total power ﬂow rate within a shared range of applicability (location of a pressure node and a temporally constant wall temperature). A numerical exam- ination over a wide range of parameters reveals that both velocity- or pressure-related energy transfer may dominate in a standing wave (e.g. in a quarter-wave resonator, Sec. 4.03). Section 5.02 presents a publication and concludes with a theoretical investigation of the prevailing heat transfer mechanisms that deﬁne the problem at hand. The interplay of the hy- drodynamic and thermal boundary layers is analyzed in more detail in this context. 4.01 Summary of the Analytical Approaches The ﬁrst part of the present chapter provides an overview of Kurzweg’s work (Sec. 4.01.01) and proposes simpliﬁcations (Sec. 4.01.02). An introduction of Rott’s total power follows in Sec. 4.01.03.

His motivation derived from numerous studies that reported enhanced axial dis- persion of passive scalars – such as contaminations – induced by oscillations [54–57]. The- oretical and experimental studies support Kurzweg’s work. In subsequent studies, researchers elaborated on analyzing the so-calleddream pipe, a bundle of capillary heat transfer tubes [60–63]. The technical relevance for the industrial ﬁeld is shown, e.g. by the topical work of Bothien and Wassmer (inﬂuence of the temperature on the damping characteristics of a Helmholtz resonator) or ´Cosi´c et al (concentration gradients in resonator tubes). For the analytical derivation of the effective thermal diffusivity κe, Kurzweg considered oscil- lating channel ﬂow under the following assumption : • the oscillating channel ﬂow is laminar and incompressible, • the set-up is two-dimensional, • the heat transfer in the wall and channel ﬂow is coupled (conjugate heat transfer), • the velocity oscillation follows the exact solution of the “Stokes problem”, • the heat transfer mechanisms are heat conduction (axial and radial) in the wall, and • heat conduction (axial and radial) as well as convective (axial) heat transfer in the ﬂuid. Figure 4.01 depicts the set-up under investigation: Two parallel solid walls conﬁne a ﬂuid channel of width 2 rh in the z-direction. The non-dimensional position normal to the wall readsη = z/rh with the symmetry-line of the channel located at z = η = 0. Both walls are of thickness 2 b and periodically adjoin neighboring ﬂuid channels, yielding the indicated symmetry condition. The wall-to-channel ratio ϵ is an important geometrical parameter of the conﬁguration: ϵ ≡ b +rh rh. (4.01) 4.01 Summary of the Analytical Approaches Assuming harmonically oscillating laminar ﬂow driven by thenon-dimensional pressure gradi- ent λ ≡ ⏐⏐∂p/∂x ⏐⏐r 2 h ρu 0ν, (4.02) the axial velocity u is given by the real part of the harmonic oscillation u(η, t) = u 0 f (η)eiωt = u 0 iλ α2 [ 1 − cosh( p iαη) cosh( p iα) ] eiωt, (4.03) where u 0 is a representative velocity and α the Womersley number: α ≡ rh √ω ν. (4.04) For further non-dimensional interpretation, the tidal displacement averaged over the channel width reads : ∆x = 2 u 0λ ωα2 ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐1 − tanh( p iα)p iα ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐. (4.05) To determine the local, time-dependent temperature T (x,η, t), differential equations for the solid and the ﬂuid domain are formulated. Within the solid wall, heat conduction is the only transfer mechanism, whereas the ﬂuid domain also accounts for convective transport induced by the oscillating ﬂow. The ratio of the respective thermal conductivities kf in the ﬂuid and ks in the solid is denoted by µ ≡ kf ks. (4.06) Having found closed expressions for velocity u(η, t) and temperature T (x,η, t), the effective thermal diffusivity κe is formulated as the convective transport integrated across the channel width over one oscillation period: κeγT = ω 2π ∫ 2π/ω ∫ 1 Re [ T (x,η, t) ] Re [ u 0 f (η)eiωt ] dη dt, (4.07) where γT is the constant temperature gradient. In non-dimensional presentation, Kurzweg formulates the solution of Eq. (4.07) as κe ω∆x 2 = Pr [ (1 −H) ¯h +(1 − ¯H)h ] +( ¯h − ¯j ¯H) +(h − j H) 16α2(Pr 2 −1) ⏐⏐⏐1 − tanh( p iα)p iα ⏐⏐⏐ 2, (4.08) where h(α) = p iαtanh( p iα), (4.09) j(Pr,α) = p i Prαtanh( p i Prα), (4.010) and H(Pr,µ,σ,α,ϵ) = 1 Pr µ p Prtanh( p iα) +pσtanh( p iσPrα(ϵ−1)) µtanh( p i Prα) +pσtanh( p iσPrα(ϵ−1)), (4.011) Heat Transfer in Resonators where σ ≡ κf κs (4.012) is the ratio of the thermal diffusivities κ in the ﬂuid and the wall, respectively. The bar-operator ¯· denotes the complex conjugate of the functions h, j, and H. Kurzweg’s ﬁnal correlation reveals that the non-dimensional presentation in Eq. (4.08) is solely a function of material properties (Pr, µ, and σ), geometry (ϵ), and Womersley number α. 4.01.02 Simpliﬁcation to the Derivation of Kurzweg To facilitate the comparison of Kurzweg’s results with Rott’s acoustic theory, the wall- temperature is adjusted. Instead of a coupled system where conjugate heat transfer leads to temporal temperature oscillations within the wall, van Buren and Polifke (see Sec. 5.03.02, reproduced in the Appendix on p. 155 ff.) suggested the following assumption for temporally constant, but spatially linear wall temperatures (temperature gradient γT = d T /dx). They stud- ied a set-up characterized by a solid of high speciﬁc heat capacity cp, density ρ, and thermal conductivity k compared to the ﬂuid. In particular, this holds for metallic walls, conﬁning a channel ﬁlled with air and allows the following assumptions: kf ≪ ks → µ ≈ 0 (4.013) and ρf cf ≪ ρscs. (4.014) For the ratio of thermal diffusivities σ, no deﬁnite limit exists due to the opposing effects of thermal conductivity and heat capacity. Regarding the geometry, a small channel widthrh much smaller than the wall thicknessb yields: rh ≪ b → ϵ ≈ ∞. (4.015) This set-up is typical for quarter-wave resonators in rocket engine combustion chambers. The physical interpretation of the proposed assumptions yields a Dirichlet boundary condition at the ﬂuid-solid interface ( z = rh). A simpliﬁed version (denoted by the star ⋆) of Kurzweg’s solution (4.08) reads : κ⋆ e ω∆x 2 = Pr Re(h) − 1 Pr Re(j) 8α2(Pr 2 −1) ⏐⏐⏐1 − tanh( p iα)p iα ⏐⏐⏐ 2. (4.016) This derivation exploits that H⋆ = 1/Pr is purely real-valued. Consequently, the expansion of the complex conjugate terms in the numerator of Eq. (4.08) simpliﬁes such that all imaginary- valued parts cancel out. 4.02 Analytical Transformation: Kurzweg vs. Rott 4.01.03 Total Energy Flux by Rott The assumptions of Rott’s fundamental thermoacoustic theory, the underlying conservation equations for mass and momentum conservation, and the resulting differential equations for the pressure p 1 and volume ﬂow rate U 1 were previously presented in Sec. 2.01.03. Based on this framework, Rott deﬁnes the total power ﬂux ˙H by the local energy ﬂux density (whose divergence would cause a transient change in energy per unit volume). It combines convective transfer of speciﬁc enthalpy and kinetic energy, heat conduction, and effects attributed to vis- cous stress. Rott approximates the total power ﬂux ˙H 2 in the x-direction as the time average over the cross-sectional area of the channel. The ﬁnal formula for the total power ˙H 2 reads: ˙H 2 =1 2 Re [ p 1 ¯U 1 ( 1 − fκ − ¯fν (1 +Pr) ( 1 − ¯fν ) )] + ρmcp |U 1|2 2 Aω ( 1 −Pr 2)⏐⏐1 − fν ⏐⏐2 Im ( fκ +Pr ¯fν )d Tm dx − ( Af kf + Asks )d Tm dx, (4.017) where the subscript 2 denotes that the term is of second-order. The expression consists of three terms: the ﬁrst describes an interplay of pressure and velocity oscillations, the second term solely considers convective heat transfer via the velocity oscillations, and the third term accounts for the underlying thermal diffusivity of the ﬂuid and the solid. The following Sec. 4.02 focuses on the second term and compare the convective transport to the formulation by Kurzweg. Sec- tion 4.03 also discusses the inﬂuence of the two remaining ﬁrst and third terms in more detail. 4.02 Analytical Transformation: Kurzweg vs. Rott This section shows that the formulations of Kurzweg and Rott are identical at positions where the assumptions of both derivations match. This position presents the pressure node of a stand- ing wave, as Kurzweg does not account for any effects of compressibility. In this case, the ﬁrst term of Eq. (4.017) in Rott’s correlation equals zero. Furthermore, the formulation for the ef- fective thermal diffusivity κe by Kurzweg does not include longitudinal heat transfer by pure heat conduction, but only convective transport (compare Eq. (4.07)). Thus, also the third term of Eq. (4.017) should be ignored. According to Fourier’s law, the heat ﬂux ˙H 2 should be propor- tional to the cross-sectional area Af and to the negative temperature gradient d Tm/dx: ˙H 2 = −k+ e Af d Tm dx = −κ+ e ρmcp Af d Tm dx, (4.018) Heat Transfer in Resonators where k+ e denotes the effective longitudinal thermal conductivity (derived from the set of equa- tions by Rott). Combining Eq. (4.018) and the second term of Eq. (4.017) yields: κ+ e = − ˙H 2 ρmcp Af d Tm dx = − |U 1|2 2 A 2 f ω ( 1 −Pr 2)⏐⏐1 − fν ⏐⏐2 Im ( fκ +Pr ¯fν ). (4.019) The tidal displacement ∆x results directly from the volume ﬂow rate U 1 of a harmonic oscilla- tion over a half period Tp/2: ∆x = ∫ Tp /2 Re(U 1 eiωt ) Af dt = 1 Af ∫ Tp /2 |U 1|sin(ωt)dt = 2|U 1| Af ω. (4.020) Introducing Kurzweg’s non-dimensional notation for the effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e /(∆x 2ω), Eq. (4.019) converts to: κ+ e ∆x 2ω = − Im ( fκ +Pr ¯fν ) ( 1 −Pr 2)⏐⏐1 − fν ⏐⏐2. (4.021) The parameter fν and fκ are reformulated to express their dependence on the Womersley and Prandtl numbers ( α and Pr, respectively). Recall the boundary layer thicknesses δν and δκ (Eqs. (2.026 and (2.027), respectively), the deﬁnition of the Womersley numberα = rh p ω/ν, and the Prandtl number Pr = ν/κf to express rh/δν and rh/δκ: rh δν = αp (4.022) and rh δκ = α p Prp. (4.023) Substituting these ratios in the expressions for fν and fκ (Eq. (2.023)) allows the expression of Rott’s parameters fν and fκ in terms of the functions h(α) and j(Pr,α) introduced by Kurzweg (Eqs. (4.09) and (4.010)): fν = tanh [ (1 +i) αp ] (1 +i) αp = tanh( p iα)p iα = −ih (α) α2 (4.024) and fκ = tanh [ (1 +i)α p Prp ] (1 +i)α p Prp = tanh( p i Prα)p i Prα = −i j(Pr,α) Prα2. (4.025) 4.03 Discussion of the Formulations by Kurzweg and Rott Next, the simpliﬁed version of Kurzweg’s results is considered (including temporally constant wall temperature, Eq. (4.016)). Using Eq. (4.024), the expression reads (after some rearrange- ments): κ⋆ e ω∆x 2 = − − 1 α2 Pr Re(j) + Pr α2 Re(h) 8(1 −Pr 2) ⏐⏐1 − fν ⏐⏐2. (4.026) Finally, the real parts of the functions h(α) and j(Pr,α) are rewritten: Pr α2 Re(h) = Pr Re(i fν) = Pr Im(−fν) = Pr Im( ¯fν) (4.027) and 1 α2 Pr Re(j) = Re(i fκ) = Im(−fκ) = −Im(fκ). (4.028) Inserting Eqs. (4.027) and (4.028) into Eq. (4.026) gives: κ⋆ e ω∆x 2 = − Im(fκ +Pr ¯fν) 8(1 −Pr 2) ⏐⏐1 − fν ⏐⏐2. (4.029) Both starting points, Rott and Kurzweg, respectively, result in identical expressions for the non- dimensional effective thermal diffusivity κe/(∆x 2ω) (Eq. (4.021) and Eq. (4.029), respectively) for conditions where both approaches are applicable. A side note on the pressure gradient by Kurzweg: Kurzweg introduces the amplitude of the oscillation via the non-dimensional pressure gradient λ (independent of any acoustic con- siderations): λ = ⏐⏐⏐⏐ ∂p ∂x ⏐⏐⏐⏐ r 2 h ρu 0ν. (4.030) In the acoustic framework and at the location of a pressure node without hydrodynamic or thermal losses ( p = ρcu 0), the spatial pressure gradient ∂p/∂x is proportional to the velocity amplitude u 0: ∂p ∂x = pω c = ρωu 0. (4.031) Thus, if the pressure gradient results from a standing acoustic wave, the non-dimensional pres- sure gradient λ equals the square of the Womersley number: λ = ωr 2 h ν = α2. (4.032) 4.03 Discussion of the Formulations by Kurzweg and Rott This section ﬁrst provides a quick summary of the effective normalized thermal diffusivity κe/(ω∆x) used by Kurzweg (see Fig. 4.02). Van Buren and Polifke give a comprehensive discus- sion of this three-dimensional plot (see Sec. 5.02, reproduced in the Appendix on p. 121 ff.).

Figure 4.03: Effective (absolute) thermal diffusivity vs. Womersley and Prandtl numbers. The main advantage of the non-dimensional representation is its independence of the tidal dis- placement/velocity and amplitude/forcing pressure gradient. To clarify this idea, Fig. 4.03 shows the non-normalized effective thermal diffusivityκe. The difference between low and high Wom- ersley numbers α becomes apparent at ﬁrst sight, where correspondingly low or high thermal diffusivity shows. The reason for this is the applied forcing. Kurzweg deﬁnes the oscillating velocity proﬁle via the representative velocity u 0 and/or by the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x, which causes the tidal displacement ∆x. For large Womersley numbers α, hydrodynamic boundary layers are thin. Consequently, the maximum velocity ofu 0 is reached in most parts of the cross- sectional area of the channel. On the other limit, low Womersley numbersα characterize a ﬂow dominated by viscous friction. In this limit, the velocity remains well below the representative velocity u 0. Figure 4.07 illustrates this behavior directly by the tidal displacement ∆x (see the location of a pressure node in a quarter-wave resonator at x = L). This conclusion explains the opposite slopes for high/low Womersley numbers α in the respective normalized and absolute representation of the effective thermal diffusivity κe (Figs. 4.02 and 4.03). As derived in the previous analytical transformation (Sec. 4.02), perfectly identical plots show for the formulation by Rott at the location of a pressure node. What happens when moving away from the pressure node to an arbitrary position of a (standing wave) in a quarter-wave resonator? Obviously, this is the more exciting set-up, as also the ﬁrst (pressure and velocity related) term of Rott’s formulation (Eq. (4.017)) becomes non-zero. Here, the following problem appears: For hydraulic and thermal lossless acoustic waves, the Riemann invariant f and g hold. Thereby, the velocity and pressure proﬁles of a standing wave are quickly determined. However, this acoustic wave (in conformity with its isentropic deﬁnition) would not interact with the boundary walls in any way. Accordingly no oscillation-induced thermal net- energy is transferred along the resonator tube (i.e. α → ∞and Pr ≈ 1). Hence, the ﬂow needs to show some boundary layer interaction and thus it deviates from a perfectly standing acoustic wave. This makes the problem at hand signiﬁcantly more complex. Returning to the location of a (perfect) pressure node, Fig. 4.04 exemplarily shows two of the three terms of Rott’s total energy ﬂux (Eq. (4.017), expressed in terms of thermal diffusivity 4.03 Discussion of the Formulations by Kurzweg and Rott 10 -2 10 0 10 2 Pr [-] 10 -2 10 0 10 2 [-] 10 -20 10 -10 10 0 e [m 2/s] 10 2 [-] 10 0 10 -2 10 -20 Pr [-] 10 0 10 -2 10 2 e [m 2/s] 10 -10 10 0 Figure 4.04: Individual components (term 2 ( ) and term 3 ( )) of thermal diffusivity according to Rott at the pressure node (x = L).

Table 4.01 summarizes the chosen parameters of the air-ﬁlled channel ﬂow. The top-leveled plane ( ) gives the pure thermal diffusivity of the underlying ﬂuid (regardless of oscillations, term 3). It decreases with increasing Prandtl numbers Pr (due to lower thermal conductivity). The Womersley numberα does not affect this term. The blue surface ( ) presents the convection related thermal transport (term 2) also described by Kurzweg. Due to the absence of pressure oscillations, the (pressure and velocity related) term 1 of Eq. (4.017) is zero at the depicted location of a pressure node.

Figure 4.05 shows the effect of an increase in the representative velocity amplitudeu 0 from 0.01 m s to 10 m s. The increase in velocity and thus in the tidal displacement clearly enhances the impact of the convective term 1. Thereby, its contribution to the longitudinal heat transfer exceeds the thermal diffusivity in the parameter range α2 Pr ≈ π. An physical explanation of this regime follows in Sec. 5.02 based on a study by van Buren and Polifke (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 121 ff.). In a ﬁnal step, consider moving to a position of a perfect standing wave, where pressure oscil- lations are existent, with velocity amplitudes smaller than at the pressure node. In this exam- ple, the center between the pressure and velocity nodes of an isentropic quarter-wave channel (i.e. x = L/2, compare to Fig. 2.05 is selected for T 1 = 300 K and rh = 10 m. Figure. 4.07 addi- tionally illustrates the tidal displacement ∆x over the Womersley number α along the channel length). Figure 4.06 displays the three terms of Eq. (4.017) at an unchanged representative veloc- ity u 0 = 10 m s : Now, the pressure-related term 1 (, opposite sign to the other two terms) shows. Again, it becomes apparent that this term can also dominate the problem at hand for a certain range of parameters. 5 Contextualization and Discussion of Publications The project that led to the present Ph. D. thesis was funded by the German Research Founda- tion (DFG) in the framework of a Collaborative Research Centres (SFB-TRR 40, 2008-2020). In the respective Final Report, van Buren and Polifke (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 98 ff.) provide an overview of their results. On the whole, ﬁve universities, industrial part- ners, numerous professors, and even more Ph. D. students contributed to the multidisciplinary research program in different research areas on fundamental space-transportation-systems with a close focus on dominating phenomena in the propulsion systems of liquid propellant rocket engines. The ﬁnal report collects the joined results on Structural Cooling (research area of the present author),Aft-Body Flows, Combustion Chamber, Thrust Nozzle, and Thrust-Chamber Assembly. The present chapter discusses and contextualizes the publications connected to the present the- sis. The Numerical Assessment of a Resonator with Temperature Inhomogeneities (Sec. 5.01) is thematically closely related to the analytical modeling of quarter-wave resonators (compare Chapter 3). The Theoretical Considerations on Boundary Layer Interplay (Sec. 5.02) provides further interpretation on longitudinal heat transfer in oscillation channel ﬂows (compare Chap- ter 4). Finally, the selected publications address the effect of turbulence on heat transfer: First, the Enhancement of Wall-Normal Heat Transfer (Sec. 5.03.01) and second, the Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer (Sec. 5.03.02). 5.01 Numerical Assessment of a Resonator with Temperature Inhomogeneities Chapter 3 reviewed an existing and presented a novel analytical approach for the acoustic char- acterization of a quarter-wave resonator. However, they are restricted to constant temperature proﬁles along the resonator tube. Although there are certain methods and ideas to extend the frameworks to temperature inhomogeneities (e.g. the work by Cárdenas Miranda or the derivations of the present thesis (see Sec. 2.03)), the resulting analytical correlations are re- stricted to selected temperature proﬁles (e.g. linear, exponential, polynomial, etc.). They are subject to several modeling assumptions (e.g. compare Sec. 3.01.01). To overcome these restrictions, van Buren and coworkers (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 113 ff.) developed a numerical framework to quantify the acoustic impedance of quarter- wave resonators with arbitrary temperature distributions. They use a compressible CFD simu- lation that is excited via inwards traveling acoustic waves via the Navier-Stokes Characteristic Contextualization and Discussion of Publications Boundary Condition (NSCBC) of either mono-frequent or broadband characteristic. The evaluation of the results excited by a broadband input-signal is realized by System-Identiﬁcation (CFD/SI). The identiﬁcation process utilizes the output-error model and is based on the studies by Förner and Polifke. For the parameter range under investigation, the numerical results of the study by van Buren and coworkers agree well with the analytical predictions by Cárdenas Miranda. The study clearly underlines the crucial impact of the underlining temperature proﬁle on the acoustic damping characteristics (e.g. a shift in eigenfrequency). In a coupled analysis of combustion chamber and resonator elements, Förner et al as well as Chemnitz et al showed a high sensitivity of global stability in regard to the damping characteristics of the resonator. Thus, a shift in the eigenfrequency of the resonator may result in insufﬁcient damping of the acoustically unstable modes. This, in turn, may lead to catastrophic structural failure of the combustion chamber. The previous ﬁndings illustrate the crucial importance of the temperature proﬁle inside the res- onator. However, the precise derivation of such temperate proﬁles requires a further understand- ing of the governing heat transfer mechanisms. Therefore, the focus of the following chapters will turn to two central challenges in this respect: Chapter 4 investigates heat transfer in oscil- lating channel ﬂows. Chapter 5.03 extends to the impact of turbulence. 5.02 Theoretical Considerations on Boundary Layer Inter- play Chapter 4 offered an overview of longitudinal heat transfer in oscillating ﬂows and a comparison of analytical models (Kurzweg vs. Rott ). However, these considerations are – foremost – of mathematical nature and provide only limited insight and explanation of the physical mech- anisms that deﬁne the problem at hand. Besides, particular relevance may be expected from its limiting cases and the interplay of the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. Therefore, van Buren and Polifke (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 121 ff.) provide a more in-depth discussion of the physical mechanisms of longitudinal heat transfer in oscilla- tory channel ﬂows. The focus lies on six limiting regimes that result from the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer characteristics with either parabolic or bulk proﬁles, respectively. The corresponding interplay of the boundary layers qualitatively explains the longitudinal heat transfer. For a non-dimensionalized analysis of the problem at hand, van Buren and Polifke in- troduce the non-dimensional Kurzweg number Ku to characterize the thermal penetration depth. Thereby, the extend of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers are presented as decoupled inﬂuence factors. Maximum effective thermal diffusivity reveals when the thermal penetration reaches the center of the channel, or Ku 2 ≈ π. All previous considerations of the present thesis are limited to laminar ﬂows. However, the ﬂows in rocket engine combustion chambers are highly turbulent. The literature commonly connects turbulent effects with a signiﬁcant increase in heat transfer that may lead to fatal destruction of the structure. Therefore, the following Chapter 5.03 extends to the impact of turbulence in pulsating ﬂows: First, the effect on wall-normal heat transfer is considered and, second, the 5.03 The Effect of Turbulence on Heat Transfer ˙q⊥ ˙q∥ Acoustic Figure 5.01: Sketch of a combustion chamber with wall-normal ( ˙q⊥, see Sec. 5.03.01) and longi- tudinal ( ˙q∥, see Sec. 5.03.02) heat transfer. effect on longitudinal heat transfer. 5.03 The Effect of Turbulence on Heat Transfer Chapter 4 and the previous publication of Sec. 5.02 focused on the oscillation-induced enhance- ment of convective heat transfer in laminar channel ﬂows (e.g. in the tube of a quarter-wave resonator). However, the literature foremost associates a strong heat transfer enhancement of pulsating ﬂows combined with turbulent effects. In extreme cases, the reported enhancement reached levels that compromise the thermal integrity of devices suffering from thermoacoustic instabilities. Numerous rocket engine combustion chambers suffered from this fatal mechanism: Exceeding the designed wall heat ﬂux obviously endangers a secure operation with possibly catastrophic consequences. Therefore, the reliable prediction of heat transfer in turbulent pul- sating ﬂows is crucial for a comprehensive design process of combustion chambers. Although numerous researchers experimentally studied the enhancement of heat transfer (e.g. [4, 14–22]), the results are of a rather qualitative nature. The reported enhancement ranges from only a few percent up to 300% (e.g. [17–20]). Numerical investigations are limited and also contradictory: Wang and Zhang tackled the problem at hand via a RANS simu- lation. However, Scotti and Piomelli found the RANS to be insufﬁcient and conﬁrmed that it requires a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to capture relevant ﬂuid-mechanical effects. To close these gaps, the present chapter considers two different mechanisms of turbulence- induced enhanced heat transfer: Section 5.03.01 numerically studies wall-normal heat transfer. This mechanism mimics the thermal exchange between the cooled chamber walls and the hot combustion gas (compare the heat ﬂux ˙q⊥ in Fig. 5.01). Section 5.03.01 turns to the effect of tur- bulence on the longitudinal heat transfer (the laminar case was discussed in Chapter 4). This modeling corresponds to the prevailing mechanisms inside a resonator tube, subject to a tem- perature gradient between the hot gases at the resonator mouth and the cooled backing of the cavity (compare ˙q∥ in Fig. 5.01). Contextualization and Discussion of Publications 5.03.01 Enhancement of Wall-Normal Heat Transfer To establish a more comprehensive picture of the wall-normal enhancement of heat transfer, van Buren and coworkers (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 140 ff.) performed a parametric LES study. The incompressible simulation within a periodic computational domain mimics the characteristics of a pressure node of a standing acoustic wave. Many researchers report the most signiﬁcant enhancement at this location of maximum velocity ﬂuctuations (e.g. ). A much wider range of oscillation parameters is studied compared to the existing literature. In par- ticular, forcing frequencies correspond to Womersley numbers fromα = 14 to 70, while forcing amplitudes reach values that result in pronounced ﬂow reversal, i.e. reverse ﬂow velocities up to ﬁve times larger than the mean ﬂow velocity. As a ﬁrst result, van Buren et al report strong deviations of instantaneous heat transfer rates from the temporal mean at moderate pulsation amplitudes (i.e. in the range of emerging ﬂow reversal). Particularly at times of ﬂow reversal, an increase in heat transfer up to 60% over the non-pulsatile reference is observed. However, when averaging over a complete cycle, the overall enhancement in mean heat transfer is only marginal. Thereby, it falls far below the enhancement up to 300% that Dec and coworkers reported in their experimental results [17– 20]. It may also not explain the severe hardware damage of rocket motors attested by Harrje and coworkers. In conclusion, a rather contradictory picture of the magnitude of the enhancement in heat transfer exists in the literature. In a subsequent part of the study, van Buren et al expand the numerical investigation to larger pulsations amplitudes resulting in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal. For the adjusted set-up, an enhancement of mean heat transfer above of 100% well compares to the ﬁndings of numerous experimental investigations. It also presents an increase that explains the fatal destruction of combustion chambers due to exceedingly aggressive thermal conditions. The study offers a physical interpretation of the results and concludes that an overall increase in turbulent transport is responsible for the observed signiﬁcant enhancement of convective heat transfer. 5.03.02 Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer The previous Section 5.03.01 shed insight on the turbulence-induced enhancement of wall-normal heat transfer in combustion chambers. The signiﬁcant increase may explain the structural failure of the chamber walls or face-plate due to exceeded thermal loads. On the contrary, the transient heat-up of a resonator underlies a different heat transfer mechanism: As already discussed in Sec. 4, the axial temperature gradient along the resonator tube causes a heat ﬂux in the direction of the acoustic ﬂuid oscillation. However, these analytical derivations were limited to laminar ﬂows. In his study from 1985, Kurzweg himself suggested further investigations for the turbu- lent regime. Overall, precise knowledge of the temperature distribution inside the resonator is crucial for an accurate design of the resonator and thus for a safe design and operation of the combustion chamber and the entire engine (compare Sec. 5.01). To ﬁll this gap and to establish a more comprehensive picture of the effect of turbulence on longitudinal heat transfer, van Buren and Polifke (reproduced in the Appendix on p. 155 5.03 The Effect of Turbulence on Heat Transfer ff.) present a parametric investigation. The basic structure of the Large Eddy Simulation was adapted from the previous work on wall-normal heat transfer (solver, turbulence model, mesh, etc.). Adjustments of boundary conditions and evaluation methods allowed for investi- gating the present problem at hand. The numerical results of laminar ﬂows show excellent agreement with the analytical solution by Kurzweg (see Sec. 4.01.01). In the turbulent case, enhanced longitudinal heat transfer emerges for ﬂows characterized by the product of squared Womersley number α and Prandtl number Pr fulﬁlling α2 Pr > π. Transferring these characteristics to the application of rocket engine com- bustion chambers, the highlighted regime is of technical relevance since hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers are typically small compared to the resonator diameter ( δν ≈ δκ ≪ d, and thus α ≫ 1 and Pr ≈ 1). Thus, future design processes should account for the effect un- der investigation. Furthermore, the study provides a physical explanation for the enhancement: Turbulence increases the wall-normal heat transfer (compare Sec. 5.03.01) and thus increases the thermal penetration depth. Consequently, a wider cross-sectional area of the channel contributes to the convective longitudinal heat transfer. Contextualization and Discussion of Publications 6 Summary and Conclusions The present thesis addresses the effect of temperature inhomogeneities on the damping charac- teristic of acoustic quarter-wave resonators. A comprehensive investigation of heat transfer in turbulent oscillating ﬂows is given to derive the underlying temperature distributions. In partic- ular, the work focuses on (i) analytical models to gather in-depth knowledge about the physical mechanisms involved and on (ii) high-ﬁdelity ﬂuid dynamic simulations as a numerical design tool and for the parametric quantiﬁcation of turbulent effects. Starting from Rott’s thermoacoustic approximation, the thesis formulates characteristic acoustic waves (f and g-wave) accounting for the viscous and thermal losses of a channel ﬂow at homo- geneous temperature. In the next step, the previous derivations are used to model the acoustic damping properties of a quarter-wave resonator, namely its impedance or reﬂection coefﬁcient, respectively. The results compare well to an analytical analog of a mass-spring-damper system and numerical investigations. The thesis generalizes the correlations of lossy duct acoustics to linear temperature proﬁles under the assumption of temperature-independent viscosity. The results reveal a signiﬁcant ef- fect of the temperature on the acoustic eigenfrequency of a quarter-wave channel. For the more applied example of a temperature gradient within a quarter-wave resonator (e.g. in a rocket engine combustion chamber), the thesis presents a predictive numerical framework. It applies System-Identiﬁcation methods to calculate the acoustic impedance for arbitrary temperature distributions. Again, the underlying temperature signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the acoustic character- istic of the resonator (e.g. the eigenfrequency and the magnitude of acoustic reﬂection). The thesis clearly shows that the spatial mean temperature is insufﬁcient to describe the problem at hand. Instead, the accurate acoustic characterization of the resonator requires a more sophisti- cated knowledge of the local temperature distribution. After the ﬁrst part of the present thesis highlights the importance of the temperature distribution inside quarter-wave resonators, its second part focuses on two heat transfer mechanisms pre- vailing inside a rocket engine combustion chamber. The central challenges of this task are the highly turbulent ﬂow characteristics and the acoustical pulsations. This combination of condi- tions often connects to signiﬁcant heat transfer enhancement in the literature. Particularly during combustion instabilities that cause strong velocity and pressure oscillations, the increased ther- mal load may lead to severe damages or the destruction of the combustion chamber. However, related studies are of a rather qualitative nature. The author of the present thesis provides the ﬁrst numerical evidence for signiﬁcant enhancement of wall-normal heat transfer in a paramet- ric LES campaign. The reported enhancement of more than 100% clearly states the relevance of this phenomenon in a comprehensive design process. Longitudinal heat transfer in oscillating channel ﬂows (e.g. inside the tube of a quarter-wave resonator) presents the second challenging heat transfer mechanism. The thesis comprehen- Summary and Conclusions sively discusses the interplay of hydrodynamics and thermal boundary layers that generates an effective enhancement over the molecular thermal conductivity. The introduced Kurzweg num- ber accounts for the key factor of the thermal penetration depth as a non-dimensional parameter. Subsequently, the work on analytical considerations of laminar ﬂows is extended to turbulent ﬂows via high-ﬁdelity numerical simulations. A signiﬁcant turbulence-induced enhancement also shows for the case of longitudinal heat transfer. This is well explained by the wall-normal enhancement that increases the thermal penetration depth and thus the cross-sectional area con- tributing to the convective transport in the longitudinal direction. The author (separately) studied the impact of temperature on the acoustic damping characteris- tic of a quarter-wave resonator and the effect of oscillations on the heat transfer. However, when considering technical combustion applications (e.g. rocket engine combustion chambers), the two elements mentioned above are closely interrelated: Large acoustic oscillation amplitudes during combustion instabilities affect the heat transfer and thus the local temperature distribu- tion (e.g. inside a resonator tube). In direct consequence, the resulting change in temperature alters the damping performance of the resonator, which – in turn – changes the acoustics of the entire chamber. At this point, the loop closes as the acoustic amplitude directly impacts the heat transfer. One sees that a decoupled investigation of acoustic damping performance and heat transfer may not be feasible. Instead, a comprehensive design process requires a holistic treatment that simultaneously incorporates both effects. However, a classical numerical investigation easily exceeds the computational resources of the present project: On the one hand, large spatial and temporal scales are required to model the complete combustion chamber (including the resonator elements) over the extensive, transient heat-up period. On the other hand, very ﬁnely resolved scales are indispensable for the accurate modeling of the enhanced heat transfer via LES. More sophisticated numerical approaches may reduce the computational cost to a feasible amount. Regarding the large scales, network models can reduce the complexity of the combustion cham- ber. Linear state space systems account for parts of the geometry (e.g. the injector, ﬂame, and nozzle) – corresponding boundary conditions couple the CFD simulation of the resonator with the surrounding state space systems. For the small scales, wall models may incorporate the ef- fect of enhanced heat transfer. This approach signiﬁcantly decreases the ﬁne mesh resolution required for an LES. The present thesis provides a parametric data basis for designing such wall models. The results of the author’s work have been published in several papers. The key papers with the original abstracts and the respective contributions of the author are listed in the following sections. 6.01 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution. 6.01 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution and Damping Performance of Acoustic Resonators The ﬁnal report of the Collaborative Research Centres SFB-TRR 40 summarizes, interconnects and concludes the individual research topics of the third funding period, see Sec. 6. The book reﬂects the work of the author (representing research project A 3) within the context of the multidisciplinary research program. Original Abstract: A numerical framework for the prediction of acoustic damping character- istics is developed and applied to a quarter-wave resonator with non-uniform temperature. The results demonstrate a signiﬁcant impact of the temperature proﬁle on the damping character- istics and hence the necessity of accurate modeling of heat transfer in oscillating ﬂow. Large Eddy Simulations are applied to demonstrate and quantify enhancement in heat transfer induced by pulsations. The study covers wall-normal heat transfer in pulsating ﬂow as well as longitudi- nal convective effects in oscillating ﬂow. A discussion of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers provides insight into the ﬂow physics of oscillatory convective heat transfer.

Summary and Conclusions 6.02 Acoustic Impedance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Non-Uniform Temperature A numerical tool for the aeroacoustic characterization of a quarter-wave resonator with arbitrary temperature proﬁles is developed, see Sec. 5.01. This approach allows a ﬂexible investigation of the effect of temperature inhomogeneities (e.g. compare linear proﬁles in Sec. 2.03). Original Abstract: This study proposes a semi-analytical approach to predict the acoustic impedance of a quarter-wave resonator with non-uniform temperature. In analogy to well- known models for Helmholtz resonators, the quarter-wave resonator is represented as a mass- spring-damper system. The treatment is limited to polynomial temperature proﬁles, but does take into account that the resonator cavity is not acoustically compact. In order to assess the validity and accuracy of the semi-analytical results, computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations are carried out for a variety of temperature proﬁles in a quarter- wave resonator cavity. The acoustic reﬂection offered by the resonator opening to imposed incoming acoustic waves is evaluated, either by spectral analysis of time series generated by re- peated, monofrequent excitation, or by system identiﬁcation of acoustic signals generated with broad-band excitation. System identiﬁcation – a variant of supervised machine learning – re- quires only a single simulation run to characterize the resonator over the frequency range of interest. The validation study shows good quantitative agreement between the mono-frequent and broadband excitation cases, as well as qualitative consistency with the analytical predic- tions. The present study demonstrates that resonator eigenfrequencies as well as maximum effective- ness and bandwidth of acoustic damping are quite sensitive to temperature inhomogeneities. In the context of thermo-acoustic combustion instability, where resonators are frequently em- ployed as a means of passive control. The results suggest that the acoustic characteristics of a resonator with hot combustion products at the inlet and a cooled backing cannot be computed simply with a representative average of the temperature distribution. These ﬁndings underline the necessity of a comprehensive design process, which includes thermal analysis in order to assure optimum resonator effectiveness. Contribution: The research topic was jointly deﬁned by Prof. Wolfgang Polifke, Dr. Kilian Förner, and the lead author.

Original Abstract: Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer (ELHT) is a fascinating phenomenon in oscillatory channel ﬂow. Kurzweg (J. Heat Transf. 107, 1985) formulated a theoretical analy- sis of conjugate heat transfer for the case of laminar, single-phase, oscillatory ﬂow, which yields a correlation for ELHT in terms of Prandtl and Womersley numbers. The present investigation contributes physical interpretation to the results of Kurzweg. A simpliﬁed model with isother- mal walls is proposed, applicable if gaseous ﬂuid and metallic conﬁnement exhibit sufﬁciently large differences in thermal inertia. Examined over a wide range of Womersley numbers, this model reveals six distinct regimes characterized by the Prandtl number of the ﬂuid. The thick- ness of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers relative to the channel width is relevant in this context. Maximum ELHT is attained when the thermal boundary layer expands over the full channel width. The trend of ELHT vs. Womersley number is discussed and explained in terms of ﬂow physics by the interplay of hydrodynamic and thermal ﬂow characteristics. These patterns reveal either quasi-steady parabolic or oscillating bulk characteristics, respectively. The importance of the thermal boundary layer thickness motivates the introduction of a new non- dimensional group, which makes it easier to classify the various regimes of ELHT. Contribution: The research topic was jointly deﬁned by Prof. Wolfgang Polifke and the lead author. The lead author drew up the theoretical investigation and the manuscript. Prof. Wolfgang Polifke gave proofreading and suggestions for improvement. Status: This paper was submitted to and presented at the 18 th International Symposium on Transport Phenomena and Dynamics of Rotating Machinery (ISROMAC 18).

Summary and Conclusions 6.04 Large Eddy Simulation of Enhanced Heat Transfer in Pulsatile Turbulent Channel Flow Numerical evidence for signiﬁcant enhancement of wall-normal heat transfer in pulsatile turbu- lent channel ﬂow is given, see Sec. 5.03.01. The parametric study of Large Eddy Simulations is performed on an intrinsically generated turbulent ﬂow in a periodic simulation domain. Original Abstract: Heat transfer in pulsatile turbulent channel ﬂow is investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation. Incompressible ﬂow within a periodic computational domain is driven by a pulsating axial pressure gradient at a turbulent Reynolds number of Reτ = 350. A localized dynamic sub-grid scale approach is chosen to model unclosed stress terms. A layer-averaged sub-grid model determines turbulent Prandtl numbers that depend on wall distance. Compared to the existing literature, a much wider range of oscillation parameters is studied. In particular, forcing frequencies correspond to Womersley numbers from Wo = 14 to 70, while forcing am- plitudes reach values that result in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal, i.e. reverse ﬂow velocities up to ﬁve times larger than the mean ﬂow velocity. At moderate pulsation amplitudes, i.e. in the range of emerging ﬂow reversal, strong deviations of instantaneous heat transfer rates from the temporal mean are observed. Particularly at times of ﬂow reversal, an increase in heat transfer up to 60% above non-pulsatile values is observed. However, when averaging over a complete cycle, any enhancement in mean heat transfer is only minor. On the other hand, simulations at larger pulsations amplitudes that result in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal, show a enhancement of mean heat transfer in excess of 100%. Note that such signiﬁcant enhancement of heat transfer has not been reported previously in Large Eddy Sim- ulation of turbulent pulsatile ﬂow. The paper offers a physical interpretation of the results and concludes that an overall increase in turbulent transport is responsible for the observed signiﬁ- cant enhancement of convective heat transfer. Contribution: The original research topic was jointly deﬁned by Prof. Wolfgang Polifke and Dr. Alejandro Cárdenas Miranda. Dr. Alejandro Cárdenas Miranda developed a framework for a numerical experiment. However, his simulation campaign did not reproduce the expected results of enhanced heat transfer (see ). Therefore, Prof. Wolfgang Polifke and the lead author jointly readdressed and redeﬁned the research topic. The lead author contributed the complete redesign of the solver and the turbulence models. After the lead author recognized the signiﬁcance of increased pulsation amplitudes, he conducted the parametric simulation campaign and prepared the manuscript. All co-authors gave proofreading and suggestions for improvement. Status: Published in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer (IJHMT). Scopus listed.

The numerical set-up is based on the previous work of wall-normal heat transfer, see Sec. 5.03.01. Results are compared to the laminar reference by Kurzweg, see Sec. 4.01.01. Original Abstract: An analytical correlation for longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory ﬂow was proposed by Kurzweg. However, the treatment was limited to laminar ﬂows, which motivates the extension of the analysis to the turbulent regime. In the present paper, turbulence- induced enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow is investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and supplemented with analytical considerations. Incompressible ﬂow within a periodic computational domain is driven by an oscillating lon- gitudinal pressure gradient, generating both laminar and turbulent ﬂow characteristics. A wide range of oscillation amplitudes is considered, while a constant axial temperature gradient is maintained at the upper and lower channel walls. Kurzweg’s analytical correlation for effective longitudinal thermal diffusivity is simpliﬁed to match the numerical setup. The numerical results of laminar ﬂows show excellent agreement with the analytical solution. In the turbulent case, enhanced longitudinal heat transfer emerges for ﬂows characterized by the product of squared Womersley number α and Prandtl number Pr fulﬁlling α2 Pr = π. In order to explain this observation, the interaction of wall-conﬁned thermal and hydrodynamics Stokes boundary layers is scrutinized, a simple correlation for the effective thermal diffusivity in lami- nar oscillatory ﬂow is deduced from the analysis. This model consolidates the two phenomena of wall-normal heat transfer and the longitudinal convective transport. Finally, the correlation is expanded to account for the impact of turbulence intensity on heat transfer. This quantiﬁcation compares favorably against the wall-normal heat transfer, which reveals similar characteristic features. Contribution: The research topic was jointly deﬁned by Prof. Wolfgang Polifke and the lead author. First numerical set-ups of a laminar reference case were collaboratively established with Joachim Ottinger in his bachelor thesis, which the lead author closely supervised. The lead author extended the numerical implementation to turbulent ﬂows and conducted the parametric investigation and its evaluation. Furthermore, the lead author prepared the manuscript.

Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on T emperature Distribution and Damping Performance of Acoustic Resonators Simon van Buren and Wolfgang Polifke Abstract A numerical framework for the prediction of acoustic damping character- istics is developed and applied to a quarter-wave resonator with non-uniform temper- ature. The results demonstrate a signiﬁcant impact of the temperature proﬁle on the damping characteristics and hence the necessity of accurate modeling of heat transfer in oscillating ﬂow. Large Eddy Simulations are applied to demonstrate and quantify enhancement in heat transfer induced by pulsations. The study covers wall-normal heat transfer in pulsating ﬂow as well as longitudinal convective effects in oscillating ﬂow. A discussion of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers provides insight into the ﬂow physics of oscillatory convective heat transfer. 1 Introduction and Placement in SFB Combustion instabilities jeopardize the structural integrity of rocket combustion chambers. One measure to ensure safe operating conditions is the application of acoustic resonators to suppress the thermo-acoustic feedback. Modern engines such as the Vulcain 2 combustion chamber include L-shaped quarter-wave resonators. Due to regenerative cooling, large temperature differences exist between the hot com- bustion gases and the cooled chamber walls. The transient heat-up process brings additional uncertainty.

Polifke During the ﬁrst funding period of SFB Transregio 40, A. Cardenas developed analytical correlations for the acoustic damping characteristics of a quarter-wave resonator, which indicate that the impact of temperature inhomogeneities is signiﬁ- cant. Thus accurate acoustic predictions require the detailed knowledge of the temperature distribution within a resonator. In this context, the turbulent pulsating nature of the ﬂow in the resonator presents a crucial challenge for the modeling of heat transfer. Experimental results that reported signiﬁcant enhancement of average heat transfer could not be reproduced in numerical simulations [ 20]. Low-order net- work models were developed to evaluate rocket engine combustion stability under the inﬂuence of acoustic resonators. During the second funding period, K. Förner identiﬁed and quantiﬁed signiﬁcant non-linear effects resulting from large oscillation amplitudes (e.g. vortex shedding). This implies a high degree of uncertainty for the analytical correlations derived by Cardenas. On the contrary, high-resolution numerical studies are not prone to these inaccuracies. In the ﬁnal funding period, S. van Buren merged the two prior lines of study: A numerical framework to predict acoustic damping characteristics was developed and applied to quarter-wave resonators with local temperature inhomogeneities. Sub- sequently, heat transfer in turbulent pulsation ﬂows was revisited and the range of investigations was extended to larger oscillation amplitudes. Indeed, signiﬁcant wall- normal enhancement of heat transfer could be conﬁrmed at increased amplitudes. To account for the geometry of a quarter-wave resonator tube, the investigations were extended to convective longitudinal effects in oscillating ﬂows. Based on the focus on heat transfer, the present project is assigned to the research area Structural Cooling (RA A). The integrated acoustic examination of the resonator in the Combustion Chamber reveals additional close connection to RA C. 2 Impact of T emperature Inhomogeneities on Damping Performance A variety of analytical correlations to quantify the damping characteristic of acoustic resonators have been derived in analogy to mass-spring-damper systems (e.g. [ 15, 16, 21]). For the case of a Helmholtz resonator, the acoustically compact ﬂuid in the neck section presents the oscillating mass (velocity ﬂuctuation u′, compare Figs. 1 and 2). The compressible ﬂuid in the cavity (volume V ) acts as the restoring spring. Damping is induced by either viscous friction in the neck section (losses linear to the velocity perturbation u′) or vortex shedding ( non-linear losses of higher order). In particular the latter introduces a large degree of uncertainty. Laudien et al [ 19] extended prior studies to the geometry of a quarter-wave res- onator (Fig. 3). The difﬁculty connected to this geometry is the increased axial length scale (quarter-wave length at eigenfrequency) that violates the assumption of acous- A.1 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution.

Redrawn from [ 20] Fig. 4 Polynomial and average temperature proﬁle in the neck and volume regions in a quarter-wave resonator tic compactness. Laudien’s model is restricted to a homogeneous ﬂuid temperature, as it has a signiﬁcant impact on the local density ρ and thus on the speed of sound c. Resonators used in combustion chambers are generally exposed to signiﬁcant temperature gradients. Figure 4 shows a schematic axial temperature distribution within a quarter-wave resonator: Hot combustion gas dominates at the front opening, whereas the backing of the cavity is exposed to regenerative cooling. During the ﬁrst funding period of SFB Transregio 40 Cardenas [ 20] extended an approach by Reproduction of Papers 100 S. van Buren and W.

Based on the analytical solution by Kumar and Sujith, applicable temperature proﬁles T (x) are mathematically restricted to a polynomial form: T (x) = (ax + b)n. (1) The analytical model of Cardenas [ 20] revealed that temperature inhomogeneities have a signiﬁcant impact on the damping performance, i.e. they cause a shift in eigen- frequency, a reduction of the effective frequency range and the minimum reﬂection coefﬁcient. The frequency-dependent reﬂection coefﬁcient R(ω) quantiﬁes the ratio of the reﬂected acoustic wave g to the incident wave f : R(ω) = g f. (2) Subsequently, a numerical framework based on computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) for the calculation of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R(ω) was presented and applied to quarter-wave resonators with temperature inhomogeneities by van Buren [ 2, 3]. The resonator is modeled by two- or three-dimensional wedge geometries with an imposed temperature proﬁle. Incident acoustic waves are imposed in the form of harmonic as well as broadband forcing. The time series data generated with the latter approach is post-processed by system identiﬁcation (SI)—a form of supervised machine learning—and only requires one single simulation to determine results for a wide range of frequencies. Central advantages over the analytical model are the ﬂexibility of arbitrary temperature distributions and the incorporation of non-linear effects. Details on the numerical framework and simulation setup are given in [ 2, 3]. Figure 5 compares numerical results of harmonic and broadband forcing (CFD/SI). Overall, the qualitative and quantitative agreement is very good. This generates con- ﬁdence in both methods. The plot also illustrates the physical impact of tempera- A.1 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution.

As the gradient between cooled backing and hot front open- ing is increased a signiﬁcant shift in eigenfrequency is introduced ( ω ≈ 4600 Hz to 5000 Hz). Furthermore, the effective frequency range of damping narrows and the minimum reﬂection coefﬁcient R decreases. Both effects reduce the effectiveness of the resonator as a damper of thermo-acoustic instabilities. Figure 6 compares CFD/SI results with the analytical correlation. There is quali- tative agreement but quantitative offset in both frequency and reﬂection coefﬁcient. 3 Impact of Acoustic Oscillations on Heat Transfer The accurate computation of the acoustic characteristics of the resonator requires pre- cise knowledge of the local temperature distribution of the working ﬂuid. Therefore, fundamental understanding of heat transfer in the presence of strong acoustic per- turbations is indispensable. For the problem at hand, physical boundary conditions deﬁne two categories of heat transfer [ 20]: First, within the combustion chamber, wall normal heat transfer from the hot ﬂuid to the cooled wall occurs in turbulent pulsating ﬂows. The pulsations originate from the superposition of a mean-ﬂow and acoustic velocity perturbations. Second, within the resonator tube, axial heat transfer from the hot front section to the cooled backing of the cavity exists. In contrast to the ﬁrst category, mean-ﬂow is absent here, one speaks of oscillating ﬂow. Figure 7 illustrates the modeling of an acoustically compact duct section at the position of a pressure node: In the small domain from x = X to x = X + dx,p r e s - sure perturbation p 3 are not present, whereas acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations u are maximum. The selection of this domain of interest is consistent with numerous pre- vious studies, which report that enhancement in heat transfer coincides with velocity ﬂuctuations rather than pressure oscillations [ 8–10, 14].

The channel is conﬁned by two walls of distance 2 h. For the investigation of wall-normal heat transfer, these walls are constrained to homogeneous but different temperatures (Th and Tc as shown in the ﬁgure). In the second case of longitudinal heat trans- fer, constant axial temperature gradients are applied. Cyclic conditions apply to the remaining four boundary patches. One central advantage of this setup is the gener- ation of fully developed turbulent ﬂow without the requirement of turbulent inﬂow conditions. The ﬂow is driven by a momentum source term Smom that accounts for the acoustic oscillations via the spatial gradient of the pressure perturbation p′ and for the mean-ﬂow via the gradient of the overall pressure P 0 (compare Fig. 7). More detailed information of the incompressible Large Eddy Simulation is pro- vided in [ 1, 4], including the selection of turbulence models, a mesh independence study and the validation against analytical, experimental and numerical results. 3.01 W all Normal Heat Transfer In this section, the core ﬁndings for wall-normal heat transfer in turbulent pulsating channel ﬂows are presented and discussed. More detailed results are provided in [ 1, 4].

(4) Lastly, the non-dimensional Stokes’ length l+ s is introduced as a measure for the pulsation frequency: l+ s = uτ ν δs = Reτ h δs, (5) where Re τ is the the turbulent Reynolds number and δs = (2ω/ν)1/2 the classical Stokes length. During the ﬁrst funding period, numerical simulations by Cardenas [ 20] could not reproduce experimental results that report EHT of more than 100%. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study investigates ﬂows at increased turbulent Reynolds number Re τ = 350 (instead of Re τ ≈ 180). Furthermore, the numerical framework includes the dynamic calculation of locally resolved turbulent Prandtl numbers. Figure 9 depicts the temporal average of enhancement in heat transfer versus pulsa- tion strength ϵ for various frequencies l+ s. EHT is most pronounced at frequencies around l+ s ≈ 14 and velocity amplitudes close to ﬂow reversal (i.e. ϵ ≈ 1). In the parameter range under investigation, only minor effects of EHT conﬁrm the results by Cardenas [ 20]. A time-resolved investigation over one pulsation period reveals signiﬁcant variation in EHT, ranging from strong reduction (larger than 50%) to clear enhancement (up to 45%, Fig. 10) The local maximum in EHT at ϵ ≈ 1 led originally to the conclusion that LES does not capture pronounced EHT [ 20]. However, this conclusion was premature. Indeed, examination of the time-resolved heat transfer (Fig. 10) strongly indicates the relevance of large ﬂow velocities. This suggested the extension of the parame- ter range under investigation and to increase the pulsation strength to values beyond Reproduction of Papers 104 S. van Buren and W.

The plateau in Fig. 11 (dashed blue line) shows that no signiﬁcant enhance- ment in heat transfer develops below velocity amplitudes corresponding to ϵ< 2, but for larger amplitudes ( ϵ> 2), a clear and signiﬁcant increase in EHT develops. Despite numerous difference in physical modelling and numerical setup, the results qualitatively agree with the work of Wang and Zhang [ 22]. The signiﬁcant enhance- ment in heat transfer is well explained by Fig. 12: At pulsation amplitudes close to ﬂow reversal (e.g. ϵ = 1.04), times of ﬂow velocities close to rest hinder an overall (time-averaged) enhancement. In the case of signiﬁcant ﬂow reversal, these times of ﬂow stagnation are quickly surpassed, providing longer intervals at large ﬂow velocities. A.1 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution. Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature … 105 3.02 Longitudinal Heat Transfer The computational setup for the study of wall-normal heat transfer in pulsating tur- bulent ﬂow is modiﬁed to account for a longitudinal convective mechanism ﬁrst studied by Kurzweg [ 18]. Kurzweg derived a closed analytical expression for axial heat transfer in oscillatory laminar channel ﬂows constrained by a constant axial temperature gradient. The velocity oscillations enhance the molecular thermal diffu- sivity by orders of magnitude: The ﬂuid receives a wall heat ﬂux at the hot reversal point, oscillates to the cold reversal point and returns its thermal energy to the walls. During the ﬁnal funding period of SFB Transregio 40, van Buren applied LES to extend Kurzweg’s investigations to turbulent ﬂows. Details on the numerical setup, results and discussions are given in [ 5, 7] Kurzweg proposed an effective thermal diffusivity κe. In its non-dimensional form, this diffusivity is normalized by the angular frequency ω of the oscillation and the square of the tidal displacement /Delta 1 x 2: κe/ω/Delta 1 x 2. The red line in Fig. 13 shows Kurzweg’s analytical results for effective thermal diffusivity over the Prandtl number Pr of the ﬂuid. In agreement with the previous numerical study, l+ s = 14 was selected. This correlates with a Womersley number of Wo ≈ 35 and indicates thin hydrodynamic boundary layers compared to the channel width. Numerical results are displayed by the blue, orange, yellow and purple line, which are ordered by increasing oscillation strength. The lower two amplitudes generate laminar ﬂow conditions and show overall agreement with the analytical correlation. At larger amplitudes, deviations appear at high Prandtl numbers, exceeding the location of the peak at Wo 2 Pr ≈ π. These differences induced by the onset of turbulence are more apparent in the semi-logarithmic presentation in Fig. 14. The turbulence-induced enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer ϵturb is deﬁned as the effective thermal diffusivity κe in respect to its laminar reference. In the spectrum of technically relevant Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr ≈ 0.07 for air), an increase of 100% is expected. Future numerical investigations will extend the range of Prandtl numbers to these values.

To interpret the results, recall that the oscillating ﬂuid is characterized by thin hydrodynamic boundary layers (i.e. Wo ≈ 35). The left plot of Fig. 15 shows a ﬂuid Prandtl number of Pr = 0.00025. This indicates a thermal boundary layer clearly exceeding its hydrodynamic counterpart. The plot reveals that the complete cross-sectional area of the channel ( η = z/h) contributes to the longitudinal heat transfer. This is because disturbances in the temperature distribution propagate throughout the entire channel up to its center- plane. For increasing Prandtl numbers (center: Pr = 0.0025, right Pr = 0.025), this wall-normal propagation is limited by the thermal conductivity. As a consequence, centered sections of the channel do not contribute to the convective transport any- more. In particular, the laminar setup is restricted to small wall-conﬁned regions. The enhancement induced by turbulence is explained by an increase in wall normal heat ﬂux, which increases the effective cross-sectional area. van Buren and Polifke [ 1] also proposed a turbulence-related convective heat transfer coefﬁcient hturb. In the range of thin hydrodynamic boundary layers, this one-dimensional modeling approach—based on assumptions of bulk velocities and bulk temperatures outside of the boundary layer—predicts a scaling of ϵturb with the square-root of the Prandtl number Pr. A comprehensive discussion of interactions between hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers is provided in [ 6]. Figure 16 shows qualitative agreement of the numerical results (colored lines) and the analytic prediction (black dotted lines). The turbulence-dependent coefﬁcient hturb is evaluated at Pr = 0.025. According to its deﬁnition (details are given in [ 1]), the coefﬁcient is zero for laminar ﬂows and increases with oscillation amplitude or turbulence intensity, respectively. This is denoted by the non-dimensional forcing amplitude λ. The trend of the turbulent coefﬁcient hturb versus the forcing amplitude λ is depicted in Fig. 17. Up to the laminar-to-turbulent transition, hturb is zero. At this threshold a signiﬁcant increase is attributed to the initial onset of turbulence. With increasing amplitudes in the turbulent regime, the enhancement continuously decays. A.1 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution.

Polifke Although there are numerous physical deviations between the setup of wall- normal and longitudinal enhancement in heat transfer (e.g. pulsating vs. oscillat- ing ﬂow, wall-normal vs. longitudinal temperature gradient,), results of the wall- normal study are also included in Fig.17. Note that some characteristic features compare qualitatively: For both ﬂows, there is certain threshold in forcing amplitude (i.e. λ ≈ 160) beyond which overall heat transfer clearly increases. For the longi- tudinal heat transfer, this is explained by the laminar-to-turbulent transition. Due to the mean-ﬂow, the wall-normal setup is always turbulent. Interestingly—and in agreement with conclusions given in [ 1]—signiﬁcant EHT does not develop below this threshold. Furthermore, both results show a declining growth with increasing amplitude in the turbulent regime. 4 Summary and Conclusions A numerical framework for the quantitative prediction of acoustic damping char- acteristics was developed and applied to quarter-wave resonators with temperature inhomogeneities. The results conﬁrm the analytical ﬁnding of the ﬁrst funding period, i.e. that the temperature distribution within the resonator has a signiﬁcant impact and cannot be represented adequately by only the mean temperature. Central advantages of the numerical approach are the ﬂexibility of arbitrary temperature distributions and the resolved investigation of non-linear losses (e.g. vortex shedding). It is self- evident that accurate acoustic predictions require precise knowledge of the present temperature distribution. First LES-based evidence for signiﬁcantly enhanced wall-normal heat transfer in turbulent pulsating ﬂow was given. This conﬁrms experimental studies that report enhancement of more than 100%. The present work provides quantitative results that cover a wide range of forcing frequencies and pulsation amplitudes. Below velocity amplitudes of signiﬁcant ﬂow reversals, the time-averaged enhancement of heat transfer is marginal. First with signiﬁcant ﬂow reversal ( ϵ ≈ 2.05), periods of ﬂow stagnation quickly pass and allow for major enhancement of more than 100%. The present study demonstrates the risk-potential to the thermal integrity of rocket engine combustion chambers: Extreme thermal loads are opposed to restrictions in design and material properties, resulting in little safety margins. Unforeseen enhancement in ﬂuid-to-wall heat transfer during the design process may result in a catastrophic destruction of the chamber. Within the resonator tube, longitudinal convective effects in oscillating ﬂows are evaluated. In the range of physically relevant Prandtl numbers (e.g. air with Pr ≈ 0.07), the effective thermal diffusivity enhances signiﬁcantly. Based on a comprehensive examination of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers, a simple model quanti- ﬁes the impact of turbulence. The present study sheds light on the complexity of a comprehensive design process of rocket combustion chambers. In particular, the close interdependence between acoustics and heat transfer requires a holistic treatment: The acoustic amplitude A.1 Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature Distribution. Heat Transfer in Pulsating Flow and Its Impact on Temperature … 109 has an impact on heat transfer and thus on the temperature distribution. The local temperature—in turn—inﬂuences the damping characteristic of the acoustic res- onators. One possible consequence is the shift in effective damping frequency and thus an overall change in acoustic amplitude (closing the feedback-loop at hand). Furthermore, non-linear damping effects present a second direct coupling mecha- nism between acoustic amplitude and the damping characteristics of the resonator. To conclude, these interdependences do not allow for a decoupled analysis of acoustics and heat transfer. In regards to a numerically supported design process, this ﬁnding comes along with major challenges in the selection of length and time scales. On the one hand, highly resolved LES are required to capture effect of EHT and vortex shedding. On the other hand, the length scale of the combustion chamber has to be considered over the time scale of the transient heating process. In future studies, sophisticated approaches that make use of reduced-order models might overcome current restrictions imposed by computational resources. This may include an itera- tive procedure between the different orders in time scales or an evaluation of EHT by an imposed wall model. From an applied point of view, one is well advised to adhere to the established practice of placing the resonator openings adjacent to cool recirculation zones, where only minor changes in temperature are expected, in order to avoid the complications discussed.

Reproduction of Papers Annual Congress of the International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIA V) ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE OF A QUARTER-WAVE RESONATOR WITH NON-UNIFORM TEMPERATURE Simon van Buren, Kilian Förner and Wolfgang Polifke Technical University of Munich, Garching, Germany e-mail: vanburen@tfd.mw.tum.de This study proposes a semi-analytical approach to predict the acoustic impedance of a quarter-wave resonator with non-uniform temperature. In analogy to well-known models for Helmholtz resonators, the quarter-wave resonator is represented as a mass-spring-damper system. The treatment is limited to polynomial temperature proﬁles, but does take into account that the resonator cavity is not acoustically compact. In order to assess the validity and accuracy of the semi-analytical results, computational ﬂuid dy- namics (CFD) simulations are carried out for a variety of temperature proﬁles in a quarter-wave res- onator cavity. The acoustic reﬂection offered by the resonator opening to imposed incoming acoustic waves is evaluated, either by spectral analysis of time series generated by repeated, monofrequent excitation, or by system identiﬁcation of acoustic signals generated with broad-band excitation. Sys- tem identiﬁcation – a variant of supervised machine learning – requires only a single simulation run to characterize the resonator over the frequency range of interest. The validation study shows good quan- titative agreement between the mono-frequent and broadband excitation cases, as well as qualitative consistency with the analytical predictions. The present study demonstrates that resonator eigenfrequencies as well as maximum effectiveness and bandwidth of acoustic damping are quite sensitive to temperature inhomogeneities. In the context of thermo-acoustic combustion instability, where resonators are frequently employed as a means of passive control. The results suggest that the acoustic characteristics of a resonator with hot combustion products at the inlet and a cooled backing cannot be computed simply with a representative average of the temperature distribution. These ﬁndings underline the necessity of a comprehensive design process, which includes thermal analysis in order to assure optimum resonator effectiveness. Keywords: acoustic resonator, temperature inhomogeneity, CFD 1. Introduction Combustion instabilities jeopardize the structural integrity of combustion chambers. One measure to ensure safe operating conditions is the installation of acoustic resonators to increase overall acoustic dissipation and to suppress the thermo-acoustic feedback. For optimal performance, resonators need to be tuned to eigenfrequencies of instabilities. Large temperature gradients exist between the hot combustion gases and the cooled chamber walls. Furthermore, acoustic pulsations in the turbulent ﬂow enhance the A.2 Acoustic Impedance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Non-Uniform Temperature heat transfer. In consequence, the local variations in the speed of sound affect the frequency range of damping. In coupled analysis of combustion chamber and resonator elements, Chemnitz et al showed the high sensitivity of global stability toward the damping characteristics of the resonator. Already minor changes in the damping eigenfrequency may cause fatal destruction of the chamber. Thus, a reliable quantiﬁcation of the effects of temperature inhomogeneities on the resonator eigenfrequency is crucial for the design of safe operating. In 1896, Rayleigh modeled the Helmholtz resonator as a mass-spring-damper system. Since then, many authors (see e. g. ) used this analogy to describe the behavior of acoustic resonators in a semi-analytical way. Cárdenas adapted the model for quarter-wave resonators and accounts also for temperature inhomogeneities inside the resonator. This formulation is reviewed in the following and extended to the speciﬁc needs of the present study. The semi-analytical model serves as reference for the validation of the CFD setup presented in Section 4. 2. Acoustic Quantities The reﬂection coefﬁcient R(ω) characterizes the acoustic damping of a resonator in frequency domain (ˆ.-operator): R(ω) = ˆg(ω) ˆf(ω), (1) where ω is the angular frequency. It evaluates the ratio of the one-dimensional characteristic waves, traveling up- and downstream (f and g-wave, compare Figs. 1 and 2) f = 1 (p′ ¯ρ¯c + u′ ) and g= 1 (p′ ¯ρ¯c −u′ ). (2) where p′is the pressure ﬂuctuation, u′the velocity ﬂuctuation, ¯ρthe mean density and ¯cthe mean speed of sound. The reﬂection coefﬁcient Rand the acoustic impedance Z ≡ˆp/ˆu= Φ + iΨ are linked via: R(ω) = Z(ω) −¯ρ¯c Z(ω) + ¯ρ¯c, (3) where Φ is the resistance, while Ψ is the reactance. 3. Analytical Model The presented analytical model for the acoustic impedance Zcombines two independent approaches. The mass-spring-damper analogy allows to determine the resistance. First introduced by Rayleigh in 1896, the analogy has often been applied and reﬁned. For example, Ingard as well as Keller and Zauner extended the model semi-analytically to describe the damping behavior of Helmholtz resonators, as shown in Fig. 1. Laudien et al investigated a way of transferring the concept to quarter- wave resonators. In the present work, this approach is extended to account for temperature inhomo- geneities. The reactance of the resonator is modeled in accordance with Cárdenas. 3.01 Resistance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Temperature Inhomogeneities The differential equation that describes the mass-spring-damper system consists of four fundamental components: the inertia of the mass (ﬂuid in the neck), the restoring force of the spring (gas in the backing cavity of length l), the damping (viscous friction and non-linear effects) and the excitation by an external ICSV 27, Annual Congress of International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIA V), Prague, 12-16 July 2020 Reproduction of Papers p′ ¯cv, ¯ρv l leﬀ u′ d ¯cn, ¯ρn δo V δi f g Figure 1: Sketch of a Helmholtz resonator, with highlighted oscillating ﬂuid mass in the neck re- gion.

In order to obtain the frequency-based damping characteristics for an excitation p′and assumed linear response u′, the Fourier transformed (q′= ˆqeiωt) system reads: (1 + s)(lr + δlo)¯ρnωiˆu−[s¯ρn(l+ d)ω) + ξ¯ρn ˆu] ˆu+ An ¯ρv¯c 2 v Vω iˆu= ˆp. (4) The representative neck length lr (compare Fig.2) corresponds to the length at which the eigenfre- quency of the mass-spring-damper system corresponds to the geometric eigenfrequency of the quarter- wave resonator. This approach, accounting for temperature inhomogeneities, is presented in Sec- tion 3.03. An additional portion of mass located at the tube directly outside of the resonator (index o) is taken into account by the end correction δlo. For small neck diameters ( d/D ≪1) a semi-analytical approx- imation for the length δlo ≈4 d/(3π) is given by Munjal. The effective neck length leﬀ is deﬁned as the length from the back of the tube to the mouth, including the correction δlo: leﬀ = l+ δlo. (5) In cylindrical ducts the boundary-layer parameter s, accounting for viscous effect within a small Stokes boundary layer δs/d≪1, is deﬁned as: s= 1 d ( 1 + γ−1√ Pr ) δs with δs = √2µ ρω, (6) where Pr denotes the Prandtl number, µthe dynamic viscosity and γthe ratio of speciﬁc heats. To eliminate the non-linearity in the dissipation term of Eq. (4), Keller and Zauner introduced a factor ϵnl: ξ¯ρn ˆu 2 ≈ϵnls¯ρndωˆu. In this study, the non-linear inﬂuence is negligible (ϵnl = 0). The resistance of the quarter-wave resonator is obtained as the real part of the impedance, which is derived by the rearrangement of Eq. (4): Φ = ( 1 + γ−1√ Pr )( 1 + ϵnl + lr d )√ 2¯ρnµω. (7) 3.02 Reactance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Temperature Inhomogeneities Since the backing cavity of a quarter-wave resonator cannot be assumed to be acoustically compact, Cárdenas developed a general correlation for the acoustic reactance. Based on an approach by Kumar ICSV 27, Annual Congress of International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIA V), Prague, 12-16 July 2020 A.2 Acoustic Impedance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Non-Uniform Temperature and Sujith, the closed-form expression for the reactance of a resonator with a polynomial temperature proﬁle, T(x) = (ax+ b)n, (8) reads: Ψ = − [ i¯ρchω((a+ νσ)P−ν(βTσ 1 )Pν(b Tσ 2 ) + βσP−1−ν(b Tσ) 1 )Pν(b Tσ 2 )Tσ −P−ν(βTσ 2 ) ((α−νσ)Pν(βTσ 1 ) + βσP−1+ν(βT 1 s)Tσ 1 ))T 1/N ] / [an(((α−νσ)Pν(b Tσ 1 ) + βσP−1+ν(βTσ 1 )Tσ 1 ) ((α+ νσ)P−ν(βTσ 2 ) + βσP−1−ν(βTσ 2 )Tσ 2 ) −((α+ νσ)P−ν(βTσ 1 ) + βσP−1−ν(βTσ 1 )Tσ 1 ) ((α−νσ)Pν(βTσ 2 ) + βσP−1+ν(βTσ 2 )Tσ 2 ))], (9) where Pn denotes the Bessel function of ﬁrst kind with order n. The parameter αβ σand νread: α= 1 (1 n −1 ), β = ω an√γRsσ, σ = (1 n −1 ) and ν = 1 −n 2 −n. (10) For a given resonator geometry and temperature proﬁle, the reactance Ψ is a function of the angular frequency ω. 3.03 Calculation of the Representative Neck Length The temperature proﬁle T(x) (compare Fig. 4) anchors at the cooled wall at the back of the resonator at T = Tcool, and the temperature increases to T = Tch just outside the resonator opening. Two overlap- ping ﬂuid regions are deﬁned in the resonator: the backing volume at an average temperature of Tv, and the neck region at Tn (compare Fig. 2). Following Laudien et al, the eigenfrequency of the mass-spring-damper system selected that the representative length lr agrees with the quarter-wave frequency of the resonator. The latter is deﬁned by the angular frequency ωeig for which the reactance Ψ (Eq. (9) of the quarter-wave resonator equals zero. The undamped angular eigenfrequency of the mass-spring-damper system is given as the square-root of the ratio of the spring-constant to the mass. Applying this to the analogy obtained in Eq. (4) yields the eigenfrequency feig (with f = ω/(2π)): feig = ¯cv 2π √ An V(1 + s)(lr + δlo) ¯ρv ¯ρn. (11) In Eq. (11), the average density for the neck and the backing volume region are calculated by utilizing the perfect-gas equation of state to describe the correlation between the local density and the temperature proﬁle: ¯ρn = ∫leﬀ l−lr ¯ρ(x)dx leﬀ −(l−lr) = ∫leﬀ l−lr p Rs T(x) dx lr + δlo, ¯ρv = ∫l 0 ¯ρ(x)dx l = ∫l p Rs T(x) dx l. (12) Using Eqs. (11) to (12), the representative neck length lr can be calculated as a function of the tem- perature proﬁle and serves as input parameter for the resistance, deﬁned in Eq. (7).

Numerical Implementation In the present study, the authors present a numerical framework to quantify the damping behavior of a quarter-wave resonator with non-uniform temperature. As an advantage over the analytical model, this approach allows for arbitrary temperature distributions. Furthermore, the numerical method does not require for empirical parameters (e.g. the non-linear coefﬁcient). This section describes the numerical case setup, including the geometrical domain, initial and bound- ary conditions and solver settings. The evaluation via System-Identiﬁcation follows. The axis-symmetric wedge domain consists of the quarter-wave resonator (length land neck radius rn) attached to a ﬂow channel (length l 0 and radius r 0, compare Fig. 3). At the left inlet boundary interface, the planar inward-traveling f-wave is applied via a Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Condition (NSCBC). The reﬂected outward-traveling g-wave is evaluated at a reference plane, located at a distance lref from opening of the resonator. The length lref is chosen to be sufﬁciently large for reﬂected g-waves to develop planar characteristics. All boundary conditions, besides the inlet, are adiabatic. At the physical walls of the resonator and the channel face plate, no-slip conditions are applied for the ﬂuid ﬂow, while the circumference boundary of the channel shows slip characteristics. Considering the axial symmetry of the geometry, a structured graded mesh is generated as a two- dimensional grid with a wedge angle α = 4◦. The Stokes boundary layer at the walls is resolved with 9 cells, yielding a minimum cell size of dcell,min ≈8.00 ·10−6 m at frequencies of f ≈4700 Hz. In agreement with the temperature proﬁle of the analytical approach, the geometry is divided at the effective resonator length (see the purple area in Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the temperature within the resonator from the backing wall ( Tcool) to the effective length leﬀ (Tch). Inside the channel volume, the homogeneous temperature Tch is applied. Further initial condition is a constant pressure pof the resting ﬂuid (u= 0). The parameters for the numerical setup are summarized in Table 1. An extended version of the compressible solverrho Pimple Foam of the software Open FOAM 2.03.01 is used. For this study, both harmonic and broadband excitation are applied. The evaluation of the CFD results excited by a broadband input-signal is realized by System-Identiﬁcation (CFD/SI). Based on the studies by Förner and Polifke, the identiﬁcation process utilizes the output-error model: g[k] = B Ff[k] + e[k]. (13) Considering discrete-time signals, f[k] is the input ( f-wave) at time-step k, g[k] is the output ( g-wave) and e[k] is Gaussian white noise. B and F denote polynomials in the time shift operator. Appropriate orders of these polynomials are 3 for Band 2 for F.

Results For the presentation of the results, ﬁve polynomial temperature proﬁles are selected. The mean tem- perature is set to be constant at Tmean = 647 K, while the temperature at the cooled resonator back is varied. Thereby, the hot channel temperature results as a dependent quantity. 5.01 Analytical Results The results of the analytical correlation (Eq. (9)) are presented in Fig. 5. The colormap shows the gain of the reﬂection coefﬁcient vs. frequency and temperature ratio. First, an increase of the temperature gradient leads to an increase of the eigenfrequncy up to a maximum atfeig,max ≈4980 Hz. Afterwards, a decline of the eigenfrequency is observed. The evaluation of discrete temperature ratios is shown in Fig. 6. In addition to the shift of eigenfre- quencies, this plot clearly reveals an increase of the maximum damping performance for higher temper- ature ratios: for a constant temperature proﬁle Tch = Tcool = Tmean = 647 K, a gain of |R|≈ 0.058 is predicted, while the maximum temperature ratio of Tch/Tcool = 4.099 yields a gain of |R|≈ 0.033. 5.02 Numerical Results Figure 7 shows the numerical results of this study. Considering harmonic excitation, simulations are run for sinusoidal incoming f-waves with frequency intervals of 25 Hz. The resulting resonator perfor- mance of this discrete excitation pattern is given by the colored squares. For the system-identiﬁcation, three randomly generated broadband simulations are run for each temperature ratio. The results of the identiﬁed system are given by the dashed lines. At an identiﬁcation time-length of 0.004 s, the very good agreement of the results for the three random broadband signals indicates the expected independence of the generated f-wave.

The comparison of the results derived from harmonic and broadband excitation shows very good agreement for all temperature ratios. Thus, in further studies the method of system identiﬁcation may be used to save computational costs. Finally, analytical and numerical (broadband excitation) results are compared in Fig. 8. Both trends driven by increasing temperature ratios - the shift of eigenfrequency and the maximum damping behavior - correspond for the analytical and the numerical approach. However, the gain of the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the numerical results are slightly lower then those of the analytical formulation. Furthermore, the eigenfrequencies predicted by the numerical approach is slightly higher. 6. Summary and Conclusions In this study, the damping behavior of quarter-wave resonators is investigated analytically and numer- ically. The focus lies on the consideration of temperature inhomogeneities, as they can be expected to occur in combustion chambers due to high temperature gradients between hot combustion gas and cooled ICSV 27, Annual Congress of International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIA V), Prague, 12-16 July 2020 A.2 Acoustic Impedance of a Quarter-Wave Resonator with Non-Uniform Temperature chamber walls. For the analytical approach, the resistance is modeled based an the work by Laudien et al. The reactance is given from a closed-form expression. Overall, an extended analytical model is presented accounting for axial temperature inhomogeneities within the resonator. A numerical framework is pre- sented as a more ﬂexible design tool without the requirement for semi-empirical correlations. The com- bined CFD/SI procedure is successfully validated against simulation results form harmonically excited simulations for several temperature proﬁles. The results of the analytical and the CFD/SI approach show good agreement. Both reveal a compa- rable increase in the maximum damping performance for rising temperature ratios as well as a shift in eigenfrequency. The results clearly underline that the mean temperature is not a sufﬁcient measure for the description of the damping characteristics. Instead, a more detailed knowledge of the temperature proﬁle is required for an accurate prediction of the acoustic behavior. For an a-priori known temperature proﬁle, the presented CFD/SI tool-chain can be used to generate highly accurate models with low numerical cost.

M¨unchen, Germany Email: vanburen@tfd.mw.tum.de ABSTRACT Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in viscous, laminar, single-phase, oscillatory chan- nel ﬂow is investigated in the present paper. Kurzweg (J. Heat Transf.107, 1985) analysed this case theoretically and derived a correlation for a non-dimensionalized effective ther- mal conductivity in terms of Prandtl and Womersley numbers. The present investigation contributes analysis of limiting cases and physical interpretation to the results of Kurzweg. A simpliﬁed model with isothermal walls is proposed, applicable if working ﬂuid and chan- nel wall material exhibit sufﬁciently large differences in thermal inertia. Examined over a wide range of Womersley numbers, this model reveals six distinct regimes characterized by the Prandtl number of the ﬂuid. The respective thickness of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers relative to the channel width is relevant in this context. Maximum effec- tive thermal conductivity is attained when the thermal boundary layer expands over the full channel width. The inﬂuence of Womersley number is discussed and explained in terms of the interplay of hydrodynamic and thermal ﬂow characteristics. These patterns reveal either quasi-steady parabolic or oscillating bulk characteristics. The importance of the ther- mal boundary layer thickness motivates the introduction of a new non-dimensional group, making it easier to classify the various regimes of enhanced longitudinal heat transfer. A.3 Enhanced Longitudinal Heat Transfer in Oscillatory Channel Flow. Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective INTRODUCTION Several authors report enhanced axial transport of passive scalars, such as contaminants, induced by oscillations in capillary tubes [1–4]. The reported enhanced transport exceeds purely molecular diffusion by orders of magnitude. The enhancement is attributed to the interaction between oscillating radial velocity proﬁles and local variations in concentration. Thus, an effective axial diffusion rate is formulated. Kurzweg and coworkers exploited the similarity between molecular diffusion and heat transfer when investigating heat transfer between two water reservoirs at different temperatures, connected by a bundle of capillary tubes. Inducing high-frequency velocity oscillations to the ﬂuid, heat transfer between the reservoirs increased by four orders of magnitude over the non- oscillating reference case, where heat conduction was the only mechanism of heat transfer. In a ﬁnal step, Kurzweg developed a comprehensive analytical model for the effective thermal diffu- sivity. Choosing a non-dimensional formulation, Kurzweg identiﬁed the Womersley number α, deﬁned as the ratio of transient inertial and viscous forces, as a key parameter and highlighted that effective diffusivity is reduced at large as well as small Womersley numbers. Maximum longitudi- nal heat transfer is reported to occur when the Prandtl number Pr satisﬁes the relation α2 Pr ≈π. Later studies evaluated theoretically and experimentally the so-called “dream pipe” – a capillary heat transfer tube bundle (e.g. Kaviany [8–10] and Nishio et al ). In contrast to the original work by Kurzweg, circular ducts instead of two-dimensional channels were considered. Inaba et al contributed to the understanding of the inﬂuence of the properties of the channel wall (i.e. its thermal conductivity and thickness). Puvaneswari and Shailendhra provided an ex- tended mathematical investigation that includes viscoelastic ﬂuids employed as the oscillating heat carriers. The challenging acoustic design of passive damping devices in rocket engines motivates the present work. Commonly used quarter-wave resonators are designed as capillary tubes and pre- vent catastrophic thermoacoustic instabilities. However, extreme thermal ﬂow conditions inside the combustion chamber complicate the design process. For example, turbulent pulsations trigger enhanced heat transfer between the hot combustion gas and regeneratively cooled walls. Reproduction of Papers Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective The resulting temperature gradients within the resonator strongly inﬂuence its acoustic proper- ties and thus jeopardize the sensitive acoustic stability of the engine. This theoretical investigation assumes an incompressible ﬂow to focus only on diffusive effects contributing to enhanced heat transfer. Heat pump effects induced by thermoacoustic density ﬂuctuations are neglected. Furthermore, evaporation of propellant is not considered. The reader should keep in mind the potential relevance of latent heat and liquid-vapor two-phase ﬂow (e.g. Miura et al ). The present study contributes to the understanding of the physical mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement in oscillating channel ﬂow: As a starting point, the next section outlines the model by Kurzweg and simpliﬁcations proposed by van Buren and Polifke. Then the present paper provides insight into three related problems: Firstly, the (mathematical) inﬂuence of Womersley and Prandtl number. Based on the simpliﬁed analytical model, six distinct characteristic regimes are identiﬁed. These regimes are connected to the limiting constellations of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. Secondly, the (physical) interplay of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. Based on the characteristics of the limiting thermal and hydrodynamic proﬁles (bulk vs. quasi-steady parabolic proﬁles), physical explanations for the quantitative scaling of the effective thermal diffusivity are derived for each regime. The wall-normal thermal penetration depth is revealed as a signiﬁcant key driver of the problem at hand. Thirdly, focusing on the interplay of boundary layers and the importance of thermal penetra- tion depth, a corresponding non-dimensional group is introduced, which is deﬁned as the ratio of transient thermal inertia and wall-normal conductive heat ﬂux. This novel non-dimensional group, which we name the “Kurzweg number” in acknowledgement of Kurzweg’s seminal analysis, underlines the importance of the thermal boundary layer: In ﬁve out of six constellations of bound- ary layers, the Kurzweg number sufﬁces to quantify the effective thermal conductivity (alongside with the Womersley number), which serves as a measure of enhanced longitudinal heat transfer (ELHT).

REVISITING THE LITERATURE Model by Kurzweg In 1985, Kurzweg presented a closed-form analytical expression for the effective longitudi- nal thermal diffusivity κe in oscillatory channel ﬂow. The two-dimensional ﬂuid channel (width 2 h) is conﬁned by solid walls (thickness 2 b) in span-wise z-direction (see Fig. 1, left). In the wall-normal direction, symmetry condition is applied at the center-line of the channel and at the center-line of each wall, considering a stack of parallel channels. In non-dimensional notation η = z/h, these symmetries are at η= 0 and η= ±ϵ, respectively, where the geometric wall-to-channel character- istic is deﬁned as ϵ≡(b+ h)/h. In stream-wise x-direction, the harmonically oscillating ﬂuid (e.g. forced by an oscillating pres- sure gradient) exhibits a velocity proﬁle U(η,t) described by: U(η,t) = U 0 f(η)eiωt = U 0 iλ α2 [ 1 −cosh( √ iαη) cosh( √ iα) ] eiωt, (1) where U 0 is a representative velocity, λthe non-dimensional pressure gradient, tthe time, and ω the angular frequency. The Womersley number α is deﬁned as the ratio of transient inertial and viscous forces: α2 ≡ ρωU µUh 2 = ωh 2 µρ−1 = ωh 2 ν, (2) Reproduction of Papers Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective where µ denotes the dynamic viscosity, ν the kinematic viscosity, and ρ the density of the ﬂuid. Under the assumption of temporal and stream-wise periodicity, Eqn. (1) is an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations (Stokes problem). The channel-averaged tidal replacement ∆x follows by the integration of Eqn. (1): ∆x= 2 U 0λ ωα2 ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐1 −tanh( √ iα)√ iα ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐. (3) Kurzweg accounts for conjugate heat transfer between the channel walls and the oscillat- ing ﬂuid. Within the walls, heat conduction is the only transport mechanism, whereas additional convective transport is considered within the ﬂuid. The effective thermal diffusivity κe is then deﬁned such that its product with the average stream-wise temperature gradient γ equals the time-averaged convective thermal ﬂux across the channel cross-sectional dimension with width η= 1 : κeγ = ω 2π ∫ 2π/ω ∫ 1 ℜ[T(x,η,t )] ℜ [ U 0 f(η)eiωt ] dηdt, (4) Kurzweg provides a solution of Eqn.

(7) Pr = ν/κf denotes the ﬂuid Prandtl number and the bar ¯·the complex conjugate of the functions h, j, and H. Non-dimensional characteristics describing the material properties (ﬂuid vs. solid) are the ratio of thermal conductivities ξ = kf/ks and the ratio of thermal diffusivities σ = κf/κs, respectively. Simpliﬁcations by van Buren and Polifke In a follow-up study, van Buren and Polifke introduced a simpliﬁcation that is valid for many technical applications: For conﬁgurations with thick walls compared to the channel width (b≫h), the geometric characteristic ϵsimpliﬁes: b≫h ⇒ ϵ≫1. (8) Furthermore, if the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid kf (e.g. air) is much smaller than the ther- mal conductivity of the solid ks (e.g. metal), kf ≪ks, the thermal material characteristic ξ ap- proaches zero: kf ≪ks ⇒ ξ≈0. (9) Physically speaking, these assumptions imply time-invariant temperatures at the ﬂuid-solid interface. Thereby, the applied assumptions coincide with parametric set-up of maximum heat transfer concluded by Inaba et al. As depicted in Fig. 1 (right) and shown in, the stream-wise temperature gradient γ is maintained spatially and temporally constant. Exploiting Reproduction of Papers Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective the simpliﬁcations which these assumptions allow (i.e. H →1/Pr), Eqn.

(10) In the present study, this simpliﬁed expression serves as the starting point for a comprehensive discussion of the interplay between hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. In this process, ﬁndings by Kurzweg are conﬁrmed, expanded, and interpreted in a physical context. DISCUSSION OF THE SIMPLIFIED MODEL Inﬂuence of Womersley and Prandtl number In this section, observations of the inﬂuence of Womersley and Prandtl number on the effec- tive thermal diffusivity are categorized and discussed. In this context, three central ﬁndings of Kurzweg regarding the non-dimensional effective thermal diffusivity κe/(ω∆x 2) are conﬁrmed, namely: (i) For large Womersley numbersα, thermal diffusivity is proportional to 1/α. (ii) For small α, thermal diffusivity is proportional to α2. (iii) There is a maximum in thermal diffusivity close to α2 Pr = π. In the following, these ﬁndings are expanded and discussed in a physical context. First, Eqn.

The purely real-valued denominator is factored out and rearranged (Ψ). The difference between Φ and Θ remains. To drop the imaginary part attributed to the functions ofh(α) and j(Pr,α), rewriting leads to a generalized function g(ζ). The argument of the function g is either the Womersley number (see Φ) or a combination of Womersley and Prandtl number (see Θ). Figure 2 displays the individual terms of Eqn. (11) vs. the Womersley number α for a small (left side, Pr = 0.01) and a large Prandtl number (right side, Pr = 100 ), ﬂuid characteristics that are representative of liquid metal and viscous oils, respectively. At ambient condition, the Prandtl numbers of ﬂuids such as water ( Pr ≈10) or air ( Pr ≈0.07) lie well inside this range. The red dotted vertical line marks the maximum of ELHT at α = √ π/Pr, already observed by Kurzweg. The black dotted line denotes α= √π. At this value of α, hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness δ(also known as Stokes boundary layer) and channel width hare of the same order of magnitude because: δ= √ 2ν/ω ⇒ δ h = √ α.

Conversely, for α >√π (e.g. acoustic quarter-wave resonators), the pre-factor |Ψ|scales with 1/α ( 2 a and 3 ). Thus, these slopes are attributed to the hydrodynamic boundary layer either extending over the full channel width or being conﬁned to the close vicinity of the wall (black dotted line). At α = √ π/Pr (red dotted line), no change in slopes occurs. The second row of Fig. 2 showsΦ and Θ. Originating from the function g(ζ), the scaling of both terms changes from α3 to α0 as the argument ζ approaches ζ ≈√π. For Φ, the argument of g(ζ) is the Womersley numberα, thus being related to the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness. On the other hand, Θ relates ζ = α √ Pr. In this context, the thermal boundary layer thickness δth is the thermal analog of the Stokes boundary layer thickness and reads: δth = √ 2κ/ω ⇒ δth h = √ α √ Pr. (14) It directly shows that Θ is connected to the spatial extent of thermal penetration (red dotted line). In addition to the ﬁndings of Kurzweg, the difference between Φ and Θ reveals a third regime 2 of Womersley numbers with constant scaling. The placement of this range depends on the Prandtl number Pr being smaller or larger than unity. Physically speaking, this indicates that the thermal boundary layerδth already extends over the full channel width, while the hydrodynamic boundary layer δis wall-conﬁned (2 a, Pr <1), or vice versa (2 b ). A.3 Enhanced Longitudinal Heat Transfer in Oscillatory Channel Flow. Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective The bottom row of Fig. 2 shows the effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2) as calculated by the three individual terms of Eqn. (11). As reported by Kurzweg, the maximum lies at α ≈ √ π/Pr. Interestingly, the reported third regime 2 a vanishes for Pr < 1 (i.e. it shows the same characteristics as regime 1 ). However, for Pr >1, this additional regime 2 b persists and scales with the inverse square of the Womersley number 1/α2. Table 1 summarizes the results. Interplay of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers In this section, the physical interplay of velocity and temperature proﬁle is discussed and in- terpreted in terms of the resulting effective thermal conductivity κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2). As presented in the previous section, each of the six possible combinations of Womersley and Prandtl number ( 1 – 3 and a – b ) are categorized in Tab. 2. In favor of a comprehensible presentation, the variation of the Womersley number αis illustrated by adjusting the channel width. In all plots of Tab. 2, this approach is depicted by two channel realizations of increasing width h in the z-direction, where the vertical dashed lines denote the shifting conﬁning wall. Meanwhile, the angular frequency ω and the ﬂuid viscosity ν are constant. Firstly and referring to Tab. 2, the reader is reminded of the two distinct proﬁle characteristics that an oscillating channel ﬂow exhibits in its limiting cases: At small channel width h ( 1 ), a quasi-steady parabolic velocity proﬁle U(z) exists across the ﬂow channel. Thus, the magnitude of velocity ﬂuctuations scales with the square of the channel width h. For the opposite case of large channel width h( 3 ), hydrodynamic boundary layers are conﬁned to the close vicinity of the wall. In this case, the channel width does not affect the magnitude of velocity ﬂuctuations. Figure 3 sketches the parabolic (blue line) and bulk limit (orange line), respectively. In a second step, the temperature ﬂuctuations T′(z) are quantiﬁed. In analogy to the velocity proﬁle, the channel widthhdistinguishes between quasi-steady parabolic and bulk characteristics. However, the thermal threshold lies at δth/h ≈ √ 2/(πPr). As elaborated in the previous section, the Prandtl number classiﬁes constellations of only one boundary layer (hydrodynamic or thermal) expanding into the center of the channel ( 2 ). Furthermore, the temperature proﬁle is directly linked to the velocity proﬁle: the driving wall-normal temperature disturbances are induced by the stream-wise tidal ﬂuid displacement.

Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective Parabolic proﬁle Bulk proﬁle δ/h≪1 δ/h≫1 Fig. 3. Characteristic limiting velocity proﬁles of an oscillating channel ﬂow: parabolic ( ) and bulk proﬁle ( ). Alongside each temperature plot in Tab. 2, the corresponding value of thermal diffusivity is given. The convective heat ﬂux Q yields the integral spatial product of velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations over the channel cross-section. The effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e corresponds to Eqn. (4). In its non-dimensional form κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2), the tidal displacement ∆xis incorporated. In the present paper, the procedure is exemplarily presented for the regimes 1 a and 3 b : Regime 1 a is deﬁned by α2 ≪π and thus develops a parabolic velocity proﬁle. This implies a velocity difference U between the walls and the center of the channel, scaling proportionally with the square of the channel width h: U ∼h 2. The above velocity difference now acts as the triggering temperature disturbance: The ﬂuid at the wall is at rest, whereas, in the center of the channel, the adjoining hot/cold ﬂuid ﬂows in at the velocity U. Furthermore, the thermal penetration is much larger than the channel width in regime 1 a (α2 Pr ≪π). In consequence, also a parabolic temperature proﬁle develops throughout the channel. The wall-induced temperature disturbance T′scales with the triggering velocity disturbance over the channel width: T′∼Udz 2 ∼h 4. In the next step, the heat ﬂux Qfollows from the temperature disturbances T′convected by the velocity U over the channel width: Q∼UT′dz∼h 7 ∼α7 (with α∼h, only the channel width his changed in this set-up). The effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e follows as the averaged heat ﬂux Q over the channel width h: κ⋆ e ∼Q/h∼α6. Finally, the tidal displacement ∆xis proportional to the square of the channel width h 2 (compare Eqn. (3)), and thus the non-dimensional scaling for the effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2) reads κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2) ∼α2. Reproduction of Papers Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective Regime 3 b is deﬁned by α2 ≫π and thus develops a bulk velocity proﬁle. In this case, the velocity U in the center of the channel does not depend on the channel width h but is constant. Derivations from this velocity U are restricted to the very thin hydrodynamic boundary layer close to the wall, and temperature disturbances are limited to the even smaller thermal boundary layer (Pr ≫1). As temperature disturbances T′are triggered by the constant velocity ﬂuctuation, they are also constant and do not change with the channel width h. Analog to the previous example, the heat ﬂux Qresults from the convective transport of temperature disturbances over the channel width. However, this effect is restricted to the constant boundary layer thickness in the present regime: Q∼UT′dz ∼const. The effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e follows as the averaged heat ﬂux Qover the channel width h: κ⋆ e ∼Q/h∼1/α. Finally, the tidal displacement ∆xdoes not depend on the channel width h 2 (compare Eqn. (3)), and thus the non-dimensional scaling for the effective thermal diffusivity κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2) reads κ⋆ e/(ω∆x 2) ∼α2. For all six regimes, results match previous ﬁndings and underline the importance of interplay between hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. A more comprehensible picture is provided by the evaluation of effective thermal diffusivity vs. both Womersley and Prandtl number in Fig. 4. The three coloured solid lines on the surface-plot (orange: α = √π, black: Pr = 1, and blue α2 Pr = π) represent the three thresholds and deﬁne the six regimes. The colored bottom of the plot further clariﬁes the parabolic or bulk characteristics of the hydrodynamic and thermal proﬁle: Blue indicates regions of parabolic proﬁles (i.e. large boundary layers), whereas orange indicates bulk proﬁles (i.e. small boundary layers). The hatched area corresponds to Pr < 1 and describes larger thermal boundary layers compared to its hydrodynamic counterpart. The six green lines indicate each parameter range evaluated in Fig. 2 and Tabs. 1 and 2. Again, the maximum appears for parameter combinations that yielα2 Pr = π(e.g. compare with the blue line in Fig. 4). As derived above (e.g. in Eq. 14), such conditions correspond to channel ﬂows where the thermal penetration depth approaches the center of the channel. Thus, transient temperature ﬂuctuations (driven by wall-normal ﬂuid-to-wall heat exchange) occur within the complete cross- sectional area of the channel. In particular in the center of the channel, where velocity oscillations are large, the interplay of thermal and hydrodynamic oscillations drives the maximum convective A.3 Enhanced Longitudinal Heat Transfer in Oscillatory Channel Flow.

The next section builds on this physically explanation and motivates the introduction of the Kurzweg number. INTRODUCTION OF THE KURZWEG NUMBER The Womersley number αyields the ratio of transient inertial and viscous force. The present paper proposes an analogous deﬁnition of a non-dimensional Kurzweg number Ku as the ratio of thermal inertia and conductive heat ﬂux: Ku 2 ≡ ρcωT kf Th 2 = ωh κf = ωh ν Pr = α2 Pr, (15) where ρis the density andcthe speciﬁc heat capacity of the ﬂuid. This deﬁnition allows to estimate the thermal penetration depth δth solely in terms of the Kurzweg number as: δth h = √ Ku.

(17) Notice Φ⋆ and Θ⋆, which are of identical form, only depending on the proﬁle of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer thickness, respectively. Figure 5 reveals that the presentation in terms of Womersley and Kurzweg (instead of Prandlt) numbers simpliﬁes the physical interpretation: In ﬁve out of six regimes, the effective thermal diffusivity is governed solely by the Kurzweg number, which represents the thermal boundary layer thickness. The exception is regime ( 3 b ), which is characterized by bulk velocity proﬁles in combination with thermal boundary layers conﬁned to the very close vicinity of the wall ( δth < δ). In this case, the Womersley number αalso has an inﬂuence on the longitudinal heat transfer. CONCLUSIONS The present study provides a comprehensive discussion of effective longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow. The analysis is based on the framework by Kurzweg and simpliﬁca- tions proposed in. Qualitative evaluation of limiting cases reported by Kurzweg is conﬁrmed and discussed in the context of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer characteristics. Combi- nations of boundary layer conﬁgurations reveal six possible setups of either disturbance extending throughout the complete channel cross-section or not. The maximum in effective thermal diffusivity is physically attributed to the thermal boundary layer thickness approaching the center of the channel when large temperature ﬂuctuations prevail over the majority of the cross-section. This empathizes the importance of the thermal penetration depth, which is directly incorporated in the proposed deﬁnition of a Kurzweg number Ku. The adjusted formulation expands on the physical interpretability as it provides a decoupled treatment A.3 Enhanced Longitudinal Heat Transfer in Oscillatory Channel Flow. Enhanced longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow – a theoretical perspective of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers. The novel representation shows that in ﬁve out of six regimes, the Womersley number has no impact on the effective thermal conductivity. However, only the thermal penetration (presented by the Kurzweg number) affects the problem at hand.

München, Germany article info Article history: Received 29 April 2019 Received in revised form 19 July 2019 Accepted 14 August 2019 Keywords: Enhanced convective heat transfer Turbulent channel ﬂow High amplitude pulsation Large eddy simulation (LES) abstract Heat transfer in pulsatile turbulent channel ﬂow is investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation. Incompressible ﬂow within a periodic computational domain is driven by a pulsating axial pressure gra- dient at a turbulent Reynolds number of Res ¼ 350. A localized dynamic sub-grid scale approach is cho- sen to model unclosed stress terms. A layer-averaged sub-grid model determines turbulent Prandtl numbers that depend on wall distance. Compared to the existing literature, a much wider range of oscil- lation parameters is studied. In particular, forcing frequencies correspond to Womersley numbers from Wo ¼ 14 to 70, while forcing amplitudes reach values that result in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal, i.e. reverse ﬂow velocities up to ﬁve times larger than the mean ﬂow velocity. At moderate pulsation amplitudes, i.e. in the range of emerging ﬂow reversal, strong deviations of instantaneous heat transfer rates from the temporal mean are observed. Particularly at times of ﬂow reversal, an increase in heat transfer up to 60% above non-pulsatile values is observed. However, when averaging over a complete cycle, any enhancement in mean heat transfer is only minor. On the other hand, simulations at larger pulsations amplitudes that result in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal, show a enhancement of mean heat transfer in excess of 100%. Note that such signiﬁcant enhancement of heat transfer has not been reported previously in Large Eddy Simulation of turbulent pulsatile ﬂow. The paper offers a physical interpretation of the results and concludes that an overall increase in turbulent transport is responsible for the observed signiﬁcant enhancement of convective heat transfer. /C 2112019 Elsevier Ltd.

In extreme cases, the reported enhancement reached levels that compromise the thermal integrity of devices suffering from thermoacoustic instabilities. One speciﬁc example for such devices is a rocket engine combustion chamber. Exceeding the designed wall heat ﬂux may obviously endanger a secure operation with possibly catastrophic consequences. Therefore, the reliable prediction of heat transfer in turbulent pulsating ﬂows is crucial for a comprehensive design process of combustion chambers. For the case of rocket motors, Harrje et al give an overview of observed incidents and report that under representative condi- tions, unstable operation does not permit reliable measurements, such that eventually only a severe hardware damage can be attested. Harrje cautions that due to the aggressive conditions in the chambers, most of the experimental information is limited and of rather qualitative nature. Nevertheless, in a ﬁnal report, Harrje concludes that the heat transfer under periodic unsteady conditions can exceed its steady state value by more than 100% and that ﬂow reversal, prevalent in the vicinity of a velocity anti-node, plays a decisive role. Due to the wide range of perturbation frequencies and mean ﬂow Reynolds numbers used in the various investigations, appar- ently contradictory arguments can be found in the literature, with both enhancement and decrease of heat transfer being reported. In a laboratory scale, Perry and Culick studied the average heat transfer in a solid propellant T-burner that exhibited combus- tion instabilities. In the presence of combustion-driven oscillation, enhanced heat transfer (EHT) proportional to the square root of the oscillation amplitudes and the fourth root of the frequency was found. Dec and co-workers studied the phenomenon in a pulse com- bustor, which was operated in limit cycle over a range of frequen- cies and amplitudes that included ﬂow reversal. In a series of papers [5–8], local heat transfer enhancement by up to 300% was https://doi.org/10.01016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.0118585 0017-9310//C 2112019 Elsevier Ltd.

The novelty compared to previous investigations was that detailed measurements of velocity, temperature, and heat ﬂux rates were performed. The investigations put forward the hypoth- esis that a combination of increased turbulence in the shear layer and strong convection, driven by transverse ﬂows at times of ﬂow reversal, is responsible for enhanced heat transfer. However, it was not possible to elucidate the mechanism that leads to said trans- verse ﬂows. Habib et al, when studying heat transfer at various pulsa- tion frequencies in laminar pulsating pipe ﬂow, encountered increased as well as reduced Nusselt numbers, and established that the effects are primarily present in the thermally developing region. However, the magnitude of the enhancement was far smal- ler than in the above mentioned turbulent cases. Hemida et al attempted to clarify these issues with a the- oretical analysis of heat transfer in laminar pulsating ﬂow in a tube with constant wall heat ﬂux. They found that the local Nusselt number exhibits a spatial modulation along the tube with values both higher and lower than in the stationary case. The perturba- tions are most pronounced in the thermally developing region and are damped out further downstream. However, the amplitudes imposed in the studies of Hemida et al are restricted to pul- sating ﬂow without center-line ﬂow reversal. In an analytical study, Lundgren et al resolved ﬂow and heat transfer in laminar, pulsating ﬂows in channel conﬁgurations, including pipe ﬂow. The consideration of an oscillating axial tem- perature is the most important novelty of their study. Furthermore, they considered large amplitudes with center-line ﬂow reversal. A fully developed ﬂow ﬁeld was assumed, pressure and velocity gra- dients in the axial direction that oscillated harmonically in time were imposed. Qualitatively, their results match the behavior of the experiments performed by Dec et al[5–8] well, displaying second harmonics in the channel bulk temperature modulation. However, the results cannot be compared quantitatively, because of the absence of turbulent scales. Nevertheless, the study also demonstrates the possibility of both enhanced and decreased heat transfer, depending on the relative phase between temperature and velocity ﬂuctuations. Numerical studies based on computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) give detailed insight into transient phenomena, also for the pertinent case of turbulent pulsating ﬂows. Thyageswaran simulated the turbulent ﬂow in a pulse combustor tail pipe and reproduced the high heat transfer rates reported by Dec et al [5–8]. In order to resolve the tail pipe domain in its entirety, Thya- geswaran’s simulations employed unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence models and wall models. Well established wall models failed to reproduce correctly the transient behavior of the heat transfer, thus a modiﬁed model was proposed, which reproduced the higher heat transfer rates at least qualita- tively. Unfortunately, this formulation does not give insight into the mechanisms leading to the enhancement. Scotti and Piomelli studied momentum transfer, in par- ticular wall shear stress, in pulsating channel ﬂow by means of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and RANS. It was demonstrated that conventional RANS models fail to properly predict the ﬂow dynamics in this case.

Furthermore, it was shown that dynamic sub-grid scale models, which can be considered as state of the art in LES mod- elling, are capable of modeling accurately the unclosed terms also in transient cases. In this context, it is important that the near wall region is fully resolved, making the necessity of dynamically adapted coefﬁcients evident. The studies of Scotti and Piomelli were restricted to incompressible ﬂow without heat transfer and focused on near wall momentum transfer. It was observed that the ﬂuctuations in the near wall region generated by the pulsating pressure gradient do not propagate beyond a characteristic dis- tance. The so-called turbulent Stokes length was estimated using the sum of the molecular and turbulent diffusivities. Wang and Lu employed LES based on the dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model to study turbulent structures and passive heat transfer in turbulent pulsating ﬂow between par- allel plates. The inﬂuence of the Prandtl number at a turbulent Rey- nolds number of Res ¼ 350 on the thermal response of the ﬂow was investigated. The results conﬁrmed that for high Prandtl num- bers the temperature ﬂuctuations and the mechanisms involved in the heat transfer process are conﬁned to a very thin region close to the wall. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the organized pulsations on the time average quantities (in particular heat transfer) was found to be marginal for the conditions investigated, which did not exhi- bit center-line ﬂow reversal. Wang and Zhang examined heat transfer in a two- dimensional duct, applying unsteady RANS equations. In distinc- tion to the prior studies, instead of cyclic boundary conditions a long inlet region was applied. The investigation of Wang and Zhang extends to large pulsation amplitudes with strongly pro- nounced ﬂow reversal. Amplitudes reached up to six times the mean ﬂow velocity and large pulsation amplitudes greatly pro- moted the time-averaged heat transfer. An optimum Womersley number was connected to the enhancement. Note that this approach conﬂicts with the conclusions of Scotti and Piomelli who argue that RANS simulations are not adequate for the problem at hand. Cardenas performed a computational study with focus on the effect of enhancement of heat transfer in turbulent acoustic channel ﬂows. Lower Reynolds numbers (Res ¼ 180) than in the works of Scotti and Piomelli and Wang and Lu were inves- tigated. For pulsation amplitudes approaching ﬂow reversal, a slight enhancement of heat transfer was found at pressure nodes (less than 10%). Effects of acoustic impedance, i.e. the relative amplitude and phase of pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations, were investigated as possible causes for the discrepancies from experi- mental studies. Thus, the study extends to a weakly compressible formulation to account for positions away from the pressure node. In summarizing the literature review on heat transfer in pulsat- ing ﬂows (compare Table 1), it is noted that, with the exception of for Wang and Zhang, all studies that report signiﬁcant enhancement of heat transfer are of experimental nature, with pul- sations driven by acoustic waves. The experimentally observed magnitudes of heat transfer enhancement were not consistently reproduced or convincingly explained by the numerical and theo- retical studies. In other words, although strong evidence of enhanced heat transfer in pulsating ﬂow has been presented, a fully satisfactory explanation of the responsible mechanisms remains as elusive as quantitative predictions. Thus additional fun- damental research in this area is necessary. The present paper aims to offer physical interpretation for sig- niﬁcant heat transfer enhancement in pulsatile turbulent channel ﬂow. Note that such signiﬁcant enhancement of heat transfer has not been reported previously in Large Eddy Simulation. Compared to the existing literature, a considerably wider range of parameters is studied. In particular, forcing frequencies correspond to Womer- sley numbers from 14 to 70, while forcing amplitudes reach values that result in strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal, i.e. reverse ﬂow velocities up to ﬁve times larger than the mean ﬂow velocity. Based on highly resolved LES, the investigation of pulsating ﬂow ﬁelds is carried out at Reynolds number Res ¼ 350. Fully developed intrin- sic turbulence spectra are generated by the imposed mean axial pressure gradient combined with cyclic boundary conditions. For the closure of unresolved terms, dynamic localized approaches, accounting for partly unsteady ﬂow characteristics, are carefully selected. Data-reduction, obtained by a variety of runtime averag- ing operations, allows for meaningful interpretation of the results. The turbulent kinetic energy is identiﬁed as an important charac- teristic. In current dominated ﬂows without ﬂow reversal, relami- narization and its effect on EHT are discussed. The extensive physical interpretation of prevailing ﬂow characteristics provides novel insight in the interaction of turbulence and heat transfer. Arguments are given why signiﬁcant EHT was not reported in prior numerical LES studies, but only in experimental investigations. To close this gap, the range of pulsation amplitudes is extended to val- ues signiﬁcantly larger than those of previous numerical and theo- retical studies. Cases of strong ﬂow reversal with pulsation amplitudes up to ﬁve times the mean ﬂow velocity are investigated. The present study is structured as follows: Section 2.01 describes the set-up of the cyclic simulation domain which is then linked to the acoustically compact region of a pressure node in Section 2.02. The governing equations of the LES are stated in Section 2.03 and closed by the turbulence model (Section 2.04). Details on the methods of data reduction for the evaluation of the numerical experiments (Section 2.07) are presented in Section 2.05. Non- dimensional characteristics are introduced in Section 2.06. The results of the numerical study are presented as follows: First, a validation case is studied in Section 3. A more detailed investigation of relaminarization of pulsating ﬂows in the range of emerging ﬂow reversal follows (Section 4).

Simulation domain setup To provide a fundamental analysis of heat and momentum transfer in turbulent, pulsating ﬂow driven by an acoustic ﬁeld, a channel ﬂow conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1 with cyclic boundary conditions in the stream-wise and span-wise directions has been chosen. The ﬂow is driven by an imposed momentum source term S! mom, which overcomes viscous losses at the walls and emulates the pulsating acoustic pressure gradients that drive the pulsations. The major advantage of this conﬁguration is that it affords high resolution of the turbulent ﬂow without the requirement of an inﬂow turbulence model. Once the ﬂow is fully developed, the tur- bulent structures do not depend on initial or boundary conditions, but are inherently driven by the near wall turbulence production, resulting in a realistic turbulence spectrum. Note that the present setup is not suitable for hydrodynamically or thermally developing ﬂows, cf. the studies of Habib et al and Hemida et al. The channel half heighth is the characteristic geometry length scale. Non-slip conditions are imposed at the top and bottom walls. In order to capture large turbulent structures, the domain extends Lx ¼ 2 ph in the stream-wise and Ly ¼ ph in the span-wise direc- tion. Furthermore, to induce heat transfer, the top and bottom walls are kept at different temperatures Tl and Tu, respectively. Conjugate heat transfer is not considered in the analysis and thus, Dirichlet boundary conditions are employed. This approach is jus- tiﬁed by the results of Emmert et al, who argued that a wall of ﬁnite thickness does not contribute to EHT. Fluid properties are assumed to be constant for low differences in temperature. It is pointed out that the presented setup of the simulation domain is well documented in the literature which thus allows comprehensive validation (e.g. ). Most of the earlier studies focus on incompressible pulsating ﬂows and do not link to acoustics as the driving mechanism. However, as will be shown in the next section, regions of acoustic pressure nodes physically coincide with such pulsating ﬂows. In the context of EHT, the local- ized investigation in the vicinity of pressure nodes agrees with numerous experimental studies ([1,2,4–8]) that identify the large velocity ﬂuctuations as a main driving mechanism. In the following section, the link to an acoustically driven, tur- bulent, pulsating channel ﬂow is given by the derivation of the imposed momentum source term S! mom. 2.02. Acoustically compact properties derived from duct acoustics Consider a one-dimensional acoustic ﬁeld in an closed channel of length L and small transverse dimensions. From linear theory, the mode shape of the second harmonic reads: p 0 q 0 c 0 x; tðÞ ¼ 2 A cos 2 px=LðÞ cos xtðÞ ¼ ap xðÞ cos xtðÞ; ð1Þ u 0 x; tðÞ ¼ /C 0 2 A sin 2 px=LðÞ sin xtðÞ ¼ au xðÞ sin xtðÞ; ð2Þ where A is a constant deﬁning the magnitude of the sound pressure level. Small Mach numbers Ma/C 28 1 are assumed such that the inﬂu- ence of mean ﬂow on the acoustic wave propagation can be neglected. Fig. 2 shows schematically the amplitudesp 0 and u 0 of the velocity and pressure waves along the channel. The alternation between pressure and velocity nodes in periods of L=4 is evident. If the location X þ ph is placed on a pressure node, the velocity ﬂuc- tuates with maximum amplitude, while the pressure remains constant. If acoustic waves are present in turbulent channel ﬂow, one distinguishes between several contributions to the mean and ﬂuctuating ﬂow variables, which are characterized by respective velocity and length scales of considerably different magnitudes: acoustic perturbations u 0 and p 0 propagate at the speed of sound; at low frequencies only plane waves can propagate along the channel length L, with wave lengths much larger than the chan- nel height h. Turbulent perturbations u 00 and p 00 are transported through the domain at velocities similar to the reference ﬂow velocity, their length scales are a fraction of the channel half height h. Underlying these contributions is a constant, uniform mean pressure gradient dp 0=dx ¼ const. which drives the mean ﬂow. A triple-decomposition can be formulated, which for pres- sure reads p ¼ p 0 xðÞ þ p 0 x; tðÞ þ p 00 x! t /C 16/C 17 : ð3Þ As indicated in Eq.(3) and Fig. 2, which shows the axial distri- bution of mean pressurep 0 and acoustic pressurep 0 at an instant time t, the oscillating acoustic component p 0 x! t /C 16/C 17 is non- uniform in space. However, if the computational domain – denoted by the dashed box in Fig. 2–i sacoustically compact, i.e. if its length 2 ph is much less than the acoustic wavelength L, the acoustic pres- sure gradient may be treated as approximately uniform in space. The characteristic dimensionless group in this context is the Helm- holtz number He/C 17 x 2 ph=c 0, based on the frequencyx, speed of sound c 0 and domain length Lx ¼ 2 ph. A compact domain implies that He/C 28 1. In the limit of acoustic compactness, the ﬂow forcing by the mean and acoustic pressure gradients can be represented by a momentum source term that is uniform within the computational domain, Fig. 1.

LES governing equations The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach has proven its capa- bility to simulate turbulent pulsating ﬂows in several studies, especially if so-calleddynamic models (see Section 2.04) are used. The spatial ﬁltering of the discrete mesh can be expressed as the convolution of the primitive variablew with a grid dependentﬁlter function G x!/C 16/C 17. Several ﬁlter or kernel functions G in both spectral or physical space exist, which depend on the grid scale ﬁlter/C 22 D. Applying the ﬁlter function, the primitive variables are decom- posed into a resolved orgrid scale, and an unresolved orsubgrid scale (SGS) contribution, respectively: w ¼ /C 22 w þ wsgs: ð5Þ For low Mach numbers and small temperature differences, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with constant properties – in particular constant densityq 0 – are appropriate. For this case, the ﬁltered balance equations for mass, momentum and energy can be written as: @/C 22 ui @xi ¼ 0; ð6Þ @/C 22 ui @t þ @ @xj /C 22 ui /C 22 uj /C 0/C 1 ¼/C 0 1 q 0 @/C 22 p @xi þ m @2 /C 22 ui @xj@xj /C 0 @sij @xj þ 1 q 0 S! mom; ð7Þ @T @t þ @ @xj /C 22 uj T /C 0/C 1 ¼ m Pr @2 T @xj@xj /C 0 @qj @xj; ð8Þ where m denotes the kinematic viscosity and Pr the Prandtl number. The subgrid scale stress tensorsij is deﬁned assij ¼ uiuj /C 0 /C 22 ui /C 22 uj. The temperature is considered as a passive scalar and the ﬁl- tered diffusion ﬂux is closed by a gradient diffusion model. Analo- gously tosij, the unresolved heat ﬂuxqj of the scalar temperature T reads qj ¼ uj T /C 0 /C 22 uj T. Closure of the unresolved terms, which result from the sub-grid scales, is archived with two localized methods. The momentum equation is closed by a method proposed by Kim and Menon. For the energy equation, a gradient approach suggested by Moin et al is applied in a layer-averaged form to increase numerical stability. These two dynamic methods are described in the following. 2.04. LES turbulence model A localized one-equation model describes the unresolved kinetic energyksgs by the transport equation @ksgs @t þ /C 22 ui @ksgs @xi ¼/C 0 sij @/C 22 ui @xj /C 0 /C 15 dis þ @ @xi msgs @ksgs @xi /C 18/C 19; ð9Þ where msgs denotes the turbulent eddy viscosity at sub-grid scale. The terms that describe the change rate of the subgrid kinetic energyksgs are convection, production, dissipation and diffusion. The unresolved stress tensorsij is modeled via the subgrid scale eddy viscositymsgs: sij ¼/C 0 2 msgs þ 2 3 dijksgs; ð10Þ where msgs ¼ cv /C 22 D ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ksgs q : ð11Þ Finally, the model is closed by scaling the dissipation rate/C 15 dis: /C 15 dis ¼ c/C 15 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ksgs p /C 22 D : ð12Þ The coefﬁcients cv and c/C 15 are determined following a dynamic approach supposed by Kim and Menon. It is based on scale similarity assumptions and the application of a least square method leads to a signiﬁcant reduction of computational costs. The simplefilter implementation of Open FOAM is used where the test ﬁlter width is twice the grid ﬁlter. For a detailed description of the numerical implementation, please consult. The unresolved heat ﬂuxqj is modeled as qj ¼ msgs Prsgs @T @xj ð13Þ where Prsgs denotes the turbulent Prandtl number. The dynamic determination of the turbulent Prandtl number follows the approach suggested by Germano et al. Subsequently, the least square method was applied by Lilly. Detailed information of the layer-based, spatially averaged numerical implementation are provided by Moin et al, Wang and Lu as well as by Morar. At this point, it is emphasized that Scotti and Piomelli as well as Wang and Lu applied the dynamic Smagorinsky model, which assumes local equilibrium at all times. In accordance with Cardenas, the present study judiciously applies the kinetic energy equation model to consider partly unsteady characteristics induced by pulsations. 2.05. Data reduction through averaging operators For the meaningful characterization of turbulent pulsating ﬂows, data reduction through averaging is required. Due to the mesh resolution under consideration and in order to reduce stor- age requirements, the reduction takes place during simulation runtime. The temporal averaging of a quantityw x! t /C 16/C 17 over a total time ttot will be denoted by the hat operator (^/C 1 ) and is deﬁned as: ^w x!/C 16/C 17 ¼ 1 ttot Z ttot w x! t /C 16/C 17 dt: ð14Þ Exploiting the geometrical invariance in stream-wise and span- wise direction of the simulation domain, an additional spatial aver- aging of planes parallel to the top and bottom walls is introduced for further reduction and the increase of statistical validity. This combination of temporal and spatial averaging operations will be denoted by angle brackets: whi zðÞ ¼ 1 ttot Lx Ly Z Lx Z Ly Z ttot w x! t /C 16/C 17 dt dy dx : ð15Þ When dealing with pulsating ﬂows driven at a single frequency f ¼ 2 px, phase or ensemble averaging can help in the identiﬁcation of coherent structures. As argued by Scotti and Piomelli, this assumes that the major contribution of the system response occurs at the forcing frequency. This kind of operation will be denoted by subscripted angle brackets /C 10/C 11 p and is deﬁned as: whi p z; uðÞ ¼ 1 Nt Lx Ly XNt j¼1 Z Lx Z Ly w x! u x þ 2 p j /C 0 1ðÞ x /C 18/C 19 dy dx; ð16Þ S. van Buren et al / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 144 118585 5 Reproduction of Papers where Nt denotes the number of cycles under consideration and u 2 0; 2 p½Þ is the phase angle. The phase averaged quantities can be further decomposed into a mean, a harmonic and a non-linear component as proposed in: whi p z; uðÞ ¼ whi zðÞ þ aw zðÞ cos u þ /w zðÞ /C 0/C 1 þ wha z; uðÞ : ð17Þ Of course, the stationary component corresponds to the tempo- ral and spatial average of the original quantity. The harmonic com- ponent can be seen as a real valued amplitude, and thus may exhibit a phase lag/w towards a reference value. Note that both amplitude and phase lag are in general functions of the wall dis- tance. Usually, the phase lag is deﬁned using the axial velocity pul- sations at the channel center-line as reference. From the phase averaging deﬁnition, the oscillating component accounts only for the contribution of the forcing frequency. The contributions at higher harmonics are all added up in the termwha which is of course a function of the phaseu and the wall normal locationz. For the pulsating channel ﬂow, atriple decomposition into aver- age, acoustic and turbulent contributions widely used in the liter- ature can be written in terms of the average operators just introduced as: w x! t /C 16/C 17 ¼ whi þ aw zðÞ cos xt þ /w zðÞ /C 0/C 1 þ w 00 x! t /C 16/C 17; ð18Þ where w 00 denotes the turbulent ﬂuctuations and higher harmonics wha are omitted for simplicity. 2.06. Non-dimensional characterization of turbulent pulsating ﬂows For steady turbulent channel ﬂows, the stream-wise pressure gradient p 0;x is in equilibrium with the wall friction sw ¼ m@u=@zjz¼w, where the indexw denotes the wall-plane. Deﬁn- ing the friction velocity asus ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ sw=q p ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ hp 0;x=q q and the non- dimension wall distance z þ ¼ zus=m, the turbulent Reynolds number yields: Res ¼ hus m ¼ h m ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ hp 0;x q s : ð19Þ The Womersley number Wo is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile ﬂow frequency in relation to viscous effects: Wo ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ xh m s : ð20Þ The Nusselt number characterizes heat transfer and can be inter- preted as the non-dimensional temperature gradient at the wall: Nu ¼ qw DTb h Pr mqcp ¼ h DTb @T @z /C 12/C 12/C 12/C 12 w; ð21Þ where qw is the heat ﬂux at the wall and DTb the temperature dif- ference of bulk and wall temperature. Due to symmetry of the prob- lem at hand,DTb ¼ Tl /C 0 TuðÞ =2 holds. To account for unsteadiness, Ramaprian and Tu found the Stokes number to be insufﬁcient in turbulent pulsating ﬂows: Comparing time scales of diffusion driven penetrations, they found that effective diffusion may be signiﬁcantly enhanced by turbu- lence. Thus, anon-dimensional frequency xþ is commonly used to characterize turbulent pulsating ﬂows (e.g.): xþ ¼ xm u 2 s : ð22Þ Using the non-dimensional frequency, Scotti and Piomelli formulated an adapted non-dimensional Stokes lengthl þ s that can be directly related to the classical Stokes lengthds: l þ s ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ xþ r ¼ us m ds where ds ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 m x r : ð23Þ It directly follows that the Womersley number Wo may also be interpreted in terms of the Stokes boundary layer thickness: Wo /C 24 h ds : ð24Þ A common method to quantify the strength of pulsations is to relate the velocity amplitude to the mean ﬂow velocity in the center-plane (indexc): /C 15¼ au uref /C 10/C 11 /C 12/C 12/C 12/C 12/C 12 c : ð25Þ Thus, /C 15< 1 describescurrent dominated ﬂows, which are mainly controlled by the forcing frequency. Values of/C 15> 1( pulsa- tion dominated ﬂows) indicate the presence of ﬂow reversal. In the present study, ﬂows in the range of emerging ﬂow reversal/C 15/1:2 are referred to as ﬂows withmoderate amplitudes. Large amplitudes include strongly pronounced effects of ﬂow reversal (/C 15’2). The enhancement of heat transferg is deﬁned as the normalized increase of the wall heat transfer of the pulsating ﬂow compared to a non-pulsating reference case: g ¼ qw /C 0 qw;ref qw;ref ¼ Nu /C 0 Nuref Nuref : ð26Þ Positive values ofg indicate an enhancement in heat transfer, while negative values quantify a reduction. 2.07. CFD solver setup The numerical implementation is carried out with the ﬁnite vol- ume software Open FOAM (Version v 1706+). The PISO algo- rithm is used to iteratively solve the system of discretized partial differential equations derived from conservation of mass, momen- tum and energy. The ﬂexibility of the open source code allows for required adjustments, including source terms, LES models and averaged outputs for post-processing. The chosen simulation parameters with constant properties are displayed in Table 2. The mesh applied consists of 66/C 2 66 /C 2 102 cells on a structured grid. In periodic stream-wise and span-wise direction, the cells are arranged in an equidistant manner. In the direction perpendicular to the channel walls, hyperbolic spacing is applied to properly resolve the wall interaction. For a steady tur- bulent ﬂow without acoustic pulsation, the ﬁrst cell center lies at zþ /C 25 0:5. In the literature, these mesh properties are found to be sufﬁcient for a mesh-independent LES of the problem at hand. In additional to the provided references, the benchmark case provided by Scotti and Piomelli was reevaluated: Mesh resolutions with ﬁrst cell center down tozþ /C 25 0:1 were considered. It was found that the velocity at the wall and at the channel center as well as wall heat ﬂux deviate by less than 1:5%. Thus the mesh- independence reported in the literature is conﬁrmed. To assure an adequate consideration of large stream-wise ﬂow structures, an extended periodic simulation domain of Lx ¼ 6 ph was studied. Only very small differences between the two domains were observed in ﬁrst-order statistics (velocity and wall heat ﬂux) and second order statistics (Reynolds shear stres- ses). Thus it is concluded that the domain size of Lx ¼ 2 ph is sufﬁ- cient to capture dominant eddy structures of the problem under investigation. 6 S. van Buren et al / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 144 118585 A.4 Large Eddy Simulation of Enhanced Heat Transfer in Pulsatile Turbulent Channel Flow 3. Validation Three exemplary operation points with acoustic forcing are described and compared to some of the data available in the liter- ature to serve as a validation for the turbulent pulsating case. The cases correspond to the ones studied experimentally by Tardu et al, which were subsequently also used in the numerical studies of Scotti and Piomelli, Wang and Lu and Cardenas. Table 3 lists the key parameters of the three different computed cases in the present study compared against the ones used by the investigations mentioned. All cases lie in the current domi- nated regime with a normalized velocity center-line amplitude of approximately /C 15/C 25 0:7. The different cases are simulated using the numerical setup presented in the previous section and run for several periods to obtain robust temporal and phase averaged statistics.Fig. 3 shows the axial velocity components after performing the triple decom- position given by Eq.(17) and plotted in wall units. The proﬁles of the present LES simulations are compared against the results of the investigations listed in Table 3. The ﬁrst row in the ﬁgure shows the time averaged part of the non-dimensional axial veloc- ity uþhi with (uþ ¼ u=us), which clearly follows the classical law of the wall. In all frequency regimes, the proﬁles collapse to the clas- sical law of the wall uþhi ¼ 2:5 l nzþðÞ þ 5 and uþhi ¼ zþ, respec- tively, denoted by the dashed lines and the agreement between the different investigations is very good. Especially close to the wall, velocity variations are smaller than 2%. Considering the more central log law region, deviations to previous numerical studies remain below 10%. In the low frequency regime, it seems that the logarithmic region is shifted slightly to a position closer to the wall. For the other frequencies, the average proﬁles lie close to the ones of the stationary case without pulsations. The middle row shows the ensemble averaged velocity amplitudeaþ u normal- ized by its center-line valueaþ uc. As expected, the thickness of the turbulent Stokes layer is inversely proportional to the square- root of the forcing frequency ranging from 10 in the high to 500 in the low frequency regime (compare Eq.(23)). Again, the concor- dance between the three investigations is remarkably good. Finally, the third row in the ﬁgure gives the phase difference D/u ¼ /u zðÞ /C 0 /u hðÞ between the wall and channel center-line velocity ﬂuctuations. Unfortunately, the wall normal proﬁles of this quantity are not given in the publication of Scotti and Piomelli, only the values for the skin friction phase are provided, such that only one value per frequency case is plotted in the third row of Fig. 3. For high frequencies, the behavior is almost identical to the one of laminar pulsating channel ﬂow. Due to the lower momentum of the ﬂuid close to the wall, it reacts faster to the pres- sure gradient pulsations, leading to a phase advance ofp=4 as pre- dicted by Lighthill. For lower frequencies this phase advance reduces. It is interesting that in the low frequency case, the phase of the near wall region decreases further, even takes on negative values. The magnitude of this phase lag is of the order ofp=40 in the case studied here. Concerning the phase, the degree of confor- mity between the three investigations is very good. It is important that the comparison between the three investi- gations is valid even though different turbulent Reynolds numbers are used in each of them, ranging from Res ¼ 432 in the experi- mental study to Res ¼ 180 in the study by Cardenas. The forc- ing frequencies are chosen such that the resulting turbulent Stokes numbers l þ s are comparable, representing the low, medium and high frequency regimes, respectively. This preliminary comparison conﬁrms that, concerning the momentum transfer, the proper sim- ilarity parameters are the non-dimensional frequencyxþ or Stokes length l þ s and the velocity amplitude ratio at the channel center- line, as proposed by Scotti and Piomelli. Concerning the thermal response of the ﬂow to the harmonic unsteadiness, the situation only has limited similarity with the hydrodynamic response. This is easily explained by the different fundamental driving mechanisms: The velocity ﬁeld is driven by the imposed pressure gradient whereas the temperature ﬁeld results from the potential of a heated upper channel wall and a cooled lower channel wall. As already shown by Wang and Lu, for the three cases investigated, the time independent part of the non-dimensionalized temperature plotted in wall normal direction follows also the logarithmic law of the wall with a near wall buffer layer and a logarithmic bulk region.

Wang and Lu showed that the thermal penetration length is strongly dependent on the ﬂuid properties as described by the Prandtl number. They studied the response of a turbulent ﬂow of Nu /C 25 28 and a series of Prandtl numbers Pr ¼ 0:1; 1; 10; 50, and 100 to harmonic velocity ﬂuctuations. Unfortunately, Wang and Lu do not provide the data in a way that is easy to reproduce and comparisons can only be performed qual- itatively. The results of Cardenas are obtained at a lower tur- bulent Reynolds number and thus the range of the non- dimensional wall distance differs. As a consequence, this also limits the validation to qualitative conclusions. Fig. 4 shows the triple decomposition components computed from the present LES plotted in wall normal direction. The plot on the left shows the time independent component for the three frequency regimes. It is evident that this component is relatively insensitive to the harmonic forcing of the ﬂow, in agreement with the results of Wang and Lu and Cardenas. Concerning the orga- nized pulsations given by the temperature amplitude aþ T and marked on the right side of the ﬁgure, the penetration length of the perturbations is also inversely proportional to the forcing fre- quency. However, the magnitude of the temperature oscillations strongly depends on the forcing frequency and the reference Nus- selt number. At high frequencies, the oscillations are marginal. For the small Prandtl and Nusselt numbers used in the present inves- tigation, the temperature oscillations become relevant only at lower frequencies. This is in agreement with the observations of Wang and Lu and Cardenas. Beside the ﬁrst-order ﬂow statistics presented above, second- order Reynolds shear stresses are validated against the benchmark case (l þ s ¼ 7) by Scotti and Piomelli in Fig. 5. The time- averaged Reynolds stress is deﬁned as Rþ ij ¼ du 00 i u 00 j, where the veloc- ity u is made dimensionless byus. The harmonic pulsation ampli- tude is denoted by Aþ ij. Again, the shear stresses of the LES capture the DNS-benchmark quite well. Largest deviations show at wall- normal direction (Rþ 33 and Aþ 33). This corresponds well to the ﬁnd- ings of Scotti and Piomelli. In Fig. 6, the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum Eþ is presented as another important second-order benchmark. The two- dimensional spectrum is calculated as the integral over a circle in Fig. 3.

Results are presented at four equi- spaced times of a cycle (u ¼ xt /C 0 2 pn, no speciﬁcation of phase lag is given in) at for different heightszþ. Unfortunately, no qualitative comparison to the results of Scotti and Piomelli is possible, as they do not specify dimensional values of the wave- length. However, a qualitative comparison shows good agreement. In particular, the cutoff lies outside the inertia range which justiﬁes the dynamic LES approach. Likewise, the wavy characteristics of the magnitude in the energy spectrum Eþ is reproduced. This holds especially in regions close to the wall. Based on the good agreement with the data of previous investi- gations, it can be stated with conﬁdence that the test case setup and LES solver used in the present study reproduce the hydrody- namic and thermal behavior of turbulent pulsating ﬂows with good accuracy. 4. Intermediate relaminarization of current dominated ﬂow A closer examination of the ensemble averaged ﬂow velocities for three frequenciesl þ s ¼ 7; 14 and 35 is given in Fig. 7. For the center-plane velocity uþ c (Fig. 7 a) it is apparent that the proﬁles of high and medium frequencies almost match, while the pulsating velocity amplitude is slightly larger at the lower frequency level. Regarding the velocity in the cell closest to the wall (zþ ¼ 0:5, Fig. 7 b) a sine pulsation is again found for high and medium fre- quency, showing a phase lag of D/u /C 25 p=4 to the center ﬂow. How- ever, at low frequencyl þ s ¼ 7, the periodic velocity clearly deviates from a sine wave in the wall region, with a steep velocity increase around the assumed position of the sine oscillation maximum. Searching for an explanation of this effect, in Fig. 8 the prevail- ing ﬂow regime is evaluated by the wall distance resolved ensem- ble average of the velocity turbulent energyk þ in span-wise y- direction. At high frequency l þ s ¼ 7 (left) only marginal changes of the ﬂow structure are evident, ask þ y remains almost constant in all characteristic ﬂow regions (viscous sublayer, buffer layer, log-law region and outer layer). In the case of medium frequency l þ s ¼ 14, increasing temporal changes ofk þ y begin to develop within the buffer layer atzþ ¼ 10:1 and the log-law region atzþ ¼ 35:9 and 100:4. Lastly, at low frequenciesl þ s ¼ 35, a strongly transient behavior of the turbulent energy is displayed: As the ﬂow velocity decreases, the turbulent energy decreases to values close tok þ y ¼ 0. This behavior is indicative of a gradual relaminarization of the ﬂow, which is made possible by intervals of low ﬂow velocities due to the low frequency[14,33–37]. Once the momentum driven ﬂow velocity increases, a sudden increase in the span-wise kinetic energy k þ y occurs, predominately in the log-law region. This behav- ior is interpreted as a transition from a laminar to a turbulent ﬂow regime. We are aware that neither the ensemble averaged span-wise turbulent energy hk þ y ip, nor the sub-grid scale energyhk þ sgsip as it is used in Section 5, describe the turbulent ﬂow properties in an extensive manner. However, they provide a meaningful refer- ence for a ﬁrst interpretation of ﬂow regimes and turbulence inten- sity as it is intended in the present study. Comparison of the two values shows good qualitatively agreement, particularly phase angles of characteristic points as minima am maxima match well. For future studies, a more detailed investigation of contributing turbulence scales is of interest. Fig. 9 further substantiates this argument, showing instanta- neous span-wise ﬂow velocities at four instances of time: At the ﬁrst instance, corresponding tou ¼ 1=4 p, only minor ﬂuctuations are present throughout the channel. Especially within the outer layer, where wall effects are smallest, almost no span-wise ﬂow occurs, indicating an almost laminar ﬂow. Within the short period of time between u ¼ 1=4 p and 1=2 p a distinct ﬂow transition Fig. 5.

Mean- while the outer layer remains mostly untouched by the transition. At u ¼ p span-wise velocity ﬂuctuations begin to extend into the outer layer. With decreasing ﬂow velocities, the dissipation of tur- bulent ﬂuctuations throughout the channel is initialized and clearly visible atu ¼ 3=2 p. No distinct transition from high turbu- lence to a laminar-like ﬂow is apparent. Instead, the relaminariza- tion appears as a gradual process over the remaining 87:5% of the period fromu ¼ 1=2 p to 1=4 p. Regarding the velocity close to the wall shown in Fig. 7 b, the effect of the sudden increase of stream-wise velocity coincides with the ﬂow transition observed in Fig. 8 and 9: the transition from laminar to turbulent occurs quickly in the buffer layer and the log-law region between u ¼ 1=4 p and 1=2 p. Driven by the transition, turbulent momentum transport is enabled from higher ﬂow velocity regions of the inner channel. Likewise, the higher velocity amplitude in Fig. 7 a is explained by lower frictional resis- tance during the prevalence of laminar ﬂow characteristics. Fig. 7.

Enhanced heat transfer at moderate pulsation amplitudes 5.01. Inﬂuence of forcing frequency The temporal average of the EHT^g, as it is deﬁned in Eq.(26),i s depicted in Fig. 10 a. For high and low frequencies l þ s ¼ 7 and l þ s ¼ 35, respectively, an overall negative EHT and thus a reduction of heat transfer in the pulsating ﬂow occurs. Furthermore, EHT decreases monotonously with increasing pulsation amplitudes. Within a range of medium forcing frequencies, a slight enhance- ment of the overall heat transfer up to^gmax /C 25 7:5% is observed. For a more detailed understanding of the inﬂuence of frequency, additional medium level frequencies besidesl þ s ¼ 14 are evaluated, as proposed by Scotti and Piomelli. All curves in the medium frequency range share the characteristics of an initial increase in EHT. A maximum is shown at pulsation amplitudes close to center-plane ﬂow reversal (/C 15¼ 1), before further increase in pulsa- tion amplitude leads to a reduction of EHT^g. The circles in Fig. 10 a denote simulations with a dimensionless momentum amplitude aþ p;x ¼ 5000 xþ, corresponding to the value proposed and investigated by Scotti and Piomelli.I n Fig. 10 b, the EHT of these cases is evaluated as the ensemble aver- age over several pulsation period to display phase dependent char- acteristics: At high frequencies (l þ s ¼ 7), the ensemble averaged EHT ghi p remains almost constant over the complete period, describing a shallow harmonic sine oscillation. With a decrease in frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation shifts into the posi- tive EHT domain, leading to a temporal averaged positive EHT as shown in Fig. 10 a. The moment of the local maximum moves to an earlier phase angle, while the clear characteristics of a sine wave slightly regresses up to a Stokes layer ofl þ s ¼ 14. The examination of the timing of maximum heat transfer indicates the period of temporal ﬂow velocity minimums (compare Fig. 7 a and b). The observation of maximum heat transfer at periods close to ﬂow reversal with maximum turbulence agrees well with experi- mental investigations: Dec and co-workers[5–8] also identiﬁed turbulence in the shear layer to be responsible for the enhanced heat transfer during times of ﬂow reversal. In addition, they emphasize the effect of strong transverse convection.The mecha- nism that generates the convection could neither be elucidated by Dec and co-workers (secondary ﬂows or coherent vortex struc- tures), nor it is observed in the numerical setup of this study. Com- parison to studies of Habib et al and Hemida et al are limited, as the setups under investigation differ (e.g. spatial devel- oping laminar ﬂow vs. transient turbulent ﬂow). At the lowest frequency (l þ s ¼ 35), clear differences to the other cases are apparent: A pronounced shift to negative values of EHT ghi p is accompanied by a distortion of the sine characteristics. Recalling the evaluation of ﬂow regimes in Section 4, the steep pos- itive incline in EHT corresponds to the period of ﬂow transition from laminar to turbulent characteristics. This conforms well with the assumption of increased convective heat transfer in turbulent ﬂows. The subsequent strong decline with large negative EHT val- ues far below those discussed at higher frequencies is reasoned by the decreased heat transfer connected to laminar ﬂows. 5.02. Inﬂuence of pulsation amplitude While Section 5.01 mainly focused on the impact of frequency on EHT, this section studies the impact of pulsation amplitudes in a more detailed manner. Therefore, the medium forcing frequency of l þ s ¼ 14 (Wo/C 25 35:4), which shows maximum EHT performance among the cases considered in the present study (see Fig. 10 a), is selected. This observation coincides well with the results of Wang and Zhang, who found identiﬁed an optimum Womersley number Wo WZ /C 25 40 at which heat transfer is maximally enhanced. Recall the importance of ﬂow regime and turbulence intensity as remarked in Section 4. Five distinct velocity amplitudes (/C 15¼ 0:5; 0:7; 0:8; 1:0 and 1:2) are compared, where the case of/C 15¼ 0:7 corresponds to the pulsa- tion amplitudes studied by Scotti and Piomelli and which was already presented in the validation study in Section 3.I n Fig. 11 a and b the ensemble averaged velocity at the center-plane and in the wall-closest cell (zþ ¼ 0:5) are shown. Compared to abrupt changes as observed at low frequencies (Fig. 7),b a sine wave behavior prevails, indicating no sudden transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow characteristics. This assessment is also supported by the turbulent kinetic sub-grid scale energyk þ sgs within the buffer layer, given in Fig. 11 c: no abrupt increase of turbulent energy is evident. However, pulsation amplitude has clear effect on sub- grid scale energy, and thus the intensity of turbulence: After times of above average ﬂow velocity, the turbulent energy between the buffer layer and the log-law region increases to its peak, while periods of below average ﬂow velocity coincide with a decrease in turbulent energy. An increase in pulsation amplitude is associ- ated with higher peaks as well as lower minima in turbulent energy. Considering temporal average, the changes in turbulent energy are only marginal, as it is indicated by the markers on the right side of Fig. 11 c. Finally, the ensemble averaged EHT ghi p is illustrated in Fig. 11 d. In a qualitative evaluation, periods of high turbulence are almost immediately followed by a positive EHT and vice versa, indicating a slights time lag between the turbulent kinetic energy k þ sgs and the enhancement in heat transferg The degree of turbu- Fig. 10.

S. van Buren et al / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 144 118585 11 Reproduction of Papers lence between the buffer layer and the log-law region shows qual- itative accordance with the EHT. For a more quantitative evaluation, the ratio of maximum and minimum EHT amplitudes to the corresponding sub-grid kinetic energy k þ sgs in the log-law region atzþ ¼ 35:9 is show in Fig. 12. The plot underlines the direct inﬂuence of turbulence on the enhancement of convective heat transfer. Overall, a close to linear relation is found between the unresolved turbulent energy and the heat transfer, indicated by the approximately constant ratios. This correlation does not only hold for the maximum and minimum val- ues as already qualitatively reported, but is also valid for the over- all temporal averaged heat transfer, which is the key parameter of interest in the present study. Since the variation of time-averaged turbulence as a consequence of increasing pulsation amplitude is only marginal, an almost constant overall EHT^g presents a plausi- ble result, recalling that enhancement in heat transfer is strongly connected to intensity of turbulence. The absence of generation of turbulence and its gradual dissipation during periods of low ﬂow velocity, that are predominately present at times close to ﬂow reversal, leads to almost no increase in time-averaged turbulence for increasing pulsation amplitudes/C 15. As a consequence, the present study is extended to larger pulsa- tion amplitudes to diminish the effect of slow ﬂow velocities by increasing negative ﬂow velocities. In the following section, the accompanying higher degree of turbulence and its correlation to the EHT are presented. 6. Extension to large pulsation amplitudes As outlined in the previous section, there are strong indications that the effect of large EHT is connected to high pulsation ampli- tudes with signiﬁcant ﬂow reversal: Previous studies mainly focused on ﬂows approaching ﬂow reversal. However, the previous ﬁndings of this study show that periods of low ﬂow velocities, as they primarily exist in ﬂows close to ﬂow reversal, introduce time-spans of absence of turbulence generation. Thus, one novelty this study has shown is that ﬂows close to ﬂow reversal are char- acterized by a net dissipation of turbulent energy. It follows that the time-averaged turbulence intensity stays almost constant for a range of increasing pulsation amplitudes. Recalling the coupling of turbulence and enhancement in heat transfer (see Section 5.02), an extension of this study to higher pulsation amplitudes is pro- posed. The presence of large reversed ﬂow velocities shortens the periods of low ﬂow velocities and thus prolongates periods of tur- bulence generation. Wang and Zhang followed a similar approach and studied comparable large pulsation amplitudes in a tube. However, they applied a RANS approach which was judged to be insufﬁcient for the problem at hand. In this section, results for ﬂows with strongly pronounced ﬂow reversal (/C 15> 1:2 up to/C 15/C 25 6) are presented atl þ s ¼ 14. Fig. 11. Phase related characteristics at medium frequency ofl þ s ¼ 14 for various pulsation amplitudes:/C 15¼ 0:5(, ), /C 15¼ 0:7(, ), /C 15¼ 0:8(, ), /C 15¼ 1:0(, ) and /C 15¼ 1:2(, ).

Four different pulsa- tion amplitudes are selected, starting at/C 15¼ 1:4 (slight effects of ﬂow reversal) and ranging up to/C 15¼ 5:7 (mainly pulsation domi- nated ﬂows). At the center-plane, a regular sine-wave shape of the velocity is present. On the other hand, close to the wall, the ensemble averaged velocity ﬂuctuations are of more irregular shape for high pulsation amplitudes. As described in Section 4, ﬂow transitions and altered momentum transfer from the inner channel to the wall region result from this behavior. Furthermore, with increasing pulsation amplitudes the mean ﬂow velocity at the center-plane decreases signiﬁcantly from approximately 20 to 8 (compare temporal average markers on the right side of Fig. 13 a). This results from the periodic computa- tional setup, where the time-averaged pressure gradient maintains the mean ﬂow inspite of the wall shear stress. With the speciﬁed turbulent Reynolds number Res ¼ 350 this pressure gradient is constant. Expressing the skin friction as the gradient of the aver- aged wall velocity (markers on the right side of Fig. 13 b), it is found that this value meets the requirement of being constant over the full range of pulsation amplitudes. Therefore, higher wall shear stress induced by an increase in average turbulence causes the decrease of mean ﬂow velocity. The corresponding degree of turbu- lence is indicated by the kinetic energy iny-direction as show in Fig. 14. For the cases studied before (0< /C 15< 1:2), only a negligible change of the mean center-plane ﬂow velocity was observed, as also the overall degree of turbulence was only marginally affected (compare case of/C 15¼ 1:4 i n Fig. 14 where span-wise velocity per- turbations are still small). Note that different boundary conditions were used by Wang and Zhang where they modeled the entire tube geometry instead of a periodic section. Thus, they applied a ﬁxed volume ﬂow rate instead of the local pressure gradient. For a frequency corresponding to l þ s ¼ 14, the amplitude- dependent enhancement in heat transfer is shown in Fig. 15.U p to a pulsations of/C 15/C 25 2, only minor EHT exists. This range coincides with the previous investigations at medium amplitudes up to slight ﬂow reversal. As expected previously, a local minimum exists (at/C 15/C 25 2). For larger pulsation amplitudes with/C 15> 2 a sig- niﬁcant increase in EHT occurs. A doubling of heat transfer com- pared to the turbulent reference case without pulsation is reached at/C 15/C 25 4:5. The results by Wang and Zhang are also included in Fig. 15. The reader is reminded of the different scenarios under investiga- tion: Wang and Zhang studied a spatially developing pipe ﬂow. On the contrary, the objective of the present study is to investigate the enhanced heat transfer in a fully developed pulsatile turbulent channel ﬂow. Effects of relaminarization and subsequent transition to turbulence may be connected to characteristics of developing ﬂows. Further discrepancies between the conﬁgurations are the two-dimensional RANS approach with a ﬁxed ﬂow velocity at the inlet (vs. a pressure gradient driven ﬂow). Thus a 1:1 correspon- dence should not be expected. Nevertheless, in terms of non- dimensional characteristics, the two cases compare remarkably well: Wang and Zhang apply a different deﬁnition of the Reynolds number, yielding a value of Re WZ ¼ 25000 whereas the problem under investigation corresponds to Re WZ ¼ 24845. The frequency is connected to the Womersley number, which is Wo WZ ¼ 40 in the work of Wang and Zhang, while Wo¼ 35:4 for the present case at l þ s ¼ 14. Qualitatively, the results of both studies agree: At high Fig. 13.

S. van Buren et al / International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 144 118585 13 Reproduction of Papers pulsation amplitudes, a signiﬁcant increase in convective heat transfer is predicted, while small pulsation amplitudes only lead to marginal enhancement up to 6%. However, the overall enhance- ment of the present study is smaller than that reported by Wang and Zhang. In addition, between/C 15/C 25 1 and 2, the small local decrease in EHTg is not found by Wang and Zhang. In labora- tory scale, Perry and Culick reported EHT proportional to the oscillation amplitude. This characteristic also shows in the results of the present study for pulsation amplitudes/C 15> 2:5. A more precise view of the period at which the enhancement occurs is provided in the ensemble averaged depiction in Fig. 16: Over the pulsation period the enhancement is not uniform, but there are sections of signiﬁcant increase and times of minor increase (or even decline) for the four exemplary amplitudes under investigation. Again, a strong link between turbulence and EHT is observed. Especially accounting for the log-law region at zþ ¼ 35:9( Fig. 14, center), periods of high EHT relate to periods of high turbulence and vice versa. For lower amplitudes (/C 15¼ 1:4), only one peak in EHT exists. This is explained by low turbulence at periods close to ﬂow reversal when velocity ﬂuctuations recede while the ﬂuid is close to rest. With increasing pulsation ampli- tudes, these periods of rest are quickly passed and instead, times of high reverse ﬂow velocity establish. Thus a second peak in tur- bulent energy as well as EHT develops at times of maximum ﬂow reversal. Summarizing, at high pulsation amplitudes the causes of EHT are twofold: ﬁrstly, increased ﬂow velocity and correlating turbu- lence enhances the convective heat transfer and secondly, long periods of ﬂow velocities close to rest are replaced by times of large (negative) ﬂow velocities. 7. Conclusions This study investigates by Large Eddy Simulation (LES) the impact of standing acoustic waves on convective heat transfer mechanisms in turbulent channel ﬂows. In accordance with the lit- erature, where the largest enhancement of heat transfer is reported to occur at locations of maximum velocity ﬂuctuations, the domain of investigation is set at a pressure node. Assuming large acoustic wave lengths compared to the size of the simulation domain, an incompressible simulation approach is justiﬁed. The use of cyclic boundary conditions and a momentum driven ﬂow allows for a fully developed turbulent ﬂow proﬁle. The LES approach employed is validated successfully against the DNS data of Scotti and Piomelli. Compared to the work of Car- denas, ﬂows with larger turbulent Reynolds numbers are included in the present study. Besides the dynamic determination of the localized turbulent viscosity msgs, a layer-averaged calculation of the turbulent Prandtl number Prsgs is applied. Simu- lations with constant Prandtl number Prsgs ¼ 0:9, which where per- formed for reference, show that this procedure affects the predicted heat transfer only marginally. Thus the choice of a con- stant turbulent Prandtl number is justiﬁed in further investiga- tions. Overall the ﬂow ﬁeld characteristics show very good agreement with the literature. The maximum temporal averaged enhancement of heat transfer (EHT) reported in the ﬁrst part of the present study reaches values of up to 7:5% and occurs at medium pulsation frequencies and amplitudes close to ﬂow reversal. The enhancement remains far below the increase of more than 100% reported in experiments (e.g. ). Evaluation of the phase dependent heat transfer shows momentary enhancement of more than 60%. A detailed investigation reveals a strong correlation between EHT and the respective momentary ﬂow regime, in particular its degree of turbulence: At times of high turbulence, especially in the log-law region of the ﬂow, heat transfer is enhanced, while the prolonged absence of large velocity gradients during periods of ﬂow stagnation close to ﬂow reversal induces a decline in heat transfer. This observation presents an important novelty and sug- gests further study. It also aligns with the hypothesis of Dec and co-workers[5–8] that increased turbulence in the shear layer is responsible for enhanced heat transfer. The reported transverse ﬂows at times of ﬂow reversal were not reproduced in the current study. Reassessing the problem at hand with these ﬁndings, the exam- ination of larger pulsation amplitudes presents the logical exten- sion and a central novelty of the present study: In the second part, ﬂows with forcing resulting in relative pulsation amplitudes /C 15/C 29 1 are investigated to account for increased turbulence. Turbu- lence activity is enhanced because on the one hand ﬂow velocity amplitudes are higher, while on the other hand periods during which the ﬂuid is nearly at rest are shorter. The simulations at high amplitudes conﬁrm the correlation between turbulence and EHT. Starting at/C 15/C 25 2, a continuous and signiﬁcant enhancement of heat transfer g is found. At /C 15/C 25 4:5, the enhancement exceeds an increase of 100%. Thereby, conclusions from the literature, which report enhanced heat transfer as a highly relevant mechanism in turbulent pulsating ﬂows, are reproduced for the ﬁrst time in an LES based computational study. In future studies, the contribution of the resolved turbulent ﬂuctuations to the enhancement of heat transfer is of great inter- est. In particular, the impact of participating turbulence scales and the relevance of ﬂow regions deﬁned by the wall normal dis- tance zþ may contribute to a coherent understanding of the phe- nomena. Furthermore, the non-dimensional results presented in this study are to be transfered and evaluated under the physical conditions of a rocket combustion chamber.

Polifke ∗ Technical University of Munich, Department of Mechanical Engineering 85748 Garching b. M¨ unchen, Germany Abstract An analytical correlation for longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory ﬂow was proposed by Kurzweg. However, the treatment was limited to laminar ﬂows, which motivates the extension of the analysis to the turbulent regime. In the present paper, turbulence-induced enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer in oscillatory channel ﬂow is investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and supplemented with analytical considerations. Incompressible ﬂow within a periodic computational domain is driven by an oscillating longitudinal pressure gradient, generating both laminar and turbulent ﬂow characteristics. A wide range of oscillation amplitudes is considered, while a constant axial tem- perature gradient is maintained at the upper and lower channel walls. Kurzweg’s analytical correlation for eﬀective longitudinal thermal diﬀusivity is simpliﬁed to match the numerical setup. The numerical results of laminar ﬂows show excellent agreement with the analytical solution. In the turbulent case, enhanced longitudinal heat transfer emerges for ﬂows characterized by the product of squared Womersley number α and Prandtl number Pr fulﬁlling α2 Pr > π. In order to explain this ob- servation, the interaction of wall-conﬁned thermal and hydrodynamics Stokes boundary layers is scrutinized, a simple correlation for the eﬀective thermal dif- fusivity in laminar oscillatory ﬂow is deduced from the analysis.

Finally, the correlation is expanded to account for the impact of turbulence intensity on heat transfer. This quantiﬁcation compares favorably against the wall-normal heat transfer, which reveals similar charac- teristic features.

Introduction The performance of acoustic resonators is strongly inﬂuenced by the tem- perature of the working ﬂuid. Large diﬀerences in temperature along the length of quarter-wave resonators further intensify the variation in performance. Such physical conditions of extreme variation in local temperature are common attributes of rocket engine combustion chambers, where resonators are used as passive damping devices. Regenerative cooling of the chamber walls induces low temperatures in the backing of the cavity, opposing the hot combustion gas at the mouth of the resonator. The risk potential is obvious: Changes in damp- ing characteristics induced by changes in local temperature (e.g. during the transient heating after ignition) jeopardize the acoustic stability and thus the integrity of the system. Therefore, the prediction and reliable understanding of heat transfer within the oscillating ﬂow within the resonator tube is crucial for a comprehensive design process. Topical research activities by the industrial ﬁeld of combustion dynamics illustrate the practical relevance of the problem at hand: Bothien and Wassmer discussed the key importance of the prevailing temperature in the tube of a Helmholtz resonator to accurately predict its reso- nance frequency. Using a seeding particle method on a resonator with a cooling purging ﬂow, ´Cosi´ c et al captured the time-averaged axial concentration gradient in the tube section. The analogy between molecular diﬀusion and heat transfer indicates a similar temperature gradient between the hot grazing ﬂow in the combustion chamber and the cooled backing of the cavity. Reproduction of Papers Strong physical similarity exists between the tube section of an acoustic resonator and oscillatory ﬂows through capillary tubes, which have been widely studied in the literature. In contrast to pulsating ﬂows, oscillating ﬂows show no time-averaged mean-ﬂow. Numerous authors report enhanced axial dispersion of passive scalars – such as contaminations – induced by oscillations. The reported enhancement in transport of contaminations exceeds the pure molecular diﬀusion by orders of magnitude. The enhancement is attributed to the interaction between oscillating radial velocity proﬁles and local variation in concentration. Thus, an eﬀective axial diﬀusion rate is formulated. All these studies are restricted to laminar ﬂows. Kurzweg elaborated on the similarity between molecular diﬀusion and heat transfer. The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence arises from a more complex deﬁni- tion of thermal boundary conditions. Indeed, Kurzweg and Zhao experimen- tally conﬁrm this hypothesis. They investigated heat transfer between two water reservoirs at diﬀerent temperatures, connected by a bundle of capillary tubes. Inducing high frequency velocity oscillations to the ﬂuid, heat transfer between the reservoirs increased by four orders of magnitude over the non-oscillating reference where conductivity was the only heat transfer mechanism. The axial velocity is deﬁned by the unsteady harmonic solution of the Navier-Stokes- equations, known as Stokes problem. In a ﬁnal step, Kurzweg developed a comprehensive analytical model for the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity. Conjugate heat transfer from the oscillating ﬂuid to the channel walls yields a general- ized formulation with multiple input parameters. In its non-dimensional form, Kurzweg identiﬁes the Womersley number αas a key parameter, highlight- ing the diﬀusivity-reducing impact of both large and small Womersley numbers, respectively. Maximum longitudinal heat transfer is reported in dependence of the Prandtl number Pr at α2 Pr ≈π. Further researchers elaborated on the the- oretical and experimental evaluation of the so-called “dream pipe” – a capillary heat transfer tube bundle (e.g. Kaviany and Nishio et al ). In his concluding remarks, Kurzweg emphasizes that his study is re- stricted to laminar ﬂows and that ”the role of turbulence in such oscillating A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. ﬂows with high ω (angular oscillation frequency ) and ∆ x (tidal displacement ) should receive special attention”. The present study directly follows Kurzweg’s suggestion and expands on ”the role of turbulence”. Accounting for material properties of metal (channel wall) and air (ﬂuid), the analytical correlation of Kurzweg (Section 2.01) is simpli- ﬁed to match the setup under investigation (Section 2.02). This allows to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions at the wall/ﬂuid interface. The investigation as- sumes an incompressible ﬂow to focus only on diﬀusive eﬀects contributing to enhanced heat transfer. Heat pump eﬀects induced by thermoacoustic density ﬂuctuations are neglected. Furthermore, evaporation of propellant is not con- sidered. The reader is reminded of the potential relevance of latent heat and liquid-vapor two-phase ﬂow (e.g. Miura et al ). A validated Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach is applied on a peri- odic channel domain (Section 3.01). After additional validated against the analytical results for the laminar case (Section 3.02), the results (Section 4) are interpreted in the physical context of boundary layer interaction (Section 4.01). Special attention is given to the case of thin hydrodynamic boundary layers at high frequencies (α= 35.04). The importance of the thermal penetration depth is elucidated. To quantify the eﬀect of turbulence intensity on the eﬀective ther- mal diﬀusivity, a deﬁnition of enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer εturb (ELHT) is proposed. Based on considerations of a laminar case (Section 4.03.01), a convective heat transfer coeﬃcient hturb is carefully deﬁned, such that it only depends on the oscillation amplitude (Section 4.03.02). The evaluation of this coeﬃcient is discussed in the context of prior studies. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the ﬁndings and oﬀers conclusions of the study. All symbols used are speciﬁed in the appended nomenclature. 2.

Second, the use of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) lifts the limitation of the analytical results to purely lami- nar ﬂow characteristics. Closing this gap already reported by Kurzweg is the main objective of this study. Furthermore, there is close correspondence to the previous study by van Buren et al, allowing to utilize an established and validated numerical setup. This section summarizes the theoretical analysis by Kurzweg. Based on the problem at hand, simpliﬁcations are suggested and exploited to map the boundary conditions of the three-dimensional simulation domain. In the last subsection, an overview of the numeric solver and its validation is given. 2.01. Laminar model of Kurzweg with conjugate heat transfer In his paper from 1985, Kurzweg presents a closed analytical formula- tion for the eﬀective longitudinal thermal diﬀusivity κe in oscillating channel ﬂow. The two-dimensional setup under investigation is sketched in Fig. 1: Two parallel solid walls conﬁne a ﬂuid channel of width 2 h in z-direction. The non- dimensional position normal to the wall reads η = z/h with the symmetry-line of the channel located at z = η = 0. Both walls are of thickness 2 b and pe- A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. riodically adjoin neighboring ﬂuid channels, yielding the indicated symmetry condition. The wall-to-channel ratio ϵ is an important geometrical parameter of the conﬁguration: ϵ≡b+ h h. (1) The unsteady but harmonically oscillating stream-wise (x-direction) velocity proﬁle ux(η,t) follows from the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes-equations. Known as ”Stokes problem”, neither initial nor axial boundary conditions are required due to temporal and stream-wise periodicity. This limits the approach to steady state oscillations (e.g. the system has overcome transient behavior from initial condition) and to locations xfar away from changes geometry (e.g. from the inlet/outlet of the channel). Assuming a laminar ﬂow, the axial velocity ux is given by the real part of the harmonic oscillation ux(η,t) = u 0 f(η)eiωt = u 0 iλ α2 [ 1 −cosh( √ iαη) cosh( √ iα) ] eiωt, (2) where u 0 is a representative velocity, t the time, ω the angular frequency, α = h √ ω/ν the Womersley number, ν the kinematic viscosity and ρ the den- sity of the ﬂuid. The non-dimensional pressure gradient is deﬁned as λ = |∂p/∂x|h 2/(ρu 0ν). For further non-dimensional interpretation, the tidal dis- placement averaged over the channel width reads ∆x= 2 u 0λ ωα2 ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐1 −tanh( √ iα)√ iα ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐. (3) To determine the local, time-dependent temperature T(x,η,t ), diﬀerential equations for the solid and the ﬂuid domain are formulated. Within the solid wall, heat conduction is the only transfer mechanism, whereas the ﬂuid domain also accounts for convective transport induced by the oscillating ﬂow. The ratio of thermal conductivities kf in ﬂuid and ks solid is denoted by µ≡kf/ks. (4) Eﬀects of viscous heating are not considered, as they are typically of negligi- ble magnitude. Adiabatic Neumann boundary conditions apply at the planes of Reproduction of Papers (a) (b) (c) (d) x η temperature gradient γ hot cold Figure 3: Schematic of oscillation-induced convective heat transfer described by Kurzweg. symmetry (z = 0 and hϵ) depicted in Fig. 1 and thermal coupling (continuous temperature and heat ﬂux) applies at the ﬂuid-solid interface (z= h). Solutions for the temperature proﬁle are found in the literature and explicitly stated by Kurzweg. Having found closed expressions for velocity and temperature, an eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe is formulated as the convective transport averaged over the channel width within one period of oscillation: −κeγ = ω 2π ∫ 2π/ω ∫ 1 ℜ[T(x,η,t )] ℜ [ u 0 f(η)eiωt] dη dt. (5) Fig. 3 illustrates the heat transfer mechanism expressed by Eq. (5): (a) Cold ﬂuid oscillates from a cold channel section (right side) to a hot channel section (left side). (b) During the residence time close to the left turning point, the ﬂuid is heated by the hot walls, indicated by the red arrows. (c) Oscillating back to the right section of the channel, the ﬂuid convectively transfers sensible enthalpy, which is then (d) transferred to the cold walls close to the right turning point, closing the loop to state (a). In summary and time-averaged over one oscillation period (compare to Eq. (5)), this yields a positive heat ﬂux resulting from the velocity oscillation. This mechanism was already described by Kurzweg. Although the title of that paper speaks of “Enhanced Heat Conduction. ”, it is clear that the mechanism of heat transfer enhancement is of essentially A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. convective. The ratio of eﬀective longitudinal thermal diﬀusivity κe (convective trans- port mechanism) and purely molecular thermal diﬀusivity κf deﬁnes the P´ eclet number Pe of the problem at hand. Furthermore, Kurzweg showed that this characteristic scales with his deﬁnition of the P´ eclet number Pe K = u 0 h/κf: κe κf = Pe ∼Pe K. (6) The correlation clearly underlines the predominant convective transport mech- anism that drives the strong longitudinal enhancement in heat transfer, at- tributed to large velocity amplitudes u 0 and small thermal diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid κf. In its non-dimensional presentation, Kurzweg formulates the solution of Eq. (5) as: κe ω∆x 2 = Pr [ (1 −H)¯h+ (1 −¯H)h ] + (¯h−¯j¯H) + (h−j H) 16α2(Pr 2 −1) ⏐⏐⏐1 −tanh( √ iα)√ iα ⏐⏐⏐ 2, (7) where h(α) = √ iαtanh( √ iα), (8) j(Pr,α) = √ i Prαtanh( √ i Prα), (9) and H(Pr,µ,σ,α,ϵ ) = 1 Pr µ √ Pr tanh( √ iα) + √σtanh( √ iσPrα(ϵ−1)) µtanh( √ i Prα) + √σtanh( √ iσPrα(ϵ−1)), (10) where Pr = ν/κf is the ﬂuid Prandtl number, σ≡κf/κs (11) the ratio of thermal diﬀusivity κ = k/(ρc) and c the speciﬁc heat capacity. The bar-operator ¯·denotes the complex conjugate of the functions h, j and H. Surprisingly, the non-dimensional presentation in Eq. (7) is solely a function of material properties (Pr, µand σ), geometry (ϵ) and Womersley number α. It is independent of the representative velocity u 0 and the prevailing uniform axial temperature gradient (compare ). Reproduction of Papers 2.02. Assumption of ﬁxed wall temperature As outlined in Section 2.01, the analytical derivations of Kurzweg con- sider conjugate heat transfer in a coupled system of ﬂuid and wall interaction. However, many setups of physical interest are characterized by a solid of high speciﬁc heat capacity c, density ρ and thermal conductivity k compared to the ﬂuid. In particular, this holds for metallic walls, conﬁning a channel ﬁlled with air. This allows for the following assumptions: kf ≪ks →µ≈0 (12) and ρfcf ≪ρscs. (13) For the ratio of thermal diﬀusivityσ, no deﬁnite limit exists, due to the opposing eﬀects of thermal conductivity and heat capacity. Regarding the geometry, the diameter of quarter-wave resonators in com- bustion chambers is typically much smaller than the wall thickness, yielding: h≪b→ϵ≈∞. (14) Physical interpretation of the proposed assumptions yields a Dirichlet bound- ary condition at the ﬂuid-solid interface ( z = h). In agreement with the previ- ous modeling, the local wall temperature is deﬁned by its gradient γ = ∂T/∂x and is depicted in Fig. 2. The simpliﬁed expression (denoted by the star ⋆) of Kurzweg’s solution (7) reads: κ⋆ e ω∆x 2 = 2 Prℜ(h) − 2 Pr ℜ(j) 16α2(Pr 2 −1) ⏐⏐⏐1 −tanh( √ iα)√ iα ⏐⏐⏐ 2. (15) This derivation exploits that H⋆ = 1 /Pr is purely real-valued. As a direct consequence, the expansion of the complex conjugate terms in the numerator of Eq. (7) simplify such that all imaginary parts cancel out. The assumptions introduced in this section were validated by comparing results of the original model (7) and the simpliﬁed result (15).

An exemplary plot at four distinct Prandtl numbers (Pr = 0.001, 0.071, 10, 1000) is shown in Fig. 4 and per- fectly reproduces the results of Kurzweg, including the maximum thermal diﬀusivity close to α2 Pr = π. The vanishing thermal diﬀusivity for both limiting cases α→0 and α→∞, respectively, is also well explained by the mechanism outlined in Fig. 3: On the one hand, low oscillation frequencies (corresponding to α→0) demonstrate a quasi-steady state. Energy is no longer convected due to the immediate thermal equilibrium. On the other hand, high frequencies (cor- responding to α→∞) result in negligible time spans of the ﬂuid close to either reversal point. Thus, there is a limit on the amount of energy that is initially induced and extracted afterward. The original model (7) and the simpliﬁed result (15) both reproduce the expected time-invariant temperatures at the wall surface. In conclusion, the choice of the computational domain presented in the next section is justiﬁed. Reproduction of Papers 3. Deﬁnition and validation of the numerical model In this section, the numerical framework is presented. The phenomena un- der investigation in the present work (longitudinal heat transfer in a turbulent oscillating channel ﬂow) fundamentally diﬀers from our previous study ‘Large Eddy Simulation of Enhanced Heat Transfer in Pulsatile Turbulent Channel Flow’. The former study focused on wall-normal heat transfer (i.e. between a cold bottom wall and a hot top wall). The eﬀect of turbulence, induced by in- creasing pulsation amplitudes, revealed a signiﬁcant enhancement in heat trans- fer over the non-pulsating reference. In contrary, the present study investigates the overall transport in stream-wise direction. Thus, the wall-normal transport only presents one part of a more complex mechanism when the ﬂuid inside the channel receives or rejects energy from/to the wall (compare Phases (b) and (d) in Fig. 3). In addition, the complete mechanism also involves convective stream-wise transport (Phases (a) and (c)) and more hidden interdependencies (e.g. a saturation of the ’thermal loading’ (Phase (b)): the ﬂuid can only receive heat until it reaches the temperature of the adjacent wall). Despite all physical deviations between the present study and the previous work, many numerical considerations can be reapplied. Section 3.01 outlines the adapted simulation domain. This is followed by the governing equations and solver setup (Section 3.02. The validation (Section 3.03) is based on comparison with experimental data and a DNS benchmark. In addition, laminar ﬂows are validated against the analytical correlation and the threshold of laminar-to- turbulent transition is compared against experimental results. 3.01. Simulation domain setup The computational domain (Fig. 6) is designed to study the eﬀect of en- hanced longitudinal heat transfer in both laminar and turbulent oscillating channel ﬂow. The lower and upper walls conﬁne the channel of width 2 h in wall-normal z-direction. No-slip velocity boundary condition and a constant temperature gradient γ in stream-wise x-direction are imposed.

The hydro- dynamic BL is smaller than the thermal BL which is smaller than the channel width. (y-direction) and stream-wise boundary patches are cyclic, allowing the ﬂuid to periodically circulate though the domain of length Lx = 2 πh and width Ly = πh. A key advantage of this approach is the self-generation of turbulent ﬂows, independent of the need for long inlet regions or turbulence inlet models (e.g. ). The simulation domain models a short stream-wise section of a long chan- nel. The upper and lower walls of this long channel are imposed with constant stream-wise temperature gradient γ. Regarding the short simulation domain, this yields a periodic temperature symmetry: Fluid leaving the ’cold’ (right) side of the domain, re-enters on the ’hot’ (left) side with a temperature jump of ∆T = γ2πh = γLx and vice versa. This approach allows to model a con- stant temperature gradient in a cyclic domain. Based on studies by Chatwin, Kurzweg used the same method for analytical derivations of capillary ﬂows between two ﬂuid reservoirs at diﬀerent temperatures. The method is applica- ble to wide technical ﬁeld of channel ﬂows conﬁned by a constant time-averaged temperature gradient (e.g. resonator tubes). The ﬂuid oscillation is driven by a harmonic momentum source term ⃗Smom Reproduction of Papers Reτ λ= a+ p,x l+ s → α Pr ∆ T/(γh) Lx/h L y/h 350 100 to 300 14 → 35.04 2.5 ×10−5 to 0.025 2 π 2π π Table 1: Physical simulation parameters. which can be expressed in terms of a non-dimensional pressure gradient λ: ⃗Smom = ∂p ∂x cos(ωt) ⃗ ex = λ ρu 0ν h 2 cos(ωt) ⃗ ex = a+ p,x p 0,xcos(ωt) ⃗ ex = a+ p,x Reτν2ρ h 3 cos(ωt) ⃗ ex. (16) In addition, Eq. (16) states the momentum source in terms of the turbulent Reynolds number Re τ and the non-dimensional amplitude a+ p,x as introduced in, where pulsating ﬂows with non-zero time-averaged mean-ﬂow are stud- ied. Although the present study does not include mean-ﬂow – and thus the deﬁnition of the turbulent Reynolds number has no physical relevance to the problem at hand – there is good reason to deﬁne λ= a+ p,x and u 0 = (Reτν)/h to facilitate comparison between the two studies. A second dimensional param- eter of relevance is the forcing frequency: In the present study, the Womersley number α is selected as its non-dimensional counterpart for direct correlation with Kurzweg. On the other hand van Buren et al choose the non- dimensional Stokes length l+ s = uτ √ 2/(ων), where uτ = Reτν/h is the friction velocity. Rearrangement of (non-dimensional) Pi groups yields α= √ 2 Reτ/l+ s. One technical application of the problem at hand is the oscillating ﬂow in quarter-wave resonators. Located in the cold recirculation zone close to the injector face-plate (Hydrogen, temperature ≈180 K, pressure ≈80 bar), typ- ical deﬁning properties are angular frequencies ω = 1000 to 10000 s −1, tube- diameters of 1.05 mm and a kinematic viscosity of ν ≈7 ×10−7 m 2/s. This yields Womersley numbers in an order of magnitude ranging fromα= 10 to 100. Note the direct correlation to the Stokes boundary layer thickness δs = √ 2ν/ω given by α = √ 2 h/δs. Hence, the present study is characterized by ﬂows of small A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. hydrodynamic boundary layers δs compared to the half channel width h. To match the non-dimensional Stokes lengthl+ s = 14 of our earlier study, a Womersley number of α= 35.04 is carefully chosen to lie well inside the range of technical interest. Table 1 summarizes the physical parameters of the present study. Yet another important aspect of the modeling approach is its applicability to compact regions of acoustic pressure nodes and justiﬁes the cross-reference to the front section of an acoustic quarter wave resonator.

Governing equations, CFD solver setup and Evaluation The numerical model was implemented in the ﬁnite volume software Open- FOAM (Version v 1706+). Using the PISO algorithm, the LES-ﬁltered sys- tem of incompressible conservation equations for mass and momentum is solved. The temperature ﬁeld is calculated as a passive scalar, neglecting eﬀects of vis- cous heating. A dynamic one-equation kinetic energy model is used to evaluate fully localized subgrid-scale viscosity and wall-distance dependent subgrid-scale Prandtl numbers. Run-time averaging of selected ﬂow characteristics is imple- mented for signiﬁcant reduction of storage consumption. A detailed description of the LES governing equations, the turbulence model applied and the CFD solver setup is provided in. The calculation of the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity in Eqn. 5 only holds for the case of laminar ﬂows described by Kurzweg. For the extended numeri- cal evaluation of the present study, the locally resolved temperature T(x,y,z,t ) and velocity ux(x,y,z,t ) (in stream-wise x-direction) applies to the ﬂuid with turbulent ﬂuctuations. In consequence, the spatial integration extends from the one-dimensional channel width to the complete and three-dimensional simula- tion/channel domain. Thereby, the two additional spatial dimensions ( x and y-direction) serve - beside the evaluation over n oscillation cycles - as an aver- Reproduction of Papers aging operator: −κe,turbγ = ω 2πn 2 h Lx Ly ∫ 2πn/ω ∫ h −h ∫ Ly/2 −Ly/2 ∫ Lx/2 −Lx/2 T(x,y,z,t ) ux(x,y,z,t ) dx dy dz dt.

Validation In our prior investigation (), the numerical framework for simulation of heat transfer in turbulent pulsating channel ﬂow was carefully validated against experimental and DNS data. This previous study serves as the basis of valida- tion for the turbulent oscillating ﬂow under investigation in the present work. Since the present work also considers laminar ﬂows, additional analytical and experimental validation for the laminar ﬂow regime is provided. The numerical set-up and the parameter range under investigation in the present work largely coincides with. In particular, the solvers, turbulence models and meshes are identical. Furthermore, ﬂuid properties as well as forcing frequencies and velocity amplitudes match. Thus, we are conﬁdent that the validation for turbulent ﬂows given in, also applies to the present work. The following paragraph summarize the scope and results of the validation study. For further details, the reader should consult our prior publication. The ﬁrst-order statistics of velocity amplitude and phase across the channel width showed good agreement to experimental data by Tardu et al. Fur- thermore, the ﬁrst-order statistics compared remarkably well to a DNS bench- mark provided by Scotti and Piomelli. The DNS data also permitted valida- tion of second-order statistics, namely the Reynolds shear stress, the harmonic amplitude and the turbulent kinetic energy spectra. Good agreement was found also for these quantities. The evaluation of the turbulent kinetic energy spectra conﬁrmed that LES cutoﬀ lies well outside the inertia. range. The stream-wise domain length Lx was found to be adequate to capture large ﬂow-structures.

In summary, we are conﬁdent that the numerical setup is well capable to accurately model the tur- bulent ﬂow regime for the problem at hand. For laminar ﬂows, simulation results are compared against the simpliﬁed Kurzweg model at the Womersley number under investigation ( α = 35.04). It is emphasized that the analytical results are based on an exact solution of con- vective and conductive heat transfer based on an exact velocity solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Neither simplifying assumptions nor (semi-)empirical (tuning-)parameters were introduced by Kurzweg, strengthening our conﬁdence in the validity of the analytical results. Fig. 5 shows perfect agreement between analytical and simulation results over the entire range of Prandtl numbers in- vestigated. As this study aims to explore the impact of turbulence in comparison to a laminar ﬂow, validation of threshold for the onset of turbulence is given in a second step. In an experimental study, Kurzweg et al classiﬁed lam- inar and turbulent ﬂows based on the non-dimensional oscillation amplitude β = ∆x √ ω/ν (compare Fig. 8 a). This parameter reveals close correspondence to the Reynolds number as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. For large Womersley numbers, as they are considered in this study, Kurzweg ob- Reproduction of Papers served laminar-turbulent transition at β ≈700. In the present numerical study, simulations were performed at four oscillation amplitudes of increasing strength, namely at λ= 100, 150, 200 and 250, which are included in Fig. 8 a and indicate λ= 100 to be laminar, only. Fig. 8 b shows the non-dimensional turbulent kinetic energy ky as it evolves over one period of oscillation (layer-averaged, measured in span-wise y-direction at the center-plain z = 0). This parameter, in contrast to Kurzweg et al, suggests that the two lower oscillation amplitudes ( λ = 100 and 150) result in laminar ﬂows, whereas the two higher oscillation amplitudes ( λ = 200 and 250) trigger turbulence. In respect to the experimental prediction, a reason- able agreement is established, with only λ = 150 deviating from the expected characteristics. One explanation are the perfectly smooth wall-surfaces and ideal (cyclic) inﬂow conditions in the CFD suppressing the laminar-to-turbulent tran- sition, whereas natural imperfections of the experiment trigger the development of turbulence. 4. Results: Eﬀective heat transfer enhanced by turbulence The present section presents numerical results on the impact of turbulence on the longitudinal eﬀective heat transfer. A deeper analysis and discussion is dedicated to two questions that arise in connection with the results: First (Section 4.01), what regions of the channel contribute to the heat transfer en- hancement? How does turbulence aﬀect the boundary layers and how deep do thermal disturbances penetrate into the channel? Second (Section 4.02), how does turbulence enhances the longitudinal advection? Or is the overall enhance- ment of longitudinal heat transfer merely related to wall-normal eﬀects? Fig. 9 a shows numerical results for the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity at a con- stant Womersley number α = 35.04. Four oscillation amplitudes (two laminar, two turbulent, compare validation in Section 3.02) are depicted vs. the Prandtl number. In addition, Fig. 9 b provides a normalized and semi-logarithmic pre- sentation of those results, which shows the enhancement attributed to the eﬀects A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. 10−5 10−4 10−3 10−2 10−1 10010−3 10−2 10−1 Pr κe /ω∆x 2 (a) Absolute double-logarithmic presen- tation of the non-dimensional eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe. 10−5 10−4 10−3 10−2 10−1 100 1.05 Pr εturb (b) Relative semi-logarithmic presenta- tion of the enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer εturb due to turbulence.

This plot suggests to deﬁne the tur- bulent enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer (ELHT) as the increase in thermal diﬀusivity relative to the analytical results for the reference case of laminar oscillating ﬂow: εturb ≡κe,turb κe. (18) Thus, an turbulence-induced enhancement in heat transfer is characterized by values of εturb > 1. Note our nomenclature that evaluates eﬀective ther- mal diﬀusivity as the increase in heat transfer of a laminar oscillation over a non-oscillating case. ELHT is purely associated to the turbulence-induced con- tribution over the laminar (but oscillating) reference. Comparing the absolute (left) and relative (right) evaluation of heat trans- fer in Fig. 9, physical relevance of the maximum in non-dimensional eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe (left) is limited. This is reasoned by the extremely small and unrealistic values of Prandtl number (Pr ≈0.00025) in the vicinity of the peak. However, when quantifying the impact of turbulence over the laminar reference (right), ELHT develops and enhances with increasing Prandtl num- ber. In particular in the range of physical relevance (e.g. air with Pr ≈0.07), Reproduction of Papers a signiﬁcant impact of turbulence is expected with a factor of about 0.5. Of course, the (absolute) non-dimensional eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe has al- ready decreased by about one to two orders of magnitude for these values of Prandtl number. Nevertheless, it still exceeds the pure thermal diﬀusivity at large oscillation amplitudes and high frequencies. As a consequence, both ef- fective thermal diﬀusivity and ELHT contribute to the physical application at hand. The ﬁndings of the numerical study are categorized as follows: 1. There is no ELHT in laminar ﬂows. Supporting prior analytical theory, this coincides with our deﬁnition of ELHT and the amplitude invariant results in Fig. 9 b ( εturb ≈1 for λ= 100 and 150). 2. At low Prandtl numbers (in particular α2 Pr < π), there is also no eﬀect of turbulence on the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity. 3. At large Prandtl numbers (in particular α2 Pr > π), an increase in the Prandtl number Pr results in an increase in ELHT εturb. 4. At large Prandtl numbers (in particular α2 Pr >π), an increase in oscilla- tion amplitude (or pressure gradient λ, respectively) results in an increase in ELHT εturb. 5. Overall, the eﬀect of ELHT is modest for the parameter range under inves- tigation and remains below 75%. However, the two previous statements indicate further enhancement at larger Womersley and Prandtl numbers (point 3.) as well as at larger oscillation amplitudes (point 4.). These observations coincide perfectly with the suggestion of Kurzweg, concluding that at high Womersley numbers α (corresponding to the right branch of α2 Pr >π) and large tidal displacements ∆ x (corresponding to large oscillation amplitudes induced by the non-dimensional pressure gradientλ) need further investigation. 4.01. Physical interpretation of thermal penetration depth This section aims to physically interpret the observations on ELHT εturb provided in the previous Section 4 (in particular at α2 Pr ≥π, see for an A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. extended analysis of this non-dimensional Π-group). For this, a more meaning- ful presentation of the boundary layers and their hydrodynamic and thermal interactions is given. Recall that the non-dimensional Womersley number α = √ 2 h/δs can be rewritten in terms of the Stokes boundary layer thickness (Section 3.01). It fol- lows that – given α= 35.04 – the results of this study are conﬁned hydrodynamic boundary layers much smaller than the channel width: δs h = √ α ≈0.004. (19) Thus, the channel ﬂow under investigation is predominantly characterized by an oscillating bulk velocity, with only relatively thin wall regions deviating from this pattern. Concerning the thermal boundary layer, an analogy may be developed: The local change in temperature generates the driving potential of the development of a boundary layer. Thus, as argued above, the small hydrodynamic boundary layer generates a wall-normal temperature potential conﬁned to the immediate vicinity of the wall. The thermal boundary layer thickness δth is given by δth = √ 2κ/ω = √ 2ν/(ωPr) = δs/ √ Pr, which can be expressed in terms of the Prandtl number Pr. The ratio of thermal boundary layer to channel width reads δth h = √ α √ Pr ≈0.004√ Pr. (20) In the present study, Prandtl numbers Pr < 1 are considered, which cor- respond to a thermal boundary layer thickness larger than its hydrodynamic counterpart. The parameter range characterized by ﬁrst emergence of ELHT (α2 Pr > π) is speciﬁed by a thermal boundary layer thickness just extending into the channel center (δth/h= √ 2/π= 0.08 ≈1). Finally, the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity is interpreted as a result of the in- teraction of hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers: Recall Eq. (5), which states that the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity results from the convective transport of temperature ﬂuctuations by an oscillating ﬂow. As a direct consequence, two competing mechanisms are induced by the two boundary layers: On the one Reproduction of Papers −1 −0.05 0 0.05 1 8 ·10−2 η κe /ω∆x 2 −1 −0.05 0 0.05 1 ·10−2 η −1 −0.05 0 0.05 1 ·10−2 η Figure 10: Spatial proﬁle of eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity across the channel width 2 h (−1 ≤η≤1) at α2 Pr = π (left), 10 π (center) and 100 π (right) for λ = 100 ( ), 150 ( ), 200 ( ) and 250 ( ), α= 35.04. hand, velocities are largest outside the hydrodynamic boundary layer, thus one might expect an increase in diﬀusivity towards the center of the channel. On the other hand, temperature ﬂuctuations diminish outside the thermal bound- ary layer, thus near wall regions within the thermal boundary layer should con- tribute dominantly to thermal diﬀusivity. Returning to the parameters under investigation, we note ﬁrst that a thin hydrodynamic boundary layer permits large bulk velocities across the channel width. Second, the thermal boundary layer width is varied by the Prandtl number Pr. Observing maximum thermal diﬀusivity at thermal boundary layers extending just into the channel center agrees perfectly with these considerations. This physical interpretation if boundary layer interplay is evident in the spatial proﬁles of the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity presented in Fig. 10. From left to right, simulation results for increasing Prandtl numbers are presented, starting at Pr = 0.0025, which corresponds to α2 Pr = π. In this conﬁguration the thermal boundary layer extends into the center of the channel, such that the entire cross-section contributes to the convective heat transfer. Additional wall- normal turbulent transport does not improve performance. In a mathematical sense, this shows by the equal areas underneath the curves, which coincide for the laminar and turbulent cases. A further decrease of the Prandtl number yields corresponding ﬁndings and is not included in Fig. 10. Turning our attention to the center and right plots of Fig. 10, the Prandtl A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. numbers are increased to Pr = 0.025 and 0.25, respectively ( δth/h = 0.025 and 0.008). For laminar cases, it is evident that the contribution of the channel center declines, as it lies clearly outside the thermal boundary layer. Consequently, the temperature in the channel center is not ﬂuctuating. For such conditions, there is a noticable eﬀect of turbulence on eﬀective longitudinal heat transfer: The turbulence-induced increase in wall-normal convective heat transfer (compare ) widens the thermal boundary layer thickness such that a larger cross- section area contributes to the enhanced longitudinal heat transfer. As the intensity in turbulence increases, the thermal penetration depth expands further into the channel. This, in turn, increases the ELHT εturb. For large Prandtl numbers Pr (center and right plot in Fig. 10) a small but not negligible reverse in heat transfer reveals inside the channel. This phenom- ena is explained by the time lag that occurs when the thermal disturbances propagate from the originating walls into the center of the channel. By the time the temperature disturbance reaches the center, the ﬂuid motion may have reversed and thus carry the thermal energy in the corresponding opposing direc- tion. Similar, supposedly unexpected behaviors show for example in the velocity over-shoot of Stokes problem. 4.02. On the longitudinal eﬀect of turbulence This section elaborates on the longitudinal convective eﬀect of turbulence. In particular, we address the question if the enhancement of longitudinal heat transfer is attributed to an increased longitudinal transport, or rather to wall- normal exchange in the boundary layers. Figure 11 summarizes selected thermal characteristics for over the complete range of parameters (top row, Section 4.01) and over the range of particular physical interest (bottom row, Section 4.03). The plots (a) and (d) on the left side denote the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe deﬁned by Eqn. (17). They clearly reveal the expected enhanced heat transfer around Pr = 0.0025, which corresponds to Kurzweg’s ﬁnding: α2 Pr ≈π. Increasing oscillation strengths drive the enhancement.

Laminar/turbulent transition:. A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. The centered plots (b) and (e) relate the ratio of eﬀective longitudinal ther- mal diﬀusivity to the molecular ﬂuid diﬀusivity: κe/κf. This deﬁnition of the P´ eclet number Pe (compare Eqn. (6)) reveals increasing values with an increase in the oscillation amplitude λ and in the Prandtl number Pr. Thereby, the P´ eclet number underlines the crucial importance of the convective transport mechanism. However, this observation directly leads to the following question: Does the turbulence signiﬁcantly increase the longitudinal convective transport? Or is it merely attributed to the underlying oscillatory motion? To quantify the longitudinal turbulent transport over a laminar reference, the laminar eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity is deﬁned as −κe,lamγ = ω 2πn 2 h∫ 2πn/ω ∫ h −h ( Lx Ly ∫ Ly/2 −Ly/2 ∫ Lx/2 −Lx/2 T(x,y,z,t ) dx dy Lx Ly ∫ Ly/2 −Ly/2 ∫ Lx/2 −Lx/2 ux(x,y,z,t ) dx dy ) dz dt, (21) where a spatial layer-wise averaging of the temperature T and velocity ux is performed before the respective multiplication, suppressing the consideration of turbulent ﬂuctuations. The plots (c) and (f) on the right side of Fig. 11 show the relative impact of turbulent eﬀects on the longitudinal convective transport: ξturb = κe,turb −κe,lam κe,lam. (22) In the laminar regime below the horizontal blue line that denotes the threshold of the limiting numerical set-up, turbulent eﬀects do not impact the longitudinal transport: ξturb = 0. In the turbulent regime, relevant longitudinal convection shows for large Prandtl numbers (i.e. low molecular thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid). This eﬀect slightly diminishes with increasing oscillation strength λ. However and in comparison with the enhancement in longitudinal heat transfer εturb (e.g. Fig. 12), the contribution of enhancement in longitudinal convection ξturb is relatively small: At the bounding parameter range with Pr = 0.79, Reproduction of Papers the longitudinal convection fulﬁlls ξturb < 18% whereas overall enhancement in longitudinal heat transfer easily exceeds 50% or even 100% (in particular at large oscillation amplitudes). In conclusion, the additional turbulence-driven longitudinal convection is of minor importance for the overall enhancement in longitudinal heat transfer. Instead, the wall-normal turbulent enhancement in heat transfer (compare also ) promotes the thermal ’loading’ and ’unloading’ of the oscillating ﬂuid. Most of the convective transfer in longitudinal direction is attributed to the regular underlying oscillation without turbulent ﬂuctuations. 4.03. Modeling This section provides a simple qualitative model for longitudinal heat trans- fer. Throughout the derivation, a conﬁned hydrodynamic boundary layer (Wom- ersley number α= 35.04) and a thermal boundary layer smaller than the channel width (α2 Pr >π) but wider than its hydrodynamic counterpart (Pr <1) is as- sumed. In a ﬁrst step, the model is qualitatively validated against the laminar ﬂow and then extended to quantify the eﬀect of turbulence. 4.03.01. Modeling without turbulence The assumptions introduced in Section 4.03 suggest a bulk temperature ap- proach, meaning that the temperature in the center is not disturbed. On the other hand, at values of Prandtl number Pr < 1, temperature disturbances occur mainly within the bulk velocity region (compare Fig. 7). Referring to the calculation of the eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity in Eq. (5), the majority of the channel cross-section shows constant bulk velocity ( δs/h ≪ 1), whereas temperature ﬂuctuations are present throughout the thermal boundary layer. Considering these constraints, a qualitative interpretation of eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity κe questions what wall-normal heat ﬂux q is transferred to the ﬂuid at the hot reversal point and then released back to the wall at the cold rever- sal point. In general, such heat ﬂux q = U∆T is expressed by the product of thermal transmittance U and the temperature potential ∆ T. As depicted in Fig. 7, the imposed temperature potential is solely induced by the local velocity A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. ﬂuctuation close to the wall. Accounting for pure wall-normal heat conduc- tion in the laminar case, the expression for the thermal transmittance U reads U ∼kf/δth ∼1/ √ Pr. In conclusion, the qualitative evaluation of Eq. (5) yields κe ω∆x 2 ∼q∼∆TU ∼ kf δth ∼ 1√ Pr, (23) suggesting inverse scaling eﬀect of the square-root of the Prandtl number Pr. Fig. 9 a includes the predicted quality of Eq. (23) (dotted lines). Very good agreement is obtained within the range of constraints for the laminar case. The agreement holds best in the range of Pr = 0.0025 to 0.025. Approaching the limits, inaccuracies result from the violation of following assumptions: • Small Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr < 0.0025) violate the assumption of bulk temperature in the center of the channel. • Large Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr >0.025) violate the assumption of constant velocities throughout the thermal boundary layer. 4.03.02. Modeling with addition of turbulence Building upon the laminar considerations given in Section 4.03.01, the impact of turbulence is included in this section. The additional wall-normal convective heat transfer induced by turbulence is denoted by the coeﬃcient hturb. Thus, hturb is deﬁned to be zero for laminar ﬂow and to increase with increasing turbulence. Considering laminar heat conduction and turbulent convective heat transfer to act in parallel the extended form of Eq. (23) reads: κ⋆ e ω∆x 2 ∼q⋆ ∼∆TU⋆ ∼∆T(U + hturb). (24) Applying the deﬁnition of ELHT εturb to be the normalized eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity in respect to the laminar case (see Section 4), it follows: εturb ∼U⋆ U ∼1 + hturbδth kf ∼1 + Nu ∼1 + hturb √ Pr. (25) In this notation the Nusselt number Nu describes the ratio of resistance based on laminar heat conduction and turbulent convection.

Fig. 12 shows results of ELHT εturb in a more extensive parametric study for the parameter range of interest (turbulent ﬂows, α2 Pr >π). The extended range of Prandtl numbers accounts for thermophysical properties of air (Pr ≈ 0.07). Furthermore, the correlation of Eq. (25) is evaluated at Pr = 0.25 for each oscillation amplitude (dotted lines). In a ﬁrst assessment, the qualitative prediction of a scaling proportional to the square-root of the Prandtl number (∼ √ Pr) holds well. Nevertheless, a more detailed discussion of limitations of validity and its physical interpretation is given at this point: • Conﬁrming ﬁndings of limitations for laminar ﬂows (Section 4.03.01), small Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr < 0.0025) violate the assumption of bulk tem- perature in the center of the channel. This error increases with additional heat transfer induced by turbulent convection, thus explaining the over- prediction of ELHT when approaching α2 Pr = π. In more physical terms, the entire channel cross-section already contributes to the eﬀective ther- mal diﬀusivity (compare Fig. 10, left plot), such that turbulence has no A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. further contribution. • Turning to large Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr ≈0.025), a slightly regressive behavior is revealed for large oscillation amplitudes. This observation has not been clariﬁed, yet. The convective heat transfer coeﬃcient hturb for each forcing amplitude is derived by ﬁtting Eq. (25) at Pr = 0.25. The result is given in Fig. 13 vs. non-dimensional pressure gradient λ. In the laminar regime, i.e. for λ≤162.05, the expected behavior of hturb = 0 is obtained. At the onset of turbulence λ> 162.05, the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient hturb increases monotonously with the oscillation amplitude. The initially large enhancement at laminar to turbulent transition is followed by a continuous decline in slope, indicating a decreasing inﬂuence of turbulence at high amplitudes. Finally, a qualitative comparison to wall-normal enhanced heat transfer is included in Fig. 13. Recall the diﬀerences between the two studies: van Buren et al. investigated enhancement of cross-stream heat transfer between two par- allel plates of diﬀerent temperature, whereas this study is concerned with axial temperature variation. Furthermore van Buren et al considered a devel- oped pulsating ﬂow, where critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of turbulence are already exceeded by the mean ﬂow velocity rather than by high oscillation amplitudes. Despite these deviations, similar characteristics exist: First, signiﬁ- cant increase in EHT does not show before the laminar/turbulent transition of the present study is reached. This coincides well with the conclusions given by van Buren et al, i.e. signiﬁcant EHT only occurs at considerable turbulent intensities. This, in turn, only occurs for ﬂows with pronounced ﬂow reversal. Second, both studies reveal an initially large enhancement at amplitudes leading to increased turbulence. This is followed by a notable decline for the two setups under investigation. Reproduction of Papers 5. Conclusions Axial heat transfer in oscillating turbulent channel ﬂow is investigated by means of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Incompressible ﬂow within a periodic computational domain is driven by a wide range of oscillating axial pressure gradients, generating both laminar and turbulent ﬂows. The analytical solution to a laminar ﬂow given by Kurzweg is simpliﬁed to consider imposed tem- perature boundary conditions rather than investigating a problem of conjugate heat transfer within ﬂuid and solid domain. This conforms well with setups of metallic walls conﬁning an air-ﬁlled ﬂuid channel. The applied numerical methods were carefully validated in a prior study. The present numerical study provides ﬁrst qualitative proof and evaluation of ELHT. For thin hydrodynamic boundary layers, a signiﬁcant turbulence- induced increase in heat transfer may exist over the laminar counterpart. In particular in the range of physically meaningful Prandtl numbers (e.g. Pr ≈0.07 for air), an enhancement of more than 100% shows. This coincides well with the conclusion given by Kurzweg, who identiﬁed the regime of α2 Pr >π to be of interest for further studies related to the impact of turbulence. The numerical results identify the crucial importance of turbulence-increased wall-normal heat transfer as a drive of the enhancement. In contrast, longitudinal turbulent convective exchange contributes little contribution on the overall mechanism. An analytical model consolidates the turbulence-induced enhanced wall- normal heat transfer with the oscillation-induced longitudinal convective trans- port to qualitatively explain the inﬂuence of the Prandtl number and the oscil- lation amplitude. Seen by themselves, neither of these mechanisms propose a novelty (e.g. wall-normal enhancement by van Buren et al and longitudinal enhancement by Kurzweg. However in aggregation, they generate insight to the physical boundary layer interaction for wall-conﬁned Stokes boundary layers (α= 35.04). First restricted to laminar ﬂows, high convective velocity prevails outside of the hydrodynamic boundary layer. Thus, most eﬀective convective heat transfer A.5 Turbulence-Induced Enhancement of Longitudinal Heat Transfer. exists, if this region of maximum velocity overlaps with the presence of tempera- ture disturbance. This thermal disturbance, in turn, is found within the thermal boundary layer. In consequence, maximum eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity is at- tributed to thermal boundary layer thicknesses approaching the channel width, or – as recognized by Kurzweg – α2 Pr ≈π. Furthermore, the presented model gives physical interpretation for the scaling of eﬀective thermal diﬀusivity with 1/ √ Pr. Based on the laminar model, the correlation is expanded to quantify the impact of turbulence on heat transfer. In this process, a turbulence intensity correlated scaling of the enhanced longitudinal heat transfer εturb ∼ √ Pr is derived and well supported by the numerical results. In a ﬁnal step, the results are compared against a setup of sole wall-normal heat transfer that reveal similar characteristic features. Thereby, conclusions given by van Buren et al substantiate the physical interpretation of the present study.

Hartmut Spliethoff Prüfer der Dissertation: Prof. W olfgang Polifke, Ph.D. Prof. Matthew Juniper, Ph.D.University of Cambridge, UK Die Dissertation wurde am 29.004.02019 bei der T echnischen Universität München eingereicht und durch die Fakultät für Maschinenwesen am 24.007.02019 angenommen. Kurzfassung Die vorliegende Dissertationsschrift untersucht die W echselwirkung zwischen Akustik und mager vorgemischten Flammen. Im Fokus stehen hierbei die ther- moakustischen Eigenschaften von Brennerﬂammen, welche gemeinhin durch die Flammen-Transfer-Funktion (FTF), also die lineare Antwort der globalen Wärme- freisetzungsrate auf akustische Störungen, beschrieben werden. Ausgangspunkt aller Untersuchungen ist die Feststellung, dass das in der Literatur vorherrschende physikalische V erständnis des vorliegenden Problems von den etablierten Erkennt- nissen zur Dynamik dünner Flammen abweicht. Während letztere hauptsächlich auf ﬂammenintrinsischen hydrodynamischen und thermodiffusiven Prozessen beruhen, dreht sich die Theorie akustisch angeregter Flammen hauptsächlich um experimentell beobachtete konvektiv transportierte Geschwindigkeitsstörungen, welche mit der Flamme wechselwirken. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es daher, beide Be- trachtungesweisen zu vereinen und dabei die wichtigsten Mechanismen der Akustik- Flammen-Interaktion herauszuarbeiten. Zu diesem Zweck wird eine neues Konzept zur niedrigdimensionalen Modellierung entwickelt, mit dessen Hilfe bestimmte, klar deﬁnierte Aspekte der zugrunde liegenden Dynamik getrennt untersucht werden können. Detaillierte numerische Rechnungen dienen zu dessen V alidierung und bi- eten zudem aufschlussreiche Einblicke in die physikalischen V orgänge. Die damit durchgeführte Analysen beschränken sich auf Schachtﬂammen. Zwei Arten der Akustik-Flammen-Strömungsinteraktion konnten identiﬁziert werden: (i) Primäre W echselwirkungen, welche ausschließlich unmittelbare Auswirkungen akustischer Störungen einschließen, und (ii) sekundäre W echselwirkungen, welche ﬂammenin- trinsische Prozesse umfassen, die im W esentlichen auf einer Kopplung zwischen Hy- drodynamik und Flammendynamik beruhen. Ein Ergebnis der durchgeführten Unter- suchungen ist es, dass das rotationsfreie akustische Feld in erster Linie die Region am Flammenfuß beeinﬂusst, während von der Akustik erzeugte abgelöste Wirbel so gut wie nicht mit der Flamme interagieren. Die daraus resultierenden primären Auslenkungen der stationären Flammenfront sind anschließend hydrodynamischen Mechanismen ausgesetzt, welche aufgrund des verbrennungsinduzierten Dichte- sprungs zu deren Anwachsen führen. Zusätzlich dazu bilden sich in der Umgebung primärer Störungen weitere, sekundäre aus. Beide Phänomene zusammen führen zu einer Amplitudenverstärkung der zugehörigen FTF, die W erte von Eins deutlich übersteigen kann. In Übereinstimmung mit der Literatur, konnte das Auftreten der genannten konvektiv transportierten Geschwindigkeitsstörungen auf eine Kopplung zwischen Hydrodynamik und Flammendynamik zurückgeführt werden. Basierend auf theoretischen Untersuchungen zur Auswirkung der Flammengeometrie auf die lineare Flammenantwort, wird abschließend eine Methode vorgeschlagen, die es er- möglicht, die für Schachtﬂammen gewonnenen Erkenntnisse auch auf andere Flam- mengeometrien wie Bunsen- oder Keilﬂammen, zu übertragen. iii Abstract This doctoral thesis analyses interactions between acoustics and lean premixed ﬂames from a thermoacoustic point of view. Special focus is put on the linear response of the global heat release rate of burner-stabilized laminar ﬂames to acoustic perturba- tions, commonly expressed by the ﬂame transfer function (FTF). The starting point of all investigations is the inconsistency between (i) the prevailing notion of the un- derlying physical mechanisms of the problem at hand and (ii) ﬁrst principle-based descriptions of the dynamics of thin ﬂames. While the latter are essentially based on hydrodynamic and thermal-diffusive modes of ﬂame propagation, the former revolve around the empirical concept of acoustically triggered convected velocity perturba- tions interacting with the ﬂame. This work strives to bring together both perceptions and, in doing so, aims to identify the skeletal processes governing acoustics-ﬂame interactions. T o this end, a ﬁrst principle-based low order modeling framework is developed, which allows to separately investigate well-deﬁned aspects of the un- derlying dynamics. High ﬁdelity numerical simulations provide instructive valida- tion data. Focusing on Slit ﬂames, two types of acoustics-ﬂame-ﬂow interactions are identiﬁed: (i) Primary interactions, which involve only immediate effects of acoustic perturbations on the ﬂame, and (ii) secondary interactions, which cover ﬂame in- trinsic processes essentially depending on a hydrodynamic ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. It is found that the irrotational acoustic ﬁeld predominantly interacts with the ﬂame base region, while vortex shedding has almost no impact. The acoustically triggered primary ﬂame displacements are subject to mechanisms of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback pro- voked by the change in density across the ﬂame sheets. These mechanisms lead to their convective growth as well as to the formation of secondary displacements, which altogether results in FTF peak gain values signiﬁcantly exceeding unity. Furthermore, in agreement with the literature, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback is found to be responsible for the mentioned convected velocity perturbations. By analyzing consequences of ﬂame geometry for the acoustic response, a simple way is suggested how to transfer the results found for Slit ﬂames to the more widespread Bunsen and W edge ﬂame con- ﬁgurations. v Acknowledgements The research project, which ﬁnally led to the completion of the thesis at hand, would not have been successful without the support and encouragement of so many helpful and great people.

And to make matters worse: complexity sells better. – Edsger W ybe Dijkstra Turbulent combustion is complex and of high technical relevance and, as a conse- quence, increasingly attracts the attention of scientiﬁc research. Laminar combustion, on the other hand, is apparently simple and of less technical relevance; accordingly, the number of fundamental studies published in this ﬁeld is receding, particularly in industry-funded research projects. Y et, most of the low-order modeling concepts used to capture the dynamics of turbulent ﬂames are derived from laminar theory. This means, blind spots in laminar theory propagate to gaps of knowledge in turbu- lent combustion and hence might hinder a more fundamental understanding as well as the development of new modeling frameworks. Ultimately, the development of highly relevant technical innovations might be delayed by just some missing insights at the very foundations of knowledge. As will be shown in the course of this the- sis, there are indeed signiﬁcant blind spots concerning the speciﬁc topic of laminar acoustic-ﬂame interactions in a thermoacoustic context. Motivated by this realization, this work is devoted to contribute to their illumination. The Thermoacoustic Problem Why are interactions between acoustics and lean premixed ﬂames important at all? This question will be answered in the following relying on three examples: (i) Lord Rayleigh’s early and fundamental studies of a Rijke tube, (ii) the extravagant Saturn V program and (iii) modern gas turbine combustors. A common feature of these three examples is that they are all prone to instabilities driven by thermoacoustic effects, which may lead to high amplitude oscillations. Due to the fact that these oscillations manifest themselves as pressure ﬂuctuations that may lead to severe sound emis- sions or even to system failure, they are usually undesired. Consequently, this section speaks of thethermoacoustic problem when referring to these kind of instabilities. CONTENTS (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: (a) : Sketch of a Rijke tube. (b): Rocketdyne F-1 engines of the Saturn V rocket with W ernher von Braun standing in front of it (taken from, Chap. 3.02).(c): Injector plate of the Rocketdyne F-1 engine (taken from ). A literal deﬁnition of the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics would include all acoustic phenom- ena in a gaseous medium that rely either on diffusive effects or entropy variations. Following Rott, however, a more restrictive deﬁnition shall be adopted here that emphasizes one essential thermoacoustic phenomenon, namely the maintenance of aerial vibrations by heat, as put by Rayleigh. This deﬁnition shall be clariﬁed in the following by use of one of the most famous thermoacoustic experimental setups, the Rijke tube [5–7]. A sketch of such a device is provided in Fig. 1 a. It consists of a vertical tube, where a metallic wire mesh (or wire gauze) is mounted somewhere in its lower half. By plac- ing a Bunsen burner right beneath its lower end, the wire mesh is heated. Removing the burner, astonishingly, an enervating high-pitched sound appears, which slowly de- cays over time. Lord Rayleigh was the ﬁrst to provide an adequate explanation of this phenomenon. According to him, the key ingredient responsible for the sound genera- tion is the right phasing between pressure ﬂuctuations and heat transfer from the wire to the ﬂow: Only if heat is added to the ﬂuid at the moment of greatest condensation or taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, a self-sustained oscillation can develop, which manifest itself as a clearly audible sound. The phasing is essen- tially deﬁned by the acoustic properties of the tube and by the dynamics as well as the location of the heat source. One of the most illustrative examples of the drastic consequences and difﬁculties re- lated to thermoacoustic phenomena is taken from the endeavor of the USA to bring a man to the moon. Such a mission requires the possibility to cope with high payloads, since a lot of equipment has to be brought into earth orbit. For that reason, the NASA developed the Saturn V rocket. Its ﬁrst stage was equipped with ﬁve Rocketdyne F-1 engines, each providing a thrust of at least 6672 k N, whose impressive di- mensions are illustrated in Fig. 1 b. One important problem encountered during their CONTENTS development were combustion instabilities caused by thermoacoustic effects, which caused three total engine losses and several emergency shutdowns during the testing phase. In order to solve this problem and to develop a dynamically stable system, the Project First program was initiated in 1962. The desired performance spec- iﬁcations required certain combustion chamber and nozzle geometry designs and, hence, those parameters could not be changed. The principal leverage of the engi- neers to improve system stability was the design of the injector as well as the thereon attached bafﬂes, see Fig. 1 c. During the course of this project, about 2000 full scale test of 14 basic injector patterns and 15 bafﬂe conﬁgurations were conducted. Knowing that the two turbopumps used delivered nominal ﬂow rates of 984 l/s of fuel and 1577 l/s of oxidizer, one can imagine the costs and logistical requirements of this series of tests. This emphasizes the severity of the (thermoacoustic) combus- tion instabilities they had to cope with. Ultimately, an injector design was found that enabled stable operation as well as safe 165 ﬁrst seconds on the long journey to the moon. With the increasing signiﬁcance of gas turbines for the generation of electrical power or for the propulsion of airplanes during the second half of the previous century, a va- riety of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities, which limit the operational ranges of these devices or require advanced damping strategies, have been detected. Further- more, thermoacoustic effects enhance acoustic emissions of gas turbine combustors, commonly termed as combustion noise, whose reduction increasingly shifts into the focus of current research [13–15]. Depending on the area of application, different challenges have to be met. In the following, the focus is put on stationary gas tur- bines. Fig. 2 a shows a modern low-emission stationary gas turbine as used for the genera- tion of electrical power. In the design of such devices, engineers have to manage a balancing act between thermodynamics, emission regulations and component loads. Thermodynamics requires combustion at high temperatures in order to reach high efﬁciencies, which is compulsory to minimize fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, high temperatures promote the formation of harmful nitrogen ox- ides, shortly NOx, and require advanced cooling concepts for all parts of the machine that are in contact with the hot gases. It was found that these requirements are best met relying on lean premixed combustion, which allows for a well controllable and homogeneous combustion process at high power densities. Gas turbine manufactur- ers, however, have to pay dearly for these beneﬁcial properties since it turned out that such devices are prone to thermoacoustic oscillations. Keeping them under control is still one of the major challenges gas turbine industry has to face today. In doing so, several strategies have been followed. On the one hand, damping devices where developed, which, ideally, can calm already existing noisy combustors without having to redesign big parts of them. One example for such a device is depicted in Fig. 2 b. Here, the back plate of an annular combustion chamber is shown, where the big black holes represent the burners through which the fresh mixture is injected into CONTENTS (a) (b) Figure 2: (a) : Modern gas turbine as used for the generation of electrical power (taken from ). (b): Back plate of a annular combustion chamber with burners (big black holes). The smaller black holes next to the burners are Helmholtz dampers (taken from ). the chamber. Additionally, smaller black holes are visible, which are the entrances to connected cavities placed behind the plate. Each hole/cavity assembly forms a damping device denoted as Helmholtz damper, which signiﬁcantly reduce pulsation amplitudes occurring during engine operation. On the other hand, instead of improving existing designs, it is desirable to include thermoacoustic considerations already in early stages of the design process of a new machine. T o this end, a fun- damental understanding of all processes involved has to be generated and, based on the insights gained, tools need to be developed that allow for reliable low-order based thermoacoustic stability analyses. In the best case, this helps to avoid expensive test series as they were, for example, conducted for the F-1 engine. The Role of the Flame in Thermoacoustic Stability Analysis Many harmful combustion instabilities are low-frequency phenomena. For gas tur- bines, the associated frequency range can roughly be speciﬁed to 100 − 500 Hz. CONTENTS Figure 3: Sketch of a gas turbine combustor (top) and its associated network model (bottom). Marked in red is the intrinsic feedback loop. At these frequencies, the acoustic ﬁeld inside the combustor can in good approxima- tion be assumed to be one-dimensional. Therefore, such systems exhibit essentially longitudinal modes resulting from planar acoustic waves. Note that annular com- bustion chambers may also show azimuthal acoustic modes in this frequency range, which shall not be discussed here. Low-order modeling concepts developed to ana- lyze such longitudinal modes are referred to as network models and are usually struc- tured as depicted in Fig. 3. In the top of this ﬁgure, a typical gas turbine combustor is sketched: fresh mixture is supplied through a plenum, which feeds the premixed gases through a swirler (crossed box) into the combustion chamber where they are burned. The hot products are then emitted to the environment (or the turbine) through a converging nozzle. The lower half of the ﬁgure shows a network model representing the 1 D-acoustics of the model combustor mentioned before. Each element represents a speciﬁc part of the real device, such as a plain duct, a change in cross-sectional area, a boundary condition or the ﬂame. The dynamics of the ﬂame are hereby described by the ﬂame transfer function (FTF) which connects acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations upstream of the ﬂame to variations of the global heat release rate. This again is fed into the network model as an acoustic source. Following Fig. 3, a ﬂame can be viewed as a P A system: It captures sound at a spe- ciﬁc position, similar to what a microphone does, ampliﬁes and phase changes the recorded signals and emits them at a different location, just like a speaker 1. What becomes clear from this analogy is that the heat source establishes a feedback cycle, which may become unstable and lead to a self-oscillatory state. One possible cycle, the so-called intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback cycle [21–23], is marked in red in Fig. 3. In the case of a P A system — or a Rijke tube as mentioned above — such a state manifests itself as a loud screech. If that happens, usually either the position 1 Note that premixed ﬂames “listen” to velocity ﬂuctuations while most microphones capture pres- sure ﬂuctuations. The analogy presented here should hence not be taken literally! CONTENTS of the microphone is changed or the gain of the ampliﬁer is reduced in order to get rid of this perturbing sound. In the case of a gas turbine combustor, consequences of a developed self-oscillatory state are more severe and might — in the worst case — even lead to system failure, similar to what has been shown above for the F-1 rocket engine. The main leverage for counteracting such a state is the FTF, which can, for example, be modiﬁed by changing the mass ﬂux or the air-to-fuel ratio. Since the ﬂame is the driving force of a combustion instability, understanding its dynamics is crucial. Having powerful low-order models at hand that allow adequate predictions of the ﬂame dynamics would signiﬁcantly enhance stability predictions, particularly in early stages of the design process of a full combustor or a damping system. T o this end, a profound understanding of interactions between acoustics and a ﬂame needs to be established. This is not an easy task, considering that even a Rijke tube, where a heated mesh instead of a ﬂame acts as a heat source, exhibits non trivial behavior. Although there are many studies that have already dealt with this topic, the ﬂame response to acoustic perturbations is not yet adequately understood - even for the simple case of a Bunsen ﬂame and low forcing amplitudes (linear regime). Thus, it seems to be a good idea to focus on these setups ﬁrst before advancing to even more complex, turbulent ﬂames, as used in gas turbine combustors. Objective and Outline of the Thesis The ultimate goal of this work is to advance the understanding and modeling of the response of burner-stabilized laminar ﬂames to acoustic perturbations. The behav- ior of the global heat release rate is of particular interest, since its ﬂuctuations are proportional to the sound generated by a ﬂame, which is an important quantity in thermoacoustic analysis. T o this end, instructive low-order models shall be devel- oped and extended, which allow to bring order into the analysis of acoustics-ﬂame interactions. In the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics, there is a lack of ﬁrst principle-based, low-order mod- eling concepts for the linear ﬂame response expressed by the ﬂame transfer function (FTF), see Fig. 3. As will be detailed in the course of this work, the most wide- spread models all rely on the assumption of convective velocity perturbations, which is based on experimental observations instead of a rigorous derivation starting from ﬁrst principles. Although they allow for reasonable FTF predictions relying on em- pirical parameters (they are useful. ), they are not suitable for the analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms (. but not instructive ). Based on this realization, this thesis starts with a review of the literature on the dy- namics of laminar ﬂames. A lot has been achieved in this ﬁeld, however, only a rather small fraction of the gathered knowledge has made its way to the ﬁeld of thermoa- coustics. A similar statement can be made concerning the ﬁeld of aero-acoustics, which deals with the generation and attenuation of acoustic energy in ﬂows without CONTENTS chemical reactions. Elaborate models for the transient acoustic ﬁeld inside a con- ﬁnement or the process of vortex shedding have been developed here, which would qualify as candidates for low-order descriptions of the velocity ﬁeld in the vicin- ity of an acoustically perturbed anchored ﬂame. Again, rather few concepts made it to the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics. This thesis tries to account for the inherently inter- disciplinary nature of thermoacoustics and strives to bring together knowledge and methods from the ﬁelds of laminar premixed combustion and aero-acoustics. The work is split into three parts: Part I provides a review of the literature on the dynamics of acoustically perturbed laminar premixed ﬂames. Chap. 1 deals with the fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary. Correspondingly, the wide-spread G-equation modeling concept is introduced. Based on these results, Chap. 2 extents the scope and focuses on the dynamics and low-order modeling strategies of acoustically perturbed burner-stabilized ﬂames. Part II analyzes interactions between acoustic perturbations with burner-stabilized ﬂames relying on a new ﬁrst principle-based low-order modeling concept. The analysis is split into primary and secondary interactions, motivated by the char- acteristics of the ﬂame response to an impulsively acoustic forcing: At the very moment the impulse hits the ﬂame, its behavior is well described neglecting ﬂame-ﬂow feedback (primary interactions). At later times, the ﬂame dynamics are no longer directly governed by acoustics but by the dynamics of the individ- ual ﬂame sheets, which particularly includes ﬂame-ﬂow feedback (secondary interactions). These secondary mechanisms have severe consequences for the FTF leading to gains signiﬁcantly exceeding unity and are hence important. Part III analyzes the implications the choice of a speciﬁc burner conﬁguration has for the linear acoustic ﬂame response. While the literature mostly reports on Bun- sen ﬂames, Part II analyzed the dynamics of Slit ﬂame conﬁgurations due to their simpler analytical treatment. Hence, the questions arises how the results obtained in Part II could be generalized. Chap. 6 seeks to provide an answer by investigating consequences of ﬂame geometry for the linear acoustic ﬂame response. In the course of this study, an extension to the convective velocity model is proposed relying on Gaussian kernel functions, which particularly improves response predictions of Slit ﬂames. The contents of the work are summarized in Fig. 4, which contains a collection of the key ideas of each chapter. This overview is not meant to be self-explanatory, but rather to assist the reading process of this thesis. CONTENTS Figure 4: Contents of the thesis in a nutshell. Part I Literature Review on Acoustics-Flame Interactions This thesis seeks to analyze and model interactions between acoustics and laminar lean premixed ﬂames. A well-established method to efﬁ- ciently assess the dynamics of such ﬂames avoiding the need to deal with chemical reactions relies on a kinematic description: the usually thin ﬂame sheets are viewed as gasdynamic discontinuities that prop- agate normal to themselves with a characteristic speed. Their dynam- ics are hereby governed by consequences of density changes across the ﬂame sheets as well as by dependencies of the ﬂame speed on various ge- ometrical and mixture properties. This approach became state-of-the-art and, thus, the literature review provided in this Part of the thesis revolves around this key concept. Chap. 1 introduces the fundamental dynamics of freely propagating ﬂame sheets. Four canonical mechanisms are identiﬁed and explicated that govern ﬂame propagation. Most low-order modeling concepts are based on the so-called G-equation approach, which is subsequently dis- cussed. Relying on these ideas, Chap. 2 then moves on to the more re- alistic setups of burner-stabilized ﬂames. Here, driven by the thermoa- coustics focus of this work, their interactions with acoustic perturbations are emphasized. The phenomenological convective velocity model is in- troduced, which is, combined with the G-equation framework, the state- of-the-art low-order model of such systems. 1 Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets A literature review on the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary is provided, ranging from (i) a discussion on the internal ﬂame structure, over (ii) an outline of four important canonical mechanisms of ﬂame propagation to (iii) associated low- order modeling concepts. Premixed laminar ﬂame fronts are often assumed to be thin with respect to a charac- teristic length of the considered problem, such as the overall ﬂame length or a per- turbation wave length. This approximation allows for a purely kinematic treatment of their spatio-temporal behavior avoiding detailed considerations of ﬂame-internal chemical and transport processes that govern the combustion process. A description of the complete dynamics boils down to an expression for the ﬂame propagation velocity as well as jump conditions, connecting macroscopic properties of the ﬂuid up- and downstream of the ﬂame. This simpliﬁed treatment enables analytical stud- ies on the dynamics of planar ﬂame sheets and allows to identify the physical key mechanisms. Hence, it constitutes one of the central concepts when dealing with the dynamics of premixed ﬂame fronts. Accordingly, this chapter introduces the relevant ﬁndings and observations required to understand the key motivations and theoretical concepts associated to this idea. For the sake of clearness, this chapter is limited to the study of freely propagating thin ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary. Burner-stabilized ﬂames are only in- troduced in the subsequent chapter as an extension to the theory introduced here. Sec. 1.01 speciﬁes the term “thin” in the context of a lean methane-air ﬂame and pro- vides a historical review of important experiments and theoretical achievements in the ﬁeld. Subsequently, the four main governing mechanisms for the dynamics of lean methane-air ﬂame sheets are summarized in Sec 1.02. Finally, Sec 1.03 introduces the G-equation or level-set method as well as a 1 D linearized advection-diffusion equation, which are both widely used modeling approach in order to efﬁciently cap- ture the dynamics of ﬂame sheets. Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets 1.01 Scope The overview presented in the following clariﬁes when a ﬂame front is considered to be “thin” and how the analysis of such ﬂames evolved, starting from the early works of Darrieus and Landau. This section is not strictly limited to ﬁnd- ings directly related to the main topic of this thesis, but rather seeks to provide a more comprehensive view. Readers who are only interested in the main mechanisms governing the dynamics of ﬂame sheets, may skip this section for now and directly continue with Sec 1.02. 1.01.01 Deﬁnition of the T erm “Thin Flame” The overall combustion process of lean methane-oxygen mixtures to carbon dioxide and water involves tens of chemical sub-reactions and the formation of hundreds of intermediate species. Peters and Williams systematically reduced these for sufﬁciently high pressures and temperatures to only three global reactions that involve six species: CH 4 + O 2 → CO + H 2 + H 2 O (1.01) CO + H 2 O ⇋ CO 2 + H 2 (1.02) O 2 + 2 H 2 → 2 H 2 O. (1.03) Fig. 1.01 illustrates the inner structure of such an adiabatic, lean methane-air ﬂame of equivalence ratioφ = 0.081. Three characteristic layers are identiﬁed : (i) An inert convective-diffusive layer of thickness δD where the fresh mixture is preheated and methane molecules are transported towards the reaction zone. (ii) A thin reaction layer of extensionδR where methane CH 4 and oxygen O 2 react to carbon monoxide CO, hydrogen H 2 and water H 2 O, as expressed by Reaction (1.01). (iii) A second reaction layer of thickness δO where hydrogen and carbon monoxide are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, see Reactions (1.02) and (1.03). The reaction zone can be visualized by the heat release rate˙q, which is a conse- quence of the transformation of chemically stored enthalpy of the products to sen- sible enthalpy via the three global exothermic oxidation reactions. The heat release rate is plotted in Fig. 1.01 and it is apparent that the reaction layer associated with the global Reaction (1.01) has a much thinner spatial extension than the one of the sec- ondary oxidation zone associated with the global Reactions (1.02) and (1.03). This is reﬂected by different activation energies, which are signiﬁcantly higher for the global Reaction (1.01) than for the Reaction (1.02). The latter is also known as the moderately exothermic water-gas shift reaction and, compared to Reaction (1.01), only adds a secondary contribution to the total heat release rate. It, however, leads to the for- mation of hydrogen that is ﬁnally oxidized by Reaction (1.03). All in all, due to the 1 Computed with Cantera using the GRI-Mech 3.00 reaction mechanism 1.01 Scope Figure 1.01: Internal structure of a lean methane-air ﬂame of equivalence ratio φ = 0.08. All curves are normalized by their maximum value. dominance of Reaction (1.01), the combustion of methane-air mixtures is essentially a very localized process. Based on the insight that this also holds for a variety of mixtures, where the combus- tion process is conﬁned to a layer that is thin compared to a global length scale — such as the burner mouth diameter – ﬂames are often approximated as gas dynamic discontinuities, i. e. surfaces separating cold reactants from hot products [26, 27, 33– 35]. Far away from this discontinuity, ﬂuid composition, temperature and density are essentially constant. The dynamics of the ﬂame sheet is governed by a local consumption speed, which deﬁnes a propagation velocity of the ﬂame normal to it- self and relative to the fresh mixture, quantiﬁed by the ﬂame speed. This speed is a manifestation of chemical reactions and transport processes in the reaction and the convective-diffusive layer, respectively [34–37]. Models that regard a ﬂame as a discontinuity are speciﬁcally designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of a reacting ﬂow, while the formation of pollutants or any other chemical property of the combustion process are neglected. In order to retrieve a closed formulation of such ﬂow problems, a ﬂame speed and jump conditions, con- necting up- and downstream ﬂow quantities, need to be speciﬁed at the surface repre- senting the ﬂame. They were derived from ﬁrst principles by use of matched asymp- totic expansion methods, which exploit the fact that ﬂames exhibit length scales of different order. Each scale has its own characteristic properties, which allows to drop speciﬁc terms from the full set of governing equations. By asymptotically matching the results of the individual length scales, a macroscopic description of the internal processes could be derived, which essentially boils down to an expression for the desired ﬂame speed and the jump conditions, see e. g. [28, 34, 35, 37–41]. Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets In order to apply these matched asymptotic expansion methods, characteristic length scales associated with the available internal layers need to be found. Based on them, non-dimensional parameters are deﬁned that are used to derive the respective govern- ing equation for each layer. In the case of premixed combustion, the relative thickness of the convective-diffusive boundary layerδD, see Fig. 1.01, is quantiﬁed by a Péclet number Pe = L δD, (1.04) which relates a typical length scale of the macroscopic (or outer) ﬂow problem L, to a length scale of the microscopic (or inner) advection-diffusion problem. Here, the outer problem may be characterized by the burner diameter or the perturbation wave length of interest and the inner problem by a diffusion lengthδD = D /s L, where s L is the ﬂame speed and D either the thermal diffusivity D t h or the mass diffusivity of the deﬁcient species relative to the fresh mixture D Y. Both diffusivities are related by the Lewis number Le = D t h D Y, (1.05) where the thermal diffusivity is deﬁned by D t h = λ/(ρcp ) with the thermal conduc- tivity λ, the density ρ and the speciﬁc heat capacity for constant pressure cp, all evaluated for the fresh mixture. If D t h = D Y and thus Le = 1 holds, the thermal and the species boundary layer are identical. Otherwise, one of them outweighs the other. Lean methane-air ﬂames, as considered in this thesis, typically have Lewis numbers very close unity, which is also reﬂected in the similar boundary layer thicknesses of CH 4 and temperature ahead of the reaction zone shown in Fig. 1.01. Hence, the Lewis number quantiﬁes the coupling of species transport and energy equation, similarly as the Prandtl number does it for momentum and energy. For the Le≈ 1 case, typically the thermal, instead of the mass, diffusion length scale δD = D t h/s L is used in order to quantify the extension of the preheat layer. The thickness of the reaction layerδR is related to the Zeldovich number Ze = E a Rg Tb Tb − Tu Tb (1.06) with the activation energy of the global chemical reaction E a, the gas constant Rg and the temperatures of the unburned and burned ﬂuid Tu and Tb, respectively. High activation energies, and hence Ze ≫ 1, lead to thin reaction layers. Using these deﬁnitions, the spatial extension of the convective-diffusive layer is of orderδD = O ( Pe−1 ) and the one of the two reaction zones of order δR /O = O ( Pe−1 Ze−1 ). For the ﬂame conﬁgurations considered in this the- sis (lean methane-air mixtures at φ ≈ 0.08 and burner inlet radii of Ri = 5 mm ), we retrieve a Péclet number of the order O (100). Hence, all ﬂames can safely be consid- ered as thin ﬂame sheets. 1.01 Scope Figure 1.02: Cellular structure of a ﬂat ﬂame for n-butane-air-nitrogen mixtures at four different ambient pressures (photos taken from ). 1.01.02 Historical Background Approximating thin ﬂames as discontinuities separating two ﬂow domains of con- stant chemical composition and density made an efﬁcient analysis of combustion problems possible. Numerical investigations became affordable and, particularly, the way to analytical studies was paved. Of speciﬁc interest was the analysis of freely propagating planar ﬂames in order to retrieve closed analytical expressions for the ﬂame propagation speed, which then allowed for a detailed analysis of ﬂame front dynamics and, particularly, their stability. The works of Darrieus and Landau were among the ﬁrst to analytically study the stability of thin planar ﬂame fronts. They regarded the ﬂame as a discontinuity propagating at a constant ﬂame speeds L with respect to the fresh ﬂow and imposed continuous mass and momentum ﬂuxes through the ﬂame sheet leading to a set of jump conditions [ ρ ( u⊥ − ∂ξ ∂t )] b u = 0, [ p + ρ ( u⊥ − ∂ξ ∂t ) u⊥ ] b u = 0, [ u∥ ] b u= 0 (1.07) that connect quantities of the unburned (“u”) to those of the burned (“b”) side of the ﬂame, see also. The squared brackets denote the change of a quantity across the ﬂame front:[∗]b u= ∗b − ∗u. The ﬁrst equation results from the conservation of mass, the second and third from the conservation of ﬂame normal (index “ ⊥”) and tangential (index “ ∥”) momentum, respectively. V elocities are denoted by the letter u, the density by ρ and the pressure by p. The displacement of the ﬂame from its steady state is given by ξ = ξ(x, t ), where x denotes a direction parallel to the ﬂame front and t the time. For a given ﬂame normal ﬂow velocity u⊥ = u⊥(x, t ), the ﬂame front moves according to ∂ξ ∂t = u⊥ − s L. Solving a system of linearized Euler equations up- and downstream the ﬂame that are coupled via the jump conditions (1.07), Landau obtained a dispersion relation stating that the growth rate of a ﬂame perturbation increases linearly with wavenum- ber. That means that ﬂat ﬂames were unconditionally unstable to perturbations of any wave length caused by the density jump imposed at the ﬂame front. This result, however, is inconsistent with experimental observations reporting that it Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets is indeed possible to stabilize ﬂat planar ﬂames, see e. g. [44–47]. Further, it is in con- ﬂict with observations made by Markstein, who showed that a ﬂat ﬂame develops cellular structures whose averaged cell size decreases with rising ambient pressure, see Fig. 1.02. While the theory of Landau predicts a linear increase of growth rate with the wave number, the experimental results of Markstein reported a pressure dependent uniform cell size, which suggests the existence of a pressure de- pendent maximum growth rate at a wave number approximately corresponding to the observed cell sizes (approximately since the observed cellular structures are already affected by non-linear processes, see ). Noticing that the theory of Landau was restricted to disturbances whose wave length is large compared to the thickness of the ﬂame and that the thickness of a ﬂame decreases with pressure (lower pressure→ thicker ﬂame → lager average size of the cellular structures), Markstein introduced the ad hoc hypotheses of a ﬂame speed that depends on the local ﬂame front mean curvatureκf : s L = s 0 L (1 − l M κf ). (1.08) Here, the Markstein length l M is computed from the characteristic length of the convective-diffusive layer δD = λu /(s L ρu cp,u ) and the Markstein number Ma, which typically is of order unity: l M = δD Ma. Following the ideas of Karlovitz et al and Eckhaus, Markstein extended his phenomenological theory by includ- ing ﬂow strain as a second source of ﬂame stretchκs = 1/ A(d A/dt ) and related it to the Markstein number, as well: s L = s 0 L [ 1 − Ma ( lc κf + 1 s L n f · ∇u · n f )], (1.09) where n f is a vector normal to the ﬂame front and ∇u the strain rate tensor of the upstream ﬂow. According to Markstein, the lack of knowledge concerning combustion reac- tions and the reaction-kinetic terms prevented a rigorous derivation of the ﬂame speed relations from ﬁrst principles. Subsequent studies were able to close this gap and could derive the phenomenological ﬂame stretch terms from ﬁrst principles, see e. g. [34, 35, 37, 39–41, 51]. These studies are based on the aforementioned matched asymptotic methods exploiting the fact that hydrodynamic length scales are much larger than the length scales of the convective-diffusive boundary layer and the reac- tion zone. This approach is brieﬂy sketched in the following. Studies relying on matched asymptotic expansions are based on the consideration of two coupled ﬂow domains of different length scales. The large scaleouter hydrody- namic model, on the one hand, consists of two incompressible ﬂuid domains coupled via jump conditions at a ﬂow discontinuity representing the ﬂame. The small scale innerreaction model, on the other hand, is represented by a low Mach number ﬂow where density depends on temperature only and chemical reactions are usually dom- inated by a single deﬁcient component (1-step chemistry). Later studies such as the 1.01 Scope one by Matalon et al included a 2-step mechanism allowing for consideration of mixtures whose composition varies from rich to lean conditions. The outer and the inner models are matched by assuming that their solutions have to coincide far away from the ﬂame, which results in expressions for the ﬂame speed and the jump conditions. Flame speed relations, as well as the deﬁnition of the Markstein number, generally depend on the exact location of the discontinuity with respect to the inner ﬂame structure [37, 41, 52–54]. By constraining the mass ﬂux of the outer solution to be continuous at the discontinuity, Classet al naturally ﬁxed the position of the ﬂame and, thus, the expressions for the ﬂame speed as well as the Markstein number. All those studies derived jump conditions similar to the one shown in Eq. (1.07), but they extended the analysis by considering higher order terms of the respective expan- sion parameters. Furthermore, they also obtained expressions for the ﬂame speed that solely rely on macroscopic or combustion intrinsic/thermophysical parameters. For example, Matalonet al speciﬁed s L = s 0 L ( 1 − 1 Pe Ma κs ) (1.010) with a Markstein number Ma = 1 1 − ˆe ∫ 1/ ˆe λ∗(x ) x dx + Ze ( Lee f f − 1 ) ˆe 2 (1 − ˆe ) ∫ 1/ ˆe λ∗(x ) x ln ( 1 − ˆe ˆe (x − 1) ) dx, (1.011) where ˆe = ρb /ρu denotes the burned to the unburned density ratio, λ∗ = λ/λu and Lee f f the normalized thermal conductivity and the effective Lewis number of the mixture, respectively. The ﬂame speed is hence related to ﬂame stretch κs, which is composed of ﬂame curvature and ﬂow strain, via a Markstein number. Therefore, the aforementioned ad hoc hypothesis of Markstein that the ﬂame speed depends on ﬂame curvature could indeed be conﬁrmed by rigorous ﬁrst-principle-based analyses of the ﬂame internal structure. Once the jump conditions and the ﬂame speed relation is known, a stability analysis of ﬂame sheets can be performed, which results in a dispersion relation. This topic is discussed in more detail in Sec. 1.02. V arious types of ﬂame conﬁgurations have been investigated in the literature trying to validate the theoretically retrieved ﬂame speed relations, stability predictions and/or determine ﬂame parameters such as the Markstein length. Most theoretical studies were performed for 2 D planar or ﬂat ﬂames since the analysis simpliﬁes for such conﬁgurations. Experimental investigations of such ﬂames, however, are not straight forward since stabilization requires an active stabilization loop and/or elabo- rate ignition methods. Heat losses to nearby walls further complicate the analysis of the results. Hence, many experimental studies focused on different conﬁgurations such as spher- ical bombs. Here, a mixture of fuel and oxidizer is ignited by a spark that causes a radially expanding deﬂagration front. In order to ensure a negligible increases of the pressure in the combustor during the combustion process, the volume of the com- bustion chamber of the test rig has to be large compared to the one of the burned Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets Figure 1.03: Snapshots of spherically expanding stoichiometric propane/air ﬂames (spherical bombs) for three different ambient pressures at a Lewis num- ber close to unity. The snapshots compare instants in time of the same non-dimensional stretch rate, deﬁned by the Karlovitz number Ka (snap- shots are taken from ). mixture. Advantages of such test rigs are the relatively simple adjustment of exper- imental parameters such as pressure and temperature of the mixture, the absence of initial turbulence in the unburned ﬂuid and a well deﬁned and uniformly distributed ﬂame stretch. In particular, the latter property qualiﬁes these conﬁgurations for measurements of Markstein numbers and laminar ﬂame speeds [58–61], as well as for the assessment of ﬂame front instabilities. Fig. 1.03, for example, shows experimental results of Kwonet al. They investi- gated the development of spherically expanding stoichiometric propane/air ﬂame at three ambient pressures. By variation of pressure, they changed the ﬂame thickness (higher pressure→ thinner ﬂames), while all other parameters inﬂuencing ﬂame sta- bility were kept approximately constant. The higher the ambient pressure and, thus, the thinner the ﬂame, the less stable the expanding ﬂame front becomes: Similarly to the experimental results of Markstein shown in Fig. 1.02, a lower pressure in- creases stability and successively less “cracks” – indicating the formation of growing cellular structures – are visible in Fig 1.03 comparing the 10 bar, 5 bar and the 2 bar series of snapshots. Finally, aerodynamically anchored ﬂames such as Bunsen or Slit ﬂames constitute another important ﬂame conﬁguration of high technical relevance. Since for such ﬂames local displacements are convected downstream, ﬂame instabilities cause spa- tially growing displacements, as depicted in experiments carried out by Searbyet al and reproduced in Fig 1.04. Several studies have analyzed such conﬁgurations and found that, besides the advection of ﬂame front displacements and the existence of 1.01 Scope Figure 1.04: Snapshot of an aerodynamically anchored and inclined rich propane/air/oxygen ﬂame whose base is displaced by a vibrating ﬂame holder (taken from ). a ﬂame anchoring and tip, the dynamics of anchored and inclined ﬂames essentially corresponds to the one of the planar counterpart, i. e. the same instability mechanisms are present [45, 64–66]. Such type of ﬂames are investigated within the scope of this thesis. Formally, they will only be introduced in the following chapter. Having solved the linear stability problem of planar ﬂames for many canonical con- ﬁgurations, the next step was to assess the process of non-linear saturation. For this purpose, on the one hand, Navier-Stokes based simulations treating the ﬂame as a gas dynamic discontinuity [67–70] have been performed. On the other, a low-order weakly non-linear ﬂame model, known as the Michelson-Sivashinsky (MS) equa- tion, has been introduced. It has been proven to be a valuable tool for the prediction of the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities and their fully non-linear development. The dynamics of the MS equation on a ﬁnite domain of width L is controlled by a reduced Markstein number αM = l M /(ρu /ρb − 1)L. For sufﬁciently small values of this parameter, short wave length ﬂame front displacements perpet- ually coalesce forming bigger and bigger structures until, eventually, a stable single peak solution is reached. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1.05 where a randomly perturbed ﬂame sheet (top line) develops into a stable cusp (bottom line), which con- tinues to propagate at a constant speed. Instabilities, such as the ones described above, are responsible for many crucial and practically relevant ﬂow phenomena and often result in characteristic large-scale co- herent structures. There are, for example, the widely known Kelvin-Helmholtz in- stability or the T ollmien–Schlichting waves. Both lead to the formation of ﬂow fea- tures that have several important consequences for technical applications, such as pipe ﬂows or the ﬂow around airplane wings. Accordingly, stability considerations have made their way to the analysis of ﬂames in a thermoacoustic context, as well. Here, technically relevant setups often rely on swirl-stabilized turbulent ﬂames. One important feature of these ﬂames is a precessing vortex core that responds to acous- tics and signiﬁcantly interacts with the combustion process [73–75], another the oc- currence of a so-called vortex breakdown [76–78]. Both mechanisms are related to ﬂow ﬁeld instabilities and essentially determine the ﬂame response to acoustic per- turbations. Exploiting this principal ﬁnding, Oberleithneret al and Oberleithner Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets Figure 1.05: T emporal evolution of a randomly perturbed ﬂame sheet according to the MS equation forαM = 0.0005. Several snapshots of the same ﬂame front at different times are shown, where time progresses from the top to the bottom line (taken from ). and Paschereit developed a method that is capable to adequately predict the fre- quency and amplitude dependent ﬂame response based on a linear stability analysis of the underlying mean ﬂow. It can hence be concluded that the understanding and consideration of the relevant instability mechanisms constitutes one important pre- requisite in order to correctly interpret and model the complex ﬂow behavior of both laminar and turbulent ﬂames. The dynamics and stability of thin ﬂame fronts has historically been classiﬁed ac- cording to a variety of non-dimensional numbers. The Markstein number has already been mentioned above and quantiﬁes the effect of stretch (curvature and ﬂow strain) onto the ﬂame speed. It usually is of order O (1), and large positive Markstein num- bers indicate stable ﬂames. Note that its deﬁnition depends on the assumed location of the gas dynamic discontinuity representing the ﬂame with respect to the inner ﬂame structure. Often it is assumed that it coincides with the reaction layer, see e. g. A second important number is the Lewis number Le, which relates the thermal to the mass diffusivity of the deﬁcient species relative to the mixture. The experimental data shown in Fig. 1.03 was obtained at unity Lewis number. The fact that thermal and mass diffusion are approximately equal prevents the occurrence of thermo-diffusive and pulsating instabilities. The former will be discussed in Sec. 1.02.02. Another impor- tant non-dimensional number is the Karlovitz number, which quantiﬁes ﬂame stretch: Ka = 2δf s 0 L R f d R d t, (1.012) 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation where R f is the ﬂame radius, t the time, δf the ﬂame thickness and s 0 L the unstretched ﬂame speed. The snapshots of the spherical bombs shown in Fig. 1.03 are taken at dis- tinct Karlovitz numbers for all three pressure levels. As mentioned above, stretched ﬂames are less prone to develop instabilities than unstretched ones. An expanding spherical ﬂame increases its radius and, hence, the ﬂame front is exposed to suc- cessively decreasing stretch. By comparing snapshots of constant Ka, the effect of different pressure dependent stretch levels on stability can be eliminated. Finally, ﬂames usually propagate in the gravitational ﬁeld of the earth. For ﬂames whose associated ﬂow direction points upwards (heavy unburned mixture below light burned products), gravity tends to stabilize perturbations of long wave lengths. The impact of gravity relative to the ﬂame speed is given by a Froude num- ber Fr = s 2 L /(g δf ) with the gravitational acceleration g. As pointed out by Searby and Clavin, for a given mixture there exists a critical value of the Froude number Frc below which planar ﬂames are unconditionally stable. The wave length of the pertur- bations that become unstable at Frc is large compared to the ﬂame thickness. The effect of gravity together with the effect of ﬂame curvature explains why it is possi- ble to experimentally implement stable planar ﬂame fronts. Flames with a ﬂow streaming downwards (light burned products below heavy unburned mixture) are destabilized by the Rayleigh-T aylor instability. 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation In the previous section it was shown that the representation of a ﬂame as a propa- gating discontinuity connecting the unburned with the burned ﬂow domain by means of jump conditions provides an efﬁcient tool for understanding and modeling the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets. First principle-based expressions for the propagation speed as well as jump conditions could be derived by means of matched asymp- totic expansion techniques. While the latter ensure the conservation of mass, normal and tangential momentum across the ﬂame, the former emerges as a consequence of chemical kinetics combined with the energy and species transport. One important outcome of this kind of analysis is that the local ﬂame speed depends on ﬂame stretch, i. e. ﬂame curvature and ﬂow strain. Coupling two incompressible ﬂow domains of different densities using aforemen- tioned jump conditions and ﬂame speed relations results in an powerful framework for the analysis of the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets. Its main advantage consists in the fact that the chemical details of the combustion process need no longer to be considered and, thus, the focus is shifted to macroscopic quantities, such as the ﬂame speed or the ﬂame shape. This method consequently brings order into the complex ﬁeld of ﬂame propagation and allows to differentiate between well-deﬁned intuitively accessible governing mechanisms. The within the scope of this thesis four most important mechanisms are discussed in Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets the following. Each one is in a ﬁrst step formally introduced and subsequently its im- plications are illustrated by analyzing how it affects the dynamics of a perturbed ﬂame sheet. Section 1.02.01 deals with the most elementary mechanism of ﬂame propagation, namely the fact that ﬂame sheets propagate normal to themselves. Section 1.02.02 an- alyzes thermal-diffusive mechanisms that address implications of the ﬂame speed relation onto ﬂame sheet propagation. This is followed by an analysis of hydrody- namic mechanisms, which arise as soon as two ﬂow domains of different densities are coupled via jump conditions. Finally, Sec. 1.02.04 deals with ﬂame sheets that are inclined with respect to the mean ﬂow ﬁeld, e. g. by anchoring them. Here, in addi- tion to the former mechanisms, the advection of ﬂame front perturbations becomes important. 1.02.01 Propagation Normal to Itself 1 D simulations, as the one shown in Fig. 1.01, reveal that a (thin) reaction zone propa- gates into the domain of the fresh mixture at a certain speed. The velocity of the mean ﬂow ﬁeld far upstream of the ﬂame that is required to maintain the ﬂame front at a ﬁxed position is referred to as the ﬂame speeds L in the following. Note that, theoret- ically, also other deﬁnitions of s L are possible, such as the ﬂow speed far downstream of the reaction zone. Since the properties of the fresh mixture are the ones that are set by an experimentalist or at a numerical simulation, it is convenient to deﬁnes L with respect to them. Knowing how a 1 D ﬂame propagates, we are now interested in the transient behavior of a ﬂame sheet, where each point on this sheet propagates at a constant speeds L. Without loss of generality, we approach this problem by assuming a 2 D sheet that has at a timet 0 the shape as depicted by the black line in Fig. 1.06 a. Since a point of that line propagates at a speed s L, its position at a time t 0 + ∆t has to be somewhere on a circle of radius ∆t s L drawn around the current position. This has to hold for each point on the black line and, therefore, the ﬂame front position at t 0 + ∆t can only be given by the upstream envelope of all circles, depicted by the red line in Fig. 1.06 a. From this consideration, which is also known as Huygens’s principle, it naturally evolves that a ﬂame propagates normal to itself. One important consequence of this mechanism is the formation of cusps, which are perturbations of the ﬂame front of discontinuous slope. Following Huygens’s prin- ciple, it can be shown that such non-smooth ﬂame shapes develop from an initially smooth ﬂame front, which is concavely bent towards the fresh fuel mixture. Since ﬂame fronts propagate normal to themselves, the position of the ﬂame sheet at later times can be estimated by rays drawn normal to the current ﬂame front position, see Fig. 1.06 a ( ). These rays will eventually intersect and, hence, one side of the initially smooth ﬂame wrinkle propagates into the opposing front, which leads to the generation of cusps and to a propagation of the tip of the wrinkle in the direction of the unburned gases with a speed faster than the ﬂame speed. This process is 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation (a) (b) Figure 1.06: Illustration of Huygens’s Principle (1.06 a), which explains the formation of cusps from an initially smooth ﬂame front (1.06 b). illustrated for four instants in time in Fig. 1.06 b (blue arrow). On the contrary, convex parts of a ﬂame sheet will expand and heal themselves from eventual cusps. It is interesting to note that the formation of cusps constitutes a non-linear mecha- nism that leads to saturation of high amplitude perturbations, particularly for high wave numbers. Further, it is not symmetric since convex displacements are smoothed out, while concave ones form sharp edges. Hence, as pointed out by Sivashinsky, Landau eliminated a major stabilizing mechanism by linearizing all of the equations. This argument partly resolves Landau’s paradoxical prediction of uncon- ditionally unstable ﬂame fronts. This becomes more clear when considering the fact that Clanet and Searby were the ﬁrst to experimentally measure and visualize the growth of planar ﬂame front perturbations due to the Darrieus-Landau instability as late as 1998. All previous studies on planar ﬂames only measured cellular struc- tures that were already non-linearly saturated and, hence, subjected to the mechanism described above. This thesis is devoted to the study of the linear response of acoustically perturbed ﬂames. The non-linear mechanism described above leads to the formation of very characteristic ﬂame shapes that exhibit sharp edges at concave and smooth fronts at convex parts of a ﬂame sheet. Hence, it provides a simple tool to estimate if the response of a ﬂame is still in the linear regime or if non-linear processes have already started to become signiﬁcant. Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets 1.02.02 Thermal-Diffusive So far it was assumed that all points of a ﬂame sheet propagate at a constant speed. Theory, however, predicts that this speed depends on the local ﬂame stretch κs = 1/ A(d A/dt ), i. e. the normalized rate of change of the local ﬂame surface area. Flame stretch has its origin in ﬂame curvature and ﬂow strain. Since the related pro- cesses are governed by thermal as well as mass diffusion of a deﬁcient species, their consequences for the ﬂame dynamics are attributed to the so-called thermal-diffusive (or also thermodiffusive) mechanism. The decisive parameter for this mechanism is the Lewis number, which relates the thermal to the mass diffusivity of the deﬁcient species 1. It allows to distinguish be- tween several distinct regimes of ﬂame propagation: The ﬁrst consists of mixtures whose mass diffusivity of the deﬁcient component with respect to the mixture is sig- niﬁcantly higher than the thermal one. Those ﬂame fronts exhibit thermal-diffusive instabilities that cause strongly corrugated ﬂame surfaces. One example for such mix- tures are lean hydrogen-air ﬂames, e. g. Le≈ 0.04 for φ = 0.06. The second regime is deﬁned by mixtures with a Lewis number close to one, such as lean methane-air ﬂames (Le≈ 1 ), as considered in this work. Conditions with Le > 1 are usually observed in lean mixtures of heavy fuels (e. g. propane/air ) or rich mixtures of light fuels, as well as for combustion in porous media (blocked mass and enhanced thermal diffusion) or for solid propellants. These high Lewis number ﬂames show a third type of instability not considered in this work, the so-called pulsating instability. It is expected to occur for Ze(Le − 1) ≳ 10 and is — since it results from a thermal-diffusive mechanism — affected (enhanced) by ﬂame stretch [48, 90–93]. In order to suppress hydrodynamic mechanisms, which will only be discussed in the next section, it is assumed that the density of the ﬂow does not change across the ﬂame. That way consequences of thermal-diffusive mechanisms can efﬁciently be studied. In order to maintain chemical reactions inside a ﬂame, on the one hand, heat has to diffuse from the reaction zone into the fresh mixture and, in doing so, preheat it to a temperature where the (fast) combustion processes can take place. On the other hand, the deﬁcient component is diffusively transported from the unburned mixture to the reaction zone — i. e. methane molecules in the case of a lean methane-air ﬂame. Both diffusive processes together with the kinetics of the reaction deﬁne a laminar unstretched ﬂame speed, which depends on temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio of the fresh gases, see e. g. If now the ﬂame front is perturbed as illustrated in Fig. 1.07, from a geometrical point of view, the heat released at regions that are convex towards the fresh mixture has to heat up more cool reactants than in concave ones. Hence, more heat is carried away 1 Later studies relying on a matched asymptotic expansion technique analyzed a two-step instead of a one-step chemical scheme, see Matalon et al. They introduced an effective Lewis number, which is a weighted sum of the Lewis numbers of the individual species. This extension of the theory shall not be considered here. 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation Figure 1.07: Illustration of the thermal-diffusive ﬂame instability mechanism. T em- perature ﬂuxes are marked in red, mass ﬂuxes of the deﬁcient species in blue. from the reaction zone in convex regions, which therefore cool down and propagate at lower speeds than the unperturbed ﬂame. On the contrary, heat accumulates in con- cave regions, an effect that increases the local ﬂame speed. Since the ﬂow speed is constant everywhere (we presently assume constant density across the ﬂame front!), perturbations of the ﬂame sheet will be damped by this mechanism. At the same time, however, mass diffusion of the deﬁcient component is enhanced in convex and atten- uated in concave regions for analogous reasons as explicated above for temperature. This increases the ﬂame speed in convex and decreases it in concave regions and, therefore, has exactly the reverse effect of temperature diffusion: ﬂame sheet pertur- bations are further ampliﬁed. Depending on the Lewis number either one or the other mechanism dominates. At a critical Lewis number Le 0 c,TD both effects cancel each other and the ﬂame sheet is marginally stable, that is (small) perturbations neither grow (unstable) nor do they asymptotically decay (stable). An increase of mass — or decrease in heat — diffusivity leads to Le< Le 0 c,TD and, therefore, to an unstable ﬂame sheet. Conversely, a reduction of mass — or increase in heat — diffusivity causes Le> Le 0 c,TD and, thus, a stable ﬂame sheet. This phenomenon was analytically analyzed for ﬂows of constant density by Sivashinsky. Assuming an inviscid ﬂow up- and downstream the ﬂame sheet, a dispersion relation σ = D t h [ Ze 2 (1 − Le) − 1 ] k 2    long−wave disturbances − 4 D t hδ2 Dk 4    short−wave correction (1.013) was derived relating a growth rate σ to a wave vector k. Harmonic perturbations of the ﬂame sheet develop in time according to exp(σt + i k x 1 ). Thus, positive growth rates correspond to unstable, negative ones to asymptotically stable regimes. A growth rate of zero corresponds to a marginally stable ﬂame sheet. Neglecting the correction term Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets (a) growth rate over wave number (b) growth rate over wave length Figure 1.08: Dispersion relation of Eq. (1.013) for the thermal-diffusive instability mechanism plotted over non-dimensional wave number (1.08 a) and wave length (1.08 b) for several Lewis numbers Le∈ [0.05, 1]. The one for Le 0 c,TD ≈ 0.07 is highlighted in red ( ). Additionally, for the two shown extreme Lewis numbers dispersion relations neglecting the short-wave number correction term are plotted ( ). in Eq. (1.013), one can compute a critical Lewis number Le 0 c,TD = 1 − 2 Ze−1 for which the growth rate is at maximum zero, i. e. σ ≤ 0, ∀k. The short-wave correction in Eq. (1.013) accounts for the fact that perturbations with a wave length that is of the order of the preheat zone thicknessδD are damped by diffusion since boundary layers of two adjacent ﬂame wrinkles overlap and merge. Using Eq. (1.013), dispersion relations such as the one shown in Fig. 1.08 are retrieved. Fig. 1.08 a shows the growth rate over the non-dimensional wave numberk ∗ = k δD and Fig. 1.08 b the one over the non-dimensional wave length λ∗ = λ/δD. By using the ﬂame thickness δD as reference length, it is recognized that wave lengths of the order O (δD ) are damped (i. e. the growth rate is negative) for all Lewis numbers shown. The dispersion relation corresponding to the critical Lewis number Le 0 c,TD is highlighted in red ( ). Dispersion relations of higher and lower Lewis number, respectively, are shown by the gray lines (darker shades correspond to lower Le). The blue dashed line ( ) corresponds to the two extreme Le cases neglecting the short-wave correction term. The critical Lewis number evaluates to Le 0 c,TD ≲ 0.08 for lean methane-air mixtures. Since such ﬂames have Lewis numbers of approximately unity, thermal-diffusive mechanisms do not lead to a growth of ﬂame front perturbations, but rather dampen existing ones. Hence, they stabilize a ﬂame front by damping existing disturbances, which is especially important when considering that hydrodynamic mechanisms re- sulting from a change of density across the ﬂame always have a destabilizing effect. They counteract each other, as will be shown in the following section. 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation (a) (b) Figure 1.09: (a) : Since the ﬂow across the ﬂame front is accelerated in ﬂame normal direction, velocity vectors are bend towards the ﬂame normal direction downstream a ﬂame.(b): Illustration of contracting (red) and expand- ing (blue) ﬂow tubes due to a displaced ﬂame front, which explain the occurrence of the Darrieus-Landau instability. 1.02.03 Hydrodynamic As discussed in Sec. 1.01, according to the seminal work of Darrieus and Landau, a change in density across the ﬂame sheet destabilizes planar ﬂames for per- turbation wave lengths that are much longer than the ﬂame thickness. In honor of its two discoverers, this instability is referred to as the Darrieus-Landau (DL) instabil- ity in the literature. The intensity of this mechanism is proportional to the prevailing density change across the ﬂame sheet, which is quantiﬁed by the non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume E = ρu ρb − 1. (1.014) The ﬁrst term in this expression is also referred to as the expansion ratio e = ρu /ρb. Since all ﬂames covered in this thesis produce a signiﬁcant change in density of E≈ 5.07, it can be expected that the DL mechanism plays an important role for their dynamics. Before assessing the problem analytically, a qualitative description shall be provided. A planar, perturbed ﬂame front stabilized in a uniform ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 1.09 b is assumed. Due to the density jump across the ﬂame front, the upstream ﬂowuu is accelerated in ﬂame normal direction, as illustrated in Fig. 1.09 a. The tangential com- ponent stays constant. This leads to a bending of the ﬂow vector towards the local ﬂame normal direction. Consequently, in regions where the ﬂame front is concave towards the fresh mixture, the ﬂow tubes are contracted, while they expand in con- Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets vex ones. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.09 b by red (contraction) and blue (expansion) ﬂow tubes. Assuming that the ﬂame speed is not affected by stretch, in red regions, the local ﬂow speed will outweigh the ﬂame speed and the ﬂame front is transported further downstream. This will lead to an increase in amplitude of the ﬂame displace- ment. In blue regions, the reduced ﬂow speed will lead to an upstream propagation of the ﬂame front, which also increases the displacement amplitude. Hence, ﬂames sheets imposing a density jump are prone to a hydrodynamic kind of instability. This mechanism will be assessed analytically in the following. Assuming inviscid Eulerian ﬂow equations up- and downstream of the ﬂame ∂u j ∂x j = 0 (1.015) ∂ui ∂t + u j ∂ui ∂x j = −1 ρ ∂p ∂xi, (1.016) inserting harmonic perturbations of the form exp(σt + i k x 1 ± kx 2) for all ﬂow states and coupling both domains by use of the jump conditions of Eq. (1.07), one retrieves a dispersion relation σ = Ω0 s L k (1.017) with the Darrieus-Landau parameter Ω0 = ∝∇adicallow e 3 + e 2 − e − e e + 1. (1.018) This is the classical result obtained by Landau and Darrieus and predicts that ﬂame sheets are unconditionally unstable to perturbations of all wave lengths, since Ω0 ≥ 0. In particular, the growth rate linearly increases with k and, thus, shorter wave lengths are more ampliﬁed than longer ones. Based on this result, one would expect that planar ﬂames always develop high frequency oscillations that rapidly grow in amplitude until non-linear effects lead to saturation. It was already mentioned in Sec. 1.01.02 that such a behavior could not be observed experimentally. Instead, planar ﬂames form a cellular structure of a certain wave- length, which suggests the existence of a maximum growth rate at this wave length (or close to it, since the amplitude of the observed cellular ﬂame structure is ﬁnite and, therefore, non-linear effects have already lead to a saturation). Markstein sug- gested a phenomenological correction by relating the ﬂame speed to the local ﬂame sheet curvature multiplied by a factorl M, see Eq. (1.08). This factor is called the Mark- stein length and is of the order of the thickness of the convective-diffusive layer of a ﬂame. It lumps the effects of various transport processes inside the ﬂame as well as those concerning the kinetics of the chemical reaction into one single parameter. Physically, ﬂame stretching effects result from interactions of the external hydrody- namic ﬁeld and the inner ﬂame structure, which leads to convective ﬂuxes along the ﬂame redistributing heat and species. This affects the local reaction rates and thus the 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation ﬂame speed. According to Zeldovich et al, introduction of a curvature de- pendent ﬂame speed is analogous to the introduction of a stabilizing surface tension at the ﬂame front. The solution of Darrieus and Landau is asymptotically valid for Péclet number Pe = L/δD approaching inﬁnity. Hence, the Darrieus-Landau model is a proper ap- proximation in the limit of very long wave lengths. Stated differently, expanding all state variables using the small parameter 1/ Pe, it is the zeroth order approximation of the ﬂow problem. The extension of Markstein is then a ﬁrst order correction of that model in the limiting case of high activation energies of the global reaction. It is interesting to note that this ﬁrst order correction only affects the ﬂame speed and not the jump conditions of Eq. (1.07). This can be explained by the strong dependency of the ﬂame speed to temperature for high activation energy global reactions. Later studies could derive expressions for the ﬂame speed from ﬁrst principles using matched asymptotic expansion methods. They included also effects of terms that are of ﬁrst or higher order in 1/ Pe and considered different Lewis and Zeldovich num- bers. Since these theories capture effects of diffusive and convective ﬂuxes along the ﬂame front and, hence, ﬂame stretch related effects, those studies do not strictly sep- arate thermal-diffusive and hydrodynamic mechanisms. Indeed, they capture the net effect of both mechanisms. Particularly, Frankel and Sivashinsky and Pelce and Clavin derived a dispersion relation accounting for hydrodynamic effects as well as for heat conduction and mass diffusion: σ = Ω0 s L k − Ω1 D t hk 2 (1.019) with Ω1 = ˆe (1 − ˆe )2 − ˆe ln( ˆe ) (2Ω0 + 1 + ˆe ) − ˆe (1 + Ω0 )( ˆe + Ω0 )Ze(1 − Le) ∫ E ln(1+ ˜x ) ˜x d ˜x 2(1 − ˆe ) [ ˆe + (1 + ˆe )Ω0 ], (1.020) where ˆe = ρb /ρu denotes the inverse of the expansion ratio. V iscosity, responsible for diffusion of momentum and quantiﬁed by the Prandtl number in the non-dimensional framework, was found to have only a secondary effect on ﬂame stability and, thus does not show up here. This is surprising, since it usually is of the same order of magnitude as thermal and mass diffusivity. And, indeed, the more recent study of Matalon showed that, if viscosity is allowed to vary across the ﬂame sheet, it has an effect on ﬂame stability which is equal to the one imposed by other diffusive processes. Its impact is proportional to the Prandtl number and always has a stabilizing effect. ForΩ1 > 0 the ﬂame is thermo-diffusively stable and vice versa for Ω1 < 0. Based on this criterion, one can derive a critical Lewis number for which Ω1 = 0 holds. For E = 0 this coincides with the critical Lewis number Le 0 c,TD derived in Sec. 1.02.02. It is interesting to note that the critical Lewis number Le c,TD computed from Eq. (1.020) de- creases for increasing E, see Fig. 1.010 (top). Hence, gas expansion effects extend the Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets 0. 8 0. 9 1. 1 Lec, TD/ Le 0 c,TD 0 2 4 6 80 0. 1 0. 2 0. 3 E [-] Ω 0 Figure 1.010: Darrieus-Landau parameter Ω0 and critical Lewis number for the on- set of thermal-diffusive instability Le c,TD plotted over non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume.

Fig. 1.010 (bottom) shows howΩ0 behaves for an increasingly strong density jump. A steep increase up to E ≈ 2 can be observed, which is followed by a saturation and even a slight decrease towards very high E. Hence, one must conclude that the Darrieus-Landau mechanism is most dominant for a non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume of E ≈ 3.02 and is even slightly reduced towards higher E. Fig. 1.011 a shows the growth rate over non-dimensional wave number as deﬁned by Eq. (1.019). Fig 1.011 b shows the same result but this time plotted over wave length. 1.02 Mechanisms Governing Flame Propagation The green lines visualize the impact of the strength of the density jump alone, since for each E exactly the corresponding critical Lewis number Le c,TD is chosen. A higher non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume hence leads to a steeper slope of the dispersion relation plotted overk ∗, which however saturates around E ≈ 3 and then slightly decreases. The slope directly follows the trend of Ω0 shown in Fig. 1.010 (bottom). The red lines visualize how Lewis number affects the dispersion relation for a ﬁxed non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume of E = 6. Lewis numbers larger than the critical one, lead to parabolic dispersion relations, which intersect the zero growth rate line at a critical wave number. Further, they exhibit a certain wave number of maximum growth. Decreasing the Lewis number below its critical value leads to a superposition of thermal-diffusive and hydrodynamic instability mechanisms and, therefore, to a dispersion relation of increasing slope fork ∗ → ∞. Summarizing, all ﬂame fronts are subject to a destabilizing hydrodynamic mecha- nism since combustion is associated with exothermic reactions, which always lead to an increase in speciﬁc volume. Depending on the Lewis number, thermal-diffusive mechanisms may either stabilize a ﬂame front (Le> Le 0 c,TD ) or further destabilize it (Le < Le 0 c,TD ). The stabilizing effect of this mechanism increases with expansion ratio. 1.02.04 Advection of Perturbations at Inclined Flames So far only freely propagating ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary were ana- lyzed. Such ﬂames are however of no relevance for thermoacoustically driven com- bustion instabilities, since they allow not for continuous operation. Therefor, the ﬂame sheet has to be anchored such that it stays at a ﬁxed position. One example of such a device is a Bunsen burner, where the ﬂame is anchored at the burner rim. In this chapter, any additional effects of the anchoring shall be excluded from the analysis and only the behavior of the ﬂame sheet far away from this point shall be of interest. It should be noted that the advection of perturbations along an inclined ﬂame sheet is ultimately only a consequence of the fact that ﬂames propagate normal to themselves and the imposed anchoring of the ﬂame. Nevertheless, it constitutes an important mechanisms, which is not obvious. Therefore, it is treated as a distinct mechanism here. Fig. 1.012 shows a sketch of such a ﬂame sheet. The fresh gases stream along the verticalx 1 axis by a mean ﬂow velocity u 1 until they eventually reach the ﬂame sheet that burns at a constant speed s 0 L. From geometrical considerations, the angle between ﬂame the sheet and the velocity u 1 is computed as α∗ = sin(α) = s 0 L /u 1, with the non-dimensional ﬂame angle α∗. At α∗ = 1 the ﬂame speed equals the ﬂow velocity and the ﬂame propagates normal to the fresh ﬂow. For 0 < α∗ < 1, the ﬂame sheet propagates slower than the ﬂow ﬁeld and hence it can only be stabilized at an angle α< 90◦. One important consequence of such an inclination is that perturbations of the ﬂame front are advected downstream by a velocity u∥ = u 1 cos(α), which is the to the Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets Figure 1.012: Sketch of an anchored and perturbed ﬂame sheet that is inclined by an angleα with respect to the ﬂow velocity of the fresh mixture. mean ﬂame sheet projected ﬂow velocity u 1. In terms of the non-dimensional ﬂame angle it writes u∥ = u 1 √ 1 − (α∗)2. In summary, the main property of inclined ﬂames is that perturbations of the ﬂame sheet are advected along the mean ﬂame front at a velocity u∥. How does this interfere with the three other mechanisms explicated in Secs. 1.02.01–1.02.03? Let us for now assume that all of the so far mentioned mechanisms are simply superimposed. Then, ﬂame front displacements of growing amplitude — either driven by a hydrodynamic or a thermal-diffusive mechanism — would be advected downstream along the mean ﬂame front by a velocity u∥. Consequently, the originally absolutely unstable ﬂame sheet is now convectively unstable and the growth of ﬂame wrinkles becomes a spatial — instead of a temporal — phenomenon. One might now wonder if the preceding assumption of a perturbation growth rate that is invariant to changes in the ﬂame angleα was too naive. In this regard, Petersen and Emmons experimentally showed that inclined ﬂames indeed exhibit a spatial growth of ﬂame front perturbations that could be associated with the Darrieus-Landau mechanism. They found that, depending on the equivalence ratio, stable or unstable ﬂame sheets could be established. The unstable cases are split into two groups: Those that develop growing ﬂame displacements at a natural frequency without any forcing and those that are stable, but show growing disturbances when the anchoring position is displaced harmonically at a certain frequency. Assuming that the observed natu- ral frequency approximately corresponds to the wave number where the dispersion relation predicts a maximum growth rate, it is possible to compute a correspond- ing Markstein length, see Fig. 1.011 a for a qualitative example of such a dispersion relation. A second method to estimate the Markstein length relies on data gathered from the setup with a forced ﬂame anchoring. By assuming that the lowest forc- ing frequency, where the ﬂame sheet does not respond, corresponds to the critical wave number (zero growth rate) of the dispersion relation, a Markstein length can be computed. Both methods yielded similar results, which cross-validates the individual 1.03 Low-Order Models methods. Therefore, the hydrodynamic and thermal-diffusive mechanism presented in Sec. 1.02.03 are also relevant for anchored ﬂames. This was further conﬁrmed by subse- quent studies. Of particular interest is the work of Searbyet al, who studied the dynamics of stable Bunsen-type ﬂames (no natural oscillations) whose ﬂame anchoring is harmonically displaced by a movable wire. As already reported by Petersen and Emmons, this leads to the occurrence of advected ﬂame front perturbations of growing amplitude. For such a situation, Searbyet al compared experimental results to predictions of a modiﬁed version of the so-called Michelson- Sivashinsky (MS) equation. This kind of equation exhibits a dispersion rela- tion as discussed in Sec. 1.02.03 and, additionally, includes non-linear terms accounting for the mechanisms discussed in Sec. 1.02.01. Searbyet al further extended this equation by adding ﬂame parallel advection as described in this section. This new equation now covers all of the four modes of ﬂame propagation introduced above. V ery good agreement between this model and the experimental data was found — even for the non-linear saturation process. That means, everything learned by study- ing downward propagating planar ﬂames should indeed be important to understand the dynamics of inclined ﬂames. 1.03 Low-Order Models So far an overview of the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of planar thin ﬂames has been provided. In order to model the propagation of arbitrary ﬂame sheets, several methods were developed — the MS equation, as one example, has already been mentioned. Another one is the so called level-set or G-equation approach. It is one of the most important and wide-spread methods applied in the ﬁeld of ﬂame front stability anal- ysis and thermoacoustics. Besides this, it has also found application in many other disciplines such as crystal growth, multi-phase ﬂows or reachable set com- putations. Other than the MS equation, the G-equation approach inherently ne- glects the hydrodynamic mechanism described in Sec. 1.02.03 and, therefore, does not take into account any ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. In its most basic form, it only fulﬁlls the kinematic relation explicated in Sec. 1.02.01 stating that ﬂame fronts propagate normal to themselves. Often it is supplement by introducing a curvature-dependent ﬂame speed, which then also respects the thermal-diffusive mechanisms for Le≳ Le 0 c,TD and no ﬂow strain, as outlined in Sec. 1.02.02. By coupling the G-equation approach additionally with an (incompressible) ﬂow solver using jump conditions or a compa- rable approach, also the hydrodynamic mechanisms can be captured [100–104]. The basic 2 D G-equation approach of an inclined ﬂame sheet can be mapped to a 1 D problem, which results — after linearization — in a simple advection-diffusion equa- tion. This equation serves as a basis for most of the available analytically solvable Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets low-order models of acoustically perturbed ﬂame fronts. Just like the G-equation, it only captures the basic kinematics of a ﬂame sheet, including advection and a curvature-dependent ﬂame speed. It is important to note that it speciﬁcally excludes any ﬂame-ﬂow feedback and, hence, the hydrodynamic mechanism of Sec. 1.02.03. In the following, ﬁrstly the level-set or G-equation approach is introduced in Sec. 1.03.01, before the aforementioned 1 D advection-diffusion equation is derived from it in Sec. 1.03.02. 1.03.01 Level-Set or G-Equation Approach Based on the early works of Darrieus and Landau, Markstein was the ﬁrst to introduce a partial differential equation (PDE) in space and time to model the dynamics of a scalar ﬁeld whose zero iso-line is identiﬁed with the gas dynamic discontinuity representing the ﬂame front. The PDE he provided represents the ﬂame as a front that propagates normal to itself at a velocitys L with respect to a given un- burned ﬂow ﬁeld just ahead of it. T o the best knowledge of the author, Williams was the ﬁrst to use the letter “G ” as representation for said scalar ﬁeld. Presumably since then, the governing PDE is also known as the G-equation. It should be pointed out that the G -ﬁeld itself has no physical meaning and is just a tool to track the ﬂame front. As already mentioned, the ﬂame front is represented by the iso-line/-surface G (xi, t ) = 0. Regions of G < 0 represent the unburned mixture and those of G > 0 burned products. The ﬂame normal direction, pointing towards the hot products, is computed from n f,i = ∂G ∂xi / √ ∂G ∂x j ∂G ∂x j (1.021) using the Einstein summation convention. The total derivative of the G-ﬁeld has to satisfy d G d t = ∂G ∂t + ∂G ∂xi d xi d t = 0. (1.022) in order to ensure that G stays zero everywhere at the ﬂame front. Following Sec. 1.02.01, ﬂames propagate normal to themselves and, hence, each point on the ﬂame sheet moves relatively to the cold ﬂow ﬁelduu,i ahead of it according to d xi d t = uu,i − n f,i s L. (1.023) Combining Eqs. (1.021)–(1.023) one obtains the ﬁnal version of the G-equation ∂G ∂t + uu,i ∂G ∂xi = s L √ ∂G ∂x j ∂G ∂x j. (1.024) 1.03 Low-Order Models The non-linearity in this equation results from the fact that the front propagates nor- mal to itself and that there exist only two distinct states, burned (G > 0) and unburned (G < 0), see Sec. 1.02.01 for more details. As discussed in Sec. 1.02.02, the ﬂame speed of thin ﬂames depends on the local cur- vature of the ﬂame sheetκf, which is computed from the G-ﬁeld by taking the diver- gence of the normalized gradient (i. e. the ﬂame normal vector) κf = − ∂ ∂xi ∂G ∂xi √ ∂G ∂x j ∂G ∂x j, (1.025) see e. g. Smereka. Using the curvature dependent deﬁnition of the ﬂame speed of Eq. (1.08) together with Eq. (1.025) and inserting both to the G-equation (1.024) one obtains ∂G ∂t + ui ∂G ∂xi = s 0 L ( 1 − l M κf ) √ ∂G ∂x j ∂G ∂x j. (1.026) Here, ﬂow strain was neglected and, thus, curvature is assumed to be the only source of ﬂame stretch. It becomes apparent that consideration of a curvature dependent ﬂame speed adds a diffusion term (Laplacian) with diffusion coefﬁcients 0 l l M to the governing equation of a ﬂame sheet. Hence, ﬂame curvature effectively reduces steep gradients of the G-ﬁeld and, for example, ensures the round tip of a Bunsen ﬂame by increasing the ﬂame speed at this strongly curved ﬂame region. Concerning the simulation of anchored ﬂames, problems arise at points where ﬂames are aerodynamically anchored and signiﬁcant heat losses are present, e. g. at Bunsen ﬂames. Those quenching effects change the inner structure of the ﬂame and, on a hydrodynamical scale, the ﬂame speed. This is especially important when a realistic ﬂow solver is coupled with a G-equation approach. Due to friction, ﬂow velocity decreases to zero right at the boundary. If the ﬂame speed is not adjusted in this region, i. e. by considering quenching and/or curvature effects, the ﬂame would ﬂash back in the boundary layer of the ﬂow and, hence, cannot be stabilized. While some studies implemented these quenching effects using empirical correlations, others artiﬁcially ﬁxed the G-ﬁeld at the burner mouth using a Dirichlet boundary condition [100–102, 109]. 1.03.02 1 D Linearized Flame Dynamics As already mentioned above, practical combustion systems often rely on aerodynam- ically stabilized ﬂames whose fronts are inclined by an angleα with respect to the bulk ﬂow velocity of the fresh mixture far away from the ﬂame. The dynamics of such ﬂames can be assessed best by mapping the G-equation to a 1 D coordinate system by Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets Figure 1.013: Sketch of a perturbed ﬂame front ( ) around its mean ( ). T wo coordinate systems are shown: the laboratory ( x L 1, x L 2 ) and the ﬂame aligned ( x F 1, x F 2 ) one. In the ﬁrst, the deﬂected ﬂame front is described by η+ η′, in the latter by ξ (taken from ). application of one of these transformations : Laboratory coordinates: G = x L 1 − η(x L 2, t ) (1.027) Flame coordinates: G = x F 2 − ξ(x F 1, t ). (1.028) A crucial assumption of this approach is that the 2 D ﬂame front is indeed a function ofx F 1 (or x L 2 ), i. e. there exists a unique value of ξ (or η) for each possible value of x F 1 (or x L 2 ). This requirement may be violated at high amplitudes. In this case, the two transformations of Eqs. (1.027) and (1.028) cannot be applied any more. T wo new coordinate systems are introduced here, on the one hand, the so called laboratory co- ordinate system, indicated by a superscript “L ” (x L 1/2 ), and, on the other, ﬂame aligned coordinates, indicated by a superscript “F” ( x F 1/2 ). The position of the ﬂame front is described by a quantity η in the former, and by ξ in the latter. Both are sketched for a perturbed ﬂame in Fig. 1.013. Fluctuations of the inlet velocity u 1 = u 1 + u′ 1 lead – as indicated in Fig. 1.013 – to displacements η′ and ξ in laboratory and ﬂame coordi- nates, respectively. Throughout the thesis, mean quantities are denoted by an overbar (.), while a primed quantity (.)′ indicates a ﬂuctuation around this mean with an am- plitude of order O (ǫ) with ǫ ≪ 1. Inserting Eq. (1.028) into Eq. (1.026) results in a 1 D description of the dynamics of an inclined ﬂame sheet in ﬂame coordinates ∂ξ ∂t + u∥ ∂ξ ∂x F = u⊥ − s 0 L ( 1 − l M κf )    √ 1 + ( dξ dx F )2 (1.029) with a ﬂame geometry dependent curvature term κf. Assuming a 2 D slit geometry of rectangular cross sectional area of the ﬂame (index “slit”), the mean curvature term 1.03 Low-Order Models writes κf,slit = ∂2 ξ ∂x F √ 1 + ( dξ dx F )2 − ( ∂ξ ∂x F )2 ∂2 ξ ∂x F ( 1 + ( dξ dx F )2 )3/2, (1.030). It should be noted that the second term of this equation only adds a O ( ǫ3 ) contribution to Eq. (1.029) and may hence be dropped for small ﬂame front displace- ments. Similarly, for such conditions, the square root term in the denominator would asymptote to 1 + O (ǫ) and may be approximated as unity. For conical ﬂames of cir- cular cross sectional ﬂame area, additionally, an azimuthal curvature contribution depending on the local ﬂame radiusr f has to be considered. Neglecting the second as well as the square root term of Eq. (1.030), it writes κf,con = 1 ( r f + ∂2 ξ ∂x F ), (1.031) where the index “con” denotes a conical ﬂame. In the following the differences between Slit and Conical ﬂames are neglected and only the curvature relation for Slit ﬂames is considered. Assuming ﬂuctuations of the state variablesu 1 and ξ of order O (ǫ) and neglecting all second order terms in ǫ, a linear PDE ∂ξ ∂t + u∥ ∂ξ ∂x F = u′ ⊥ + l M s 0 L ∂2 ξ ∂x F 2 (1.032) is retrieved. A relation s L = u⊥ was applied, taking into account the fact that, in steady state, the ﬂame normal ﬂow velocity is exactly balanced by the laminar ﬂame speed. Due to its simplicity, this advection-diffusion equation is well suited for analytical treatment. Neglecting ﬂame curvature effects (l M ≡ 0), the resulting non-homogeneous advection equation is solved by integration of the ﬂame-normal velocity perturbations ξ(x F 1, t ) = 1 u∥ ∫ x F u′ ⊥ ( ˜x F 1, t − x F 1 − ˜x F u∥ ) d ˜x F 1 + ξ ( 0, t − x F u∥ ). (1.033) The second term on the right-hand side of this equation considers perturbations at the ﬂame anchoring (x F 1 = 0). Hence, perturbations of the ﬂame base would reach the ﬂame tip at a time τr = L f / u∥, where L f denotes the steady state ﬂame length, see Fig. 1.013. This quantity is known as the characteristic time of restoration. Expressing Eq. (1.032) in laboratory coordinates by use of Eq. (1.027) again assuming l M ≡ 0, one obtains ∂η′ ∂t − cos(α) sin(α) u 1 ∂η′ ∂x L = 1 sin(α) [ sin(α) u′ 1 + cos(α) u′ ] − s ′ L sin(α). (1.034) Inserting the relations η′ = ξ/ sin(α) and d x L 2 = −sin(α)d x F 1 (W edge ﬂames: “ +”) into this equation, transforms the equation in ﬂame aligned coordinates, as shown in Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets Eq. (1.032). Since, for small perturbations, both descriptions are equivalent, it is fa- vorable to use ﬂame aligned coordinates for modeling the ﬂame front dynamics since here the equation becomes more compact. As will be shown in Sec. 6.02, however, the use of a coordinate system other than the ﬂame aligned one can be advantageous for evaluating ﬂame surface integrals, due to a simpler treatment at the boundaries. Eq. (1.032) holds for slit and conical conﬁgurations. It has, however, to be noted that, just like in the aforementioned G-equation approach, ﬂow strain as well as ﬂame- ﬂow-ﬂame feedback resulting from exothermic effects were neglected. Both would act quantitatively different for the two ﬂame geometries. Another consequence of ﬂame geometry concerns ﬂame curvature: Due to their azimuthal curvature, coni- cal ﬂames are generally exposed to higher ﬂame stretch than slit ﬂames, compare Eq. (1.030) for Slit and Eq. (1.031) for conical ﬂames. The maximum stretch due to azimuthal curvature is imposed at the ﬂame tip for Bunsen ﬂames and at the ﬂame anchoring for W edge ﬂames, since there the respective local ﬂame radiusr f reaches a minimum. It follows that advected ﬂame front perturbations are exposed to increas- ingly stronger stretch rates for Bunsen ﬂames, which should lead to smoother ﬂame shapes towards the tip compared to Slit ﬂames. This mollifying effect impacts also the generation of ﬂame pockets at the ﬂame tip (pinch off). For W edge conﬁgu- rations it is the other way round: ﬂame stretch decreases while a ﬂame perturbation is advected along the ﬂame front, which make it more prone to the formation of cusps. 1.04 Summary In this chapter, the available literature on the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary was reviewed. The general idea concerning the analysis of such ﬂames is based on the fact that these ﬂames can be viewed as propagating discon- tinuities separating two coupled ﬂow domains of different densities, namely the do- main of the fresh mixture and the domain of the burned products. Based on matched asymptotic expansion techniques, a propagation speed of the discontinuity (ﬂame speed) and jump conditions connecting the two ﬂow domains could be derived from ﬁrst principles. This speciﬁc way of describing thin ﬂame sheets shifts the focus away from details of the combustion process to macroscopic properties such as ﬂame speed, ﬂame shape and acceleration/deceleration of the underlying ﬂow ﬁeld. Four mechanisms governing the dynamics of thin ﬂame sheets could be identiﬁed: (i) the propagation of a ﬂame sheet normal to itself, (ii) thermal-diffusive mechanisms interacting with the propagation speed of a ﬂame front, (iii) hydrodynamic features mainly affecting the surrounding ﬂow ﬁeld and (iv) the downstream advection of ﬂame perturbations along the ﬂame sheet for inclined ﬂames (neglecting the dynam- ics close to the anchoring point). Finally, the wide-spread G-equation approach was introduced in its 2 D non-linear as well as in its 1 D linearized form. It was pointed out that it only captures the kinematics of a ﬂame front, but inherently neglects ﬂame- 1.04 Summary ﬂow feedback, i. e. hydrodynamic mechanisms. This is a substantial shortcoming of this method, as will be shown in the course of this thesis. Dynamics of Thin Flame Sheets 2 Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames A literature review on interactions between acoustics and burner- stabilized premixed ﬂames is provided, which builds upon the con- cepts outlined in the previous section. Additionally, the notion of convected velocity perturbations is introduced, around which most theoretical predictions of the acoustic ﬂame response evolve. Chapter. 1 discussed the dynamics of ﬂame sheets far away from any boundary. Four different governing mechanisms were identiﬁed, which allowed to break down the overall ﬂame dynamics into their canonical components. This realization lays the foundations for the analyses of acoustically perturbed burner-stabilized ﬂames, which will be conducted in this chapter. Such conﬁgurations introduce essentially two new features, that is (i) a burner where the ﬂame is anchored/stabilized and enclosed and (ii) acoustic perturbations interacting with the ﬂame. Furthermore, not only the ﬂame shape but also the change of the global heat release rate will now be an output quan- tity of interest. Due to these features and requirements, the low-order modeling con- cepts introduced in the previous chapter need to be extended in order to cope with thermoacoustically relevant setups. Burner-stabilized ﬂames consist of multiple ﬂame sheets of ﬁnite extension that are usually anchored by a separation-induced low-speed region close to a wall. Addi- tionally, they might be conﬁned by a casing and exposed to nonconstant upstream ﬂow proﬁles. It becomes clear that the rather idealized ﬂame dynamics described in Chap. 1 might be enriched by additional phenomena such as ﬂame-wall or ﬂame- ﬂame interactions. Furthermore, the mean state of a ﬂame is no longer trivial and might signiﬁcantly impact the dynamics of the overall system. Finally, the exis- tence of acoustic perturbations introduces further complications. The individual ﬂame sheets of the overall ﬂame are now externally forced, which introduces completely new dynamic features. Therefore, the acoustic ﬁeld inside the respective burner con- ﬁguration needs to be studied and acoustic-ﬂame sheet interactions have to be con- sidered. Knowing how a ﬂame reacts to acoustic ﬂuctuations is only half the story when deal- ing with thermoacoustic interactions. The other half concerns the generation of acous- tic perturbations by the ﬂame itself. It can be shown that acoustically compact ﬂames act as a monopole-like source of sound whose strength is proportional to ﬂuctua- Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames (a) Bunsen (conical Λ) (b) Slit (c) W edge (conical V) Figure 2.01: Investigated ﬂame geometries (taken from ). tions of their global heat release rate. Consequently, the dynamics of the overall heat release rate is an important feature that has to be discussed in this section, as well. This chapter is structured as follows: Sec. 2.01 provides a deﬁnition of the class of problems that are tackled by this thesis, i. e. the analyzed burner conﬁgurations and fuel-oxidizer mixtures are deﬁned. Secs. 2.02 and 2.03 then provide a literature review on the dynamics and low-order modeling concepts of acoustically perturbed ﬂames, respectively. 2.01 Problem Deﬁnition In this thesis laminar lean methane-air ﬂames of different equivalence ratios are ana- lyzed that are operated far away from the region of lean extinction. They all exhibit Lewis numbers close to unity and are hence thermal-diffusively stable. Furthermore, they can in good approximation be assumed to be thin for all analyzed setups, as pointed out in Sec. 1.01.01. The initial temperature of the fresh mixture is always kept constant (300 K). The geometrical details of all investigated burners shall resemble a backward fac- ing step conﬁguration, which allows for an efﬁcient anchoring of the ﬂame in the low-speed region induced by the separating ﬂow ﬁeld. Depending on the speciﬁc ge- ometrical details of the burner, the boundary and initial conditions, ﬂames of several different geometrical shapes can be stabilized. Three of the most important ones are shown in Fig. 2.01: The Bunsen, the Slit and the W edge ﬂame. The three illustrations immediately point out that ﬂame sheets of realistic burner setups are not necessarily planar and may also intersect. Furthermore, interactions with combustor walls, e. g. at the anchoring position, imposes new dynamics via quenching, viscous effects and ﬂow separation. Due to advection, any ﬂame front perturbation will eventually reach the ﬂame tip, where it might lead to a pinch-off of burning bubbles of fresh mixture. All of these effects complicate the analysis by adding new dynamic features. Their respective signiﬁcance for the process of interest, however, might not necessarily be high. Figuring out what is important and what not is one major goal of this work. In order to reduce complexity, this work mainly focuses on Slit conﬁgurations. The combustion region of all of the considered ﬂame conﬁgurations shall be limited by lateral constraints. This respects the fact that in technical applications ﬂames are 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions Figure 2.02: Unconﬁned (left) vs. conﬁned (right) ﬂame. usually conﬁned in order to use the sensible enthalpy of the hot products or to shield the combustion process from the environment. Fig. 2.02 compares the jet of hot gases of an open ﬂame to the one of a conﬁned ﬂame. It becomes clear that a sufﬁciently narrow conﬁnement might alter the mean ﬂow ﬁeld by accelerating the burned gases and, in doing so, also the acoustic ﬂame response. Finally, all conﬁgurations are exposed to acoustic perturbations whose minimum wave length shall be much longer than the height of the respective ﬂame. This limita- tion demands that all ﬂames areacoustically compact, i. e. they are exposed to acous- tic pressure or velocity perturbations that are in-phase everywhere along the ﬂame sheets. Furthermore, under such conditions perturbed ﬂames can be approximated as monopole-like sources of sound. 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions The analysis of the dynamics of acoustically perturbed ﬂame conﬁgurations, as de- scribed in Sec. 2.01, requires some extensions of the theory of freely propagating ﬂame sheets presented in Chap. 1. A literature review on what has been achieved so far is provided in the proceeding section. Sec. 2.02.01 provides fundamental insights into how ﬂame sheets, as introduced in Chap. 1, respond to acoustic perturbations. These fundamental studies are followed by a review of the literature concerning acoustically perturbed Bunsen ﬂames in Sec. 2.02.02. Here, the focus is put on the shape and the dynamics of acoustically trig- gered ﬂame front displacements. Section 2.02.03 then provides an overview on how these displacements are connected to variations of the global heat release rate. Crucial thermoacoustic concepts, such as the ﬂame transfer function and its representations in the frequency and time domain are introduced. 2.02.01 Freely Propagating Flame Sheet In a ﬁrst step, the interaction of acoustic perturbations with an freely propagating planar ﬂame sheet is analyzed, which should provide guidance on how to deal with the more complex problem of a burner stabilized ﬂame. For all cases studied here, the ﬂame thickness is much smaller than the wave length of any relevant acoustic Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames perturbation ( ≤ O ( 103 ) Hz). Therefore, we can rely on the ﬂame sheet assumptions introduced in Chap. 1 when assessing acoustics-ﬂame interactions. According to theoretical studies, for the frequency range that is relevant when considering com- bustion instabilities, the ﬂame speed is supposed to depend on the acoustic forcing, i. e.s L is thought to be a function of the acoustic ﬁeld. This fact, however, requires further rigorous experimental validation and is, for the sake of simplic- ity, usually neglected in thermoacoustic studies. The validity of this simpliﬁcation for many setups of practical relevance is supported by experimental and numerical stud- ies, such as the one of Baillotet al or Michaels and Ghoniem, which leads to the conclusion that the impact of acoustics on the ﬂame speed is indeed rather weak. It is also commonly assumed that premixed ﬂames predominantly respond to ve- locity perturbations and almost completely ignore changes in pressure. Thus, the ﬂame speed is basically not affected by acoustics. Based on these realizations, it can be concluded that acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations essentially displace a ﬂame front and, in doing so, alter its shape. This may trigger dynamical processes governed by the four mechanisms identiﬁed in Chap. 1. A fundamental study analysing details of acoustic-ﬂame interactions has been per- formed by Lieuwen for the case of a planar downward propagating ﬂame of inﬁnite extension that is hit by a planar acoustic wave at an angle of incidenceθ: De- pending on the angle θ, acoustic waves are transmitted and reﬂected at different ratios at the ﬂame front. As known from optics, when a disturbance travels from a medium of lower to one of higher propagation speed, there exists a “cut-off” angle depending on the density ratio across the ﬂame, where the incident wave is fully reﬂected at the ﬂame front. This only happens for upstream and never for downstream acoustic ex- citation. Furthermore, baroclinic production of vorticity at the ﬂame front acts as an acoustic damping mechanism. These results indicate that ﬂame front displacements caused by acoustic perturbations affect the surrounding ﬂow ﬁeld, for example, by introducing vortical structures. And, indeed, such features are also observed in the vicinity of burner-stabilized ﬂames, as will be shown in the course of this thesis. 2.02.02 Burner-Stabilized Flame Acoustics-ﬂame interactions are signiﬁcantly more complex for burner stabilized ﬂames than for freely propagating ﬂame sheets. Although acoustic velocity ﬂuctu- ations mainly displace a ﬂame, see the previous section, their spatial shape, ﬂame- wall and ﬂame-ﬂame interactions add some important burner-conﬁguration depen- dent peculiarities. In the following a brief overview of the most important ﬁndings is provided. In the ﬁrst part, the various modes of interactions of acoustic perturbations with ﬂames are covered. Knowing how ﬂame displacements are generated, the review focuses in a second part on the response of a ﬂame to these perturbations. Interest- ingly, the literature revolves around the notion of convected velocity perturbations 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions instead of the four canonical mechanisms introduced in Sec. 1.02, which motivates the analysis conducted in this thesis. Acoustic Interactions with Burner-Stabilized Flames Based on the fact that ﬂames are usually stabilized in the vicinity of sharp edges where acoustics triggers the shedding of vortices [123–126], it is natural to struc- ture a review on acoustic interactions with burner-stabilized ﬂames according to a decomposition of acoustic perturbations into a potential (irrotational) and a vortical (solenoidal) contribution. This decomposition accounts for the respective nature of the individual ﬂow modes and allows for their separate analysis. Investigations of the vortical part of the acoustic perturbation ﬁeld, on the one hand, have not drawn too much attention in the literature. One reason for this might be that perturbed ﬂame sheets generate a reasonable amount of vorticity by themselves [128– 130], which makes it hard to isolate effects of acoustically triggered vortex shedding. Schlimpertet al tried to overcome this problem by neglecting ﬂame-induced gas expansion in their numerical model, which suppresses the generation of distract- ing ﬂame generated vorticity. In doing so, however, they at the same time removed dilatation effects, which signiﬁcantly dampen the vortical ﬂow component and bend the mean ﬂow shear layer away from the ﬂame. Hence, interactions of separating vor- tices with the ﬂame were overestimated compared to realistic conditions. According to their analysis, at proper levels of gas expansion and far away from the region of lean extinction, only interactions between the ﬂame base region and shed vorticity remain. On the other hand, the potential acoustic velocity ﬁeld in a backward-facing step combustor, as depicted in Fig. 2.02 (right), was closer analyzed in a series of numerical investigations by Lieuwen as well as Lee and Lieuwen. They found that the acoustic velocity ﬁeld interacting with the ﬂame front is essentially 2-dimensional with a maximum close to the ﬂame anchoring position, even for acoustically compact ﬂames. Since evaluation of the ﬂame response using such a model did — unexpect- edly — not yield signiﬁcant improvements compared to a 1-dimensional description of the velocity ﬁeld, this study has not drawn too much attention. Their principal ﬁnding was later experimentally conﬁrmed by Kornilovet al who did, how- ever, not explicitly mention the connection to the previous study of Lee and Lieuwen. Kornilovet al forced a Bunsen ﬂame, one time by moving the anchoring transversally in and out and, one time by imposing acoustic velocity perturbations. Both kinds of excitation resulted in very similar velocity ﬁelds, which are visualized in Fig. 2.03. The authors further evaluated the transfer functions from the forcing to the globally integrated heat release rate for both sets of experiments and found that they also agreed reasonably well. Hence, they indirectly conﬁrmed the ﬁndings of Lee and Lieuwen that acoustics interacts predominantly with the ﬂame base region. Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames Figure 2.03: Ti O 2 smoke trace ﬂow ﬁeld visualization of two Bunsen ﬂame forced at 200 Hz, one time by transversal movements of the ﬂame holder at which the ﬂame is anchored (left) and one time by acoustic excitation (right) (images are taken from Kornilovet al, Figs. 5 and 6). In summary, (i) the impact of acoustically triggered vorticity on a ﬂame is still unclear and (ii) the potential part of the acoustic velocity ﬁeld predominantly interacts with the ﬂame base region. It has to be emphasized that, although this review follows said ﬂow decomposition approach, many of the studies mentioned remained side notes in the body of literature on acoustics-ﬂame interactions or they did not explicitly follow such a decomposition-based mindset. Due to the fact, however, that this work is going to revisit such a mindset, the concept of ﬂow decomposition was granted a prominent position in this review. Flame Response to Acoustically Generated Displacements As explicated in Sec. 1.02.04, one essential dynamical feature of burner-stabilized in- clined ﬂames is the advection of ﬂame front perturbations. In this regard, Cuquel published an instructive experimental investigation of acoustically forced ﬂames. Fig. 2.04 shows four snapshots that were taken at equidistant phases at a fre- quency of 80 Hz. In accordance with the studies reviewed above, acoustic interactions displace the ﬂame close to the burner mouth. This creates ﬂame wrinkles, which are convected along the ﬂame front until they reach the ﬂame tip. In Fig. 2.04, two of these wrinkles are marked by a red and a green line, respectively. In each successive snapshot, they move by an approximately constant distance and are hence advected downstream by a ﬁxed velocity. At this point it should be emphasized that the ﬂame is anchored at the burner, i. e. any sudden displacement of the anchoring exerted by acoustic perturbations will eventu- ally be counteracted such that after some time the ﬂame has returned to its original steady state position. The information of the restored ﬂame anchoring will — just like any ﬂame front displacement — be advected along the front and will reach the ﬂame tip after a timeτr. Accordingly, Blumenthal et al named this period of time the characteristic time of restoration. It should, however, be noted that this time scales is characteristic for the advection of any ﬂame front feature, not just the restoration. In that sense it should rather be called the characteristic time of advection. 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions Figure 2.04: Snapshots of an acoustically excited Bunsen ﬂame at 80 Hz, taken at four equidistant phases. Clearly, two distinct wrinkles can be observed that are advected from the ﬂame base towards the tip at a constant speed, marked by a red and green line (images taken from Cuquel, Fig. 6.010, left; the red and green lines/arrows were added by the author). Having a closer look at the snapshots of Fig. 2.04, one notices that the wrinkles grow in amplitude while they are advected downstream. Furthermore, they develop a cusp like structure exhibiting a sharp edge at concave and very smooth contours at convex displacements. This is a consequence of the four governing mechanisms introduced in Sec. 1.02 and corresponds to the non-linear process illustrated in Fig. 1.05. Since the formation of cusps is a non-linear mechanism, it is not analyzed in detail any further here. It should be noted, though, that whenever such cusp-like structures are visible, non-linear mechanisms are at play and, consequently, the dynamics of the respective ﬂame is not purely linear anymore. In this regard, cusps are a good indicator that the linear regime has been left. The transition from the linear to the non-linear regime of acoustically forced Bunsen ﬂames has, for example, been analyzed more closely by Karimiet al. Concerning the dynamics of perturbed burner-stabilized ﬂames, there are essentially two types of studies: those which impose an acoustic forcing and those which me- chanically displace the anchoring, see the right and left hand side of Fig. 2.03, respectively. The ﬁndings of Lieuwen and Kornilovet al, stating that acoustics displaces mainly the ﬂame base regions, provides a clear connection be- tween both setups. Consequently, it seems natural that also the observed respective dynamics are very similar and knowledge gathered from one conﬁguration could be transferred to the other. This potential, however, has not been fully exploit so far. The dynamics of mechani- cally forced ﬂame sheets has been attributed to the net effect of the destabilizing hy- drodynamic mechanism described in Sec. 1.02.03 and the stabilizing thermal-diffusive mechanism described in Sec. 1.02.02 superimpose by advection. Interestingly, this idea has hardly been explicitly formulated in the literature on acoustically forced Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames Figure 2.05: Snapshots of a G-equation-based simulation of an acoustically excited Bunsen ﬂame at 120 Hz relying on the convective incompressible veloc- ity model introduced by Baillot et al, taken at three equidistant phases.

Instead, here the analysis has taken a very different way, centered around purely kinematic observations of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Baillotet al experimentally detected axially convected velocity perturbations just upstream of an acoustically per- turbed ﬂame inside the volume enclosed by the ﬂame sheets and the burner mouth. They explained these observations by both hydrodynamic interactions of the wrin- kled ﬂame front with the upstream ﬂow ﬁeld and the effect of gas expansion across the ﬂame. In principle, this hypothesis was later conﬁrmed by studies of Birbaud et al and Blanchard et al. The important point, however, of the study of Baillot et al is that it could retrieve a good match between experimentally measured perturbed ﬂame sheets and those obtained from a G-equation-based model only if axially convected velocity per- turbations upstream of the ﬂame were introduced, resembling the ones that have been measured. Fig. 2.05 depicts three successive snapshots of such a G-equation-based simulation, which illustrates the model of axially convected velocity perturbations and the resulting ﬂame shapes. Such a convective velocity model results in a linearly decreasing phase of the associated FTF (see next section), which was conﬁrmed by subsequent studies. Hence, Candel wrote in his 2013 review paper“This behavior [the linearly decreasing phase] is the signature of perturbations convected by the ﬂow of- ten revealing the presence of large structures conveyed by the ﬂow and impinging the ﬂame”(Candel et al, p. 98). In this speciﬁc case he was referring to a burner- stabilized W edge ﬂame that is clearly subjected to vortical structures shed from the burner rim. The notion of this statement, however, was generalized for all types of 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions ﬂames and it became state-of-the-art that acoustically excited premixed (Bunsen) ﬂames are subject to convected velocity perturbations. The contradictory point here is that Birbaudet al and Blanchard et al as well as even Baillot et al found that these perturbations are a consequence rather than a source of ﬂame front wrinkles. Therefore, the assumption of convected velocity perturbations seems to violate causality (they cannot be source and consequence at the same time). This point has not explicitly been adressed so far and will be clariﬁed in the course of this work. In summary, the most important mechanisms governing the linear response of in- clined ﬂame fronts to acoustic perturbations have been discussed: 1. Acoustics displaces predominantly the ﬂame base region 2. Flame displacements are advected downstream by a constant speed resulting in a characteristic time of restoration τr 3. Flame intrinsic instability mechanisms act on ﬂame displacements, which might lead to their growth in amplitude 4. Acoustically perturbed ﬂames exhibit axially convected velocity perturbations upstream of the ﬂame sheets What is missing in this overview are features concerning the ﬂame tip (pinch-off) and the anchoring (quenching, vortex shedding). They are, however, either essen- tially non-linear in nature, of secondary importance or beyond the scope of this work. Furthermore, there is a strong dependency of the ﬂame response on the respective burner conﬁguration. One important point here concerns the conﬁnement of the com- bustion region [141–144], another the boundary conditions of walls adjacent to the ﬂame sheet [121, 145–149]. Also the burner size is important as well as its geometry [151–153]. 2.02.03 Global Heat Release Rate Dynamics This thesis is devoted to the study of ﬂames in the context of thermoacoustic systems, where the ﬂame constitutes one speciﬁc sub-system. Therefore, the input/output re- lation of interest of the ﬂame module needs to quantify the sound that is produced by an acoustically perturbed ﬂame. In the regime of acoustically compactness, temporal ﬂuctuations of the global heat release act like an acoustic monopole whose dynamics is directly proportional to the normalized ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate of the ﬂame. In the linear regime, the mentioned input/output relation is established by the ﬂame transfer function (FTF) ˙Q ′ ˙Q = F (ω) u′ ref uref. (2.01) Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames It relates velocity ﬂuctuations at a reference position u′ ref to variations of the global heat release rate. For perfectly premixed ﬂames, a relation ˙Q ′ ˙Q = A′ f A f + ∫ s ′ L d A f ∫ s L d A f (2.02) holds, which connects ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate ˙Q ′ to ﬂuctuations of the ﬂame surface area A′ f and the mean surface integrated ﬂame speed s ′ L. For perfectly premixed ﬂames, as discussed here, the latter term is usually neglected and essentially becomes important at higher frequencies. The thermoacoustic response of premixed ﬂames is the consequence of a great va- riety of physical mechanisms including everything that has so far been mentioned in this and the previous chapter: hydrodynamic mechanisms leading to the growth of ﬂame front perturbations, thermal-diffusive processes stabilizing the front, non-linear mechanisms leading to the formation of cusps, quenching effects at walls and ﬂame- ﬂame interactions at the ﬂame tip. This section now deals with the ﬁnal step, which — following Eq. (2.02) — essentially comprises the computation of the ﬂame sur- face area for a given displaced ﬂame front. While this may sound trivial, it has some non-straightforward consequences, especially concerning ﬂame geometry. This will be examined in greater detail in Chap. 6. For the remainder of this section, some technical details concerning the representation of the linear ﬂame response will be discussed. A frequency domain representation of the linear response of a laminar Bunsen type ﬂame is depicted in Fig. 2.06. The left half of that ﬁgure (a+b) depicts the frequency response in terms of gain and phase, while the right half (c+d) shows the rather un- typical representations in terms of a polar plot and a plot of the real and the imaginary part of the FTF over frequency. Note that the gain has a logarithmic scale in Fig. 2.06 (a) and (c). These — sometimes also double logarithmic scales — are adopted from the ﬁeld of control theory, where this particular choice of scaling allows a simple identiﬁcation of the corner frequencies, i. e. frequencies above which a signal is at- tenuated instead of being passed through by the system (in the case of a low pass ﬁlter). These frequencies are also known as cut-off frequencies. Another illustration of the linear ﬂame response is the impulse response (IR), which is shown in Fig. 2.07 (left half). It can be considered as the time domain equivalent to the frequency response (FR) (Fig. 2.07; right half) and relates the heat release rate to ﬂuctuations of a reference velocity via temporal convolution (denoted by the ”∗“- operator): ˙Q ′ ˙Q = h(t ) ∗ u′ ref uref. (2.03) The axes of Fig. 2.07 have a linear scaling improving the presentation of the low fre- quency behavior compared to the previously shown logarithmic scale, which usually has a gain and a Strouhal number of order O (1). The behavior of the gain for values 2.02 Acoustics-Flame Interactions Figure 2.06: Representation of a typical linear ﬂame response of a Bunsen ﬂame in the frequency domain (frequency response) in terms of (a) gain, (b) phase, (c) polar plot with phase determining the angle and gain the radius and (d) real and imaginary part plotted over frequency (taken from Kornilov, Fig. 3.01). lower than O (1) is of little practical interest. Similarly, from a thermoacoustical point of view, predominantly the ﬂame dynamics at Strouhal numbers of order O (1) is im- portant. Therefore, in this thesis all frequency response plots exhibit linearly scaled axes. Characteristic features of the FTF of perfectly premixed laminar ﬂames are (i) a low frequency limit (f → 0) of unity, (ii) an essentially linear decay of phase and (iii) a low-pass behavior featuring reoccurring minima followed by local maxima. The IR of such ﬂames shows a more or less constant positive response that is fol- lowed by some strongly damped oscillations. It should however be noted that this characteristic strongly depends on the considered ﬂame geometry, as will be shown in Chap. 6. Keeping the geometry ﬁxed, the responses of several ﬂames are rather similar. Introducing a non-dimensional frequency, a so-called Strouhal number, us- ing the characteristic time of restorationf ∗ = f τr, Ducruix et al found that plotting the responses of the global heat release rate of harmonically forced Bunsen ﬂames of different inclination angles over such a Strouhal number causes the individ- ual curves to collapse on each other.

Therefore, a less rigorous analysis of the respective dynamics has been conducted for such con- ﬁgurations — mostly due to complexities introduced by the ﬂame anchoring and tip as well as by the acoustic forcing. Probably due to these difﬁculties, mostly phe- nomenological models were developed that enabled decent low-order predictions of the global heat release dynamics of acoustically perturbed ﬂames, however, obscured the analysis of the underlying physical processes, since they are not rigorously de- rived from ﬁrst principles. Early studies on the global ﬂame response to acoustic perturbations boiled the com- plete ﬂame dynamics down to a time lagτ and an interaction index n. This rather simplistic model became to be known in the literature as the n-τ model. It correctly captures the experimentally observed linear decrease of the FTF phase, however, predicts a frequency independent gain of valuen. This is a severe over- simpliﬁcation of the observed low-pass ﬁltering behavior of ﬂames, which was later taken into account by a semi-empirical model developed by Merk. He described the ﬂame front by use of a ﬁrst order low-pass ﬁlter that provided an improved gain prediction at the cost of a poorer phase behavior, which now saturates at−π/2. Sugi- 2.03 Low-Order Models moto and Matsui developed a model based on growing convected perturbations, which suffers from the same problem. Later studies focused on capturing the actual ﬂame front kinematics by use of a G- equation based approach that inherently neglects ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, see Sec. 1.03. One of the ﬁrst to capture the dynamics of inclined ﬂames using such a (1 D lin- earized) approach were Boyer and Quinard. They imposed an uniform in-phase velocity forcing u′ 1 = ˆA exp (i ωt ), u′ 2 = 0 (2.04) of amplitude ˆA and angular forcing frequency ω, which harmonically displaces the whole ﬂame sheet and found advected ﬂame displacements that propagate inside sta- tionary envelops. A laboratory coordinate system, as illustrated in Fig. 1.013, is used in this representation. This model will be referred to as the uniform velocity model in the following. By adding an additional growth termσξ to the 1 D G-equation, they artiﬁcially included otherwise neglected consequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. The growth rateσ that matched their experiments best, however, was signiﬁcantly smaller than the one computed from dispersion relations of planar freely propagating ﬂames. They attributed this discrepancy to a conﬁnement related stretching of the ﬂame in combination with a strong sensitivity of the underlying dispersion relation to stretch effects. Baillotet al assessed the dynamics of acoustically excited Bunsen ﬂames experimentally and analytically. They also relied on the 1 D linearized G-equation framework used by Boyer and Quinard, however, they dismissed the growth term. As already pointed out in Sec. 2.02.02, they measured velocity ﬂuctuations of the fresh mixture inside the region just downstream of the edge where the ﬂame is anchored, one time without ﬂame (“cold case”) and one time with ﬂame (“hot case”). They observed axially propagating velocity perturbations inside this zone with a speed close to the mean ﬂow velocity for both cases, which they attributed to vortex shedding for the cold and to the upstream inﬂuence of the perturbed ﬂame front for the hot case. Motivated by this observation, they imposed axially convected velocity perturbations u′ 1 = ˆA exp ( i k x L ), u′ 2 = −i k x L ˆA exp ( i k x L ) (2.05) fulﬁlling continuity for an axisymmetric frame of reference to their 1 D linearized G-equation framework. Here,k = ω/ u 1 denotes the wave vector of the forcing. V ery good agreement between experimentally measured and the modeled transient ﬂame shapes was found. This velocity model is – in accordance with the literature – called the “incompressible convective” model. Results of a G-equation based simu- lation relying on such a velocity model (withu′ 2 ≡ 0) are shown in Fig. 2.05. The ﬁrst to derive an analytical expression for the FTF using the G-equation frame- work were Fleiﬁlet al. Based on the observation that acoustic wave lengths Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames in the frequency range of interest are long compared to the ﬂame height, they as- sumed an uniform in-phase forcing of the ﬂame sheet by the velocity ﬁeld, as already applied by Boyer and Quinard. Neglecting variations in ﬂame speed along the ﬂame sheet, they exploit the fact that for perfectly premixed ﬂames the heat release rate is proportional to the instantaneous ﬂame surface area, see Eq. (2.02). Based on this assumption, they could derive an equation for the linearized heat release rate ﬂuctuations by evaluation of the instantaneous ﬂame surface area from a displaced ﬂame front. The resulting FTF showed the desired low-pass behavior, however, the phase saturated at−π/2 — just as in the model by Merk. Particularly for low frequencies it provided some useful predictions, though. Ducruix et al then generalized the model of Fleiﬁl et al for arbitrary ﬂame angles by introduction of a reduced frequency or Strouhal number ω∗. Schuller et al revisited the convective velocity model proposed by Baillot et al, extended it by imposing an axial decay of the convected waves and combined it with the approach of Fleiﬁlet al. This led to an improved description of the FTF phase, which now resembles that of a system of constant time delay and, hence, does not saturate at−π/2. Schuller et al, however, could only numerically evaluate the model and were not able to provide analytical expressions. In a succeed- ing publication, Schulleret al simpliﬁed this velocity model by neglecting the axial decay and the lateral velocity component satisfying continuity, which led to an analytically solvable problem. Later, Preethamet al and Cuquel et al seized on the original idea of Baillot et al of the incompressible convective velocity model and were able to provide analytical solutions using again the frame- work of Fleiﬁlet al. They, however, discarded the axial decay of the velocity perturbation imposed by Schuller et al. Their model overpredicts the gain at high frequencies, but provides good estimates of the phase. The incompressible convective model, became the predominant low-order model for acoustically induced ﬂow-ﬂame interactions. Since Schulleret al introduced it to the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics, it has been used (with slight modiﬁcations) for a great variety of studies. For example, it was used to study non-linear thermoacoustic oscillations, the dynamics of bluff-body stabilized ﬂames subjected to longitudinal acoustic forcing, the non-linear behavior of the ﬂame response for high amplitude forcing or to study the impact of stretch and exothermicity on the ﬂame response. This model hence became state of the art, however, as already indicated in Sec. 2.02.02, a discussion on the physical justiﬁcation of the imposed axially convected velocity perturbation arose. Finally, it should be mentioned that linear models can equally be evaluated in fre- quency and time domain. In the formulations mentioned above, harmonic velocity forcing was assumed, which leads to a description of the response behavior in fre- quency domain when combined with the 1 D linearized G-equation framework, see Schulleret al or Preetham et al. Blumenthal et al assumed a unit 2.04 Summary impulse forcing of the ﬂame following a Dirac distribution δ(t ). For such a forcing, the incompressible convective velocity model of Eq. (2.05) transforms to u′ 1 = δ ( t − x L u 1 ), u′ 2 = x L 2 u 1 δ′ ( t − x L u 1 ) (2.06) for the two velocity components. Combined with the G-equation formalism, such a forcing leads to a time domain representation of the linear response behavior, which can be transformed to frequency domain. Similarly, any frequency domain represen- tation can be mapped to the time domain. One signiﬁcant advantage of the time do- main perspective regards the improved identiﬁcation of causalities, see Appendix A.3 for more details. A second related advantage concerns the clear separation and char- acterization of physical processes: Following Blumenthalet al, an impulsive forcing results in two clearly separated processes, an axially moving source of ﬂame front displacement and a process that restores the original ﬂame front. Each of these processes can be associated with a characteristic time scale, which allows for a nat- ural deﬁnition of a Strouhal number, for example. Conversely, in frequency domain, one has to deal with the fact that the observable ﬂame front displacement at a certain location is the superposition of past displacements provoked anywhere upstream of that point, which complicates the analysis. 2.04 Summary In this chapter the body of literature concerning the dynamics of acoustically per- turbed burner-stabilized ﬂames was reviewed from an thermoacoustic point of view. In a ﬁrst step, the problem under consideration was speciﬁed by imposing constraints on the burner geometry and the mixture properties. The literature on acoustics-ﬂame interactions was analyzed, starting with freely propagating ﬂame sheets and then moving on to burner-stabilized ﬂames. Subsequently, available low-order modeling concepts were reviewed, which are mostly based on a 1 D linearized G-equation ap- proach that is excited by convected velocity perturbations. One important outcome of this chapter is that not only low-order modeling strategies but also a signiﬁcant part of the notion of the dynamics of acoustically perturbed ﬂames relies on the concept of convected velocity perturbations. This concept, how- ever is paradoxical: On the one hand, it is assumed that the ﬂame front is locally displaced by axially convected velocity perturbations, on the other, it is stated that these perturbations are a consequence of ﬂame front wrinkling. Obviously, one of these contradictory ﬁndings needs to be wrong. Interestingly, studies on ﬂames whose anchoring is displaced mechanically exhibit a very similar dynamics as acoustically perturbed ﬂames, since both ways of forcing essentially act at the ﬂame base region. Nevertheless, the analysis of the mechanically forced conﬁgurations does not rely on convected velocity perturbations, but rather on the fundamentals introduced in Chap. 1. This should provide some hints how to resolve the paradox described above. Acoustic Response of Burner-Stabilized Flames Part II Analysis of Acoustics-Flame Interactions of Slit Flames So far, a review of the fundamental principles and modeling strategies regarding the acoustic response of premixed laminar ﬂames has been provided. A variety of phenomena have been identiﬁed that need to be organized in a clear way. For that reason, Chaps. 1 and 2 presented the analysis of acoustically burner-stabilized ﬂames as a continuation and extension of the studies on freely propagating ﬂame sheets. This allows for a clear separation of the relevant canonical governing mechanisms, similar to how it has already been done for the case of ﬂames whose anchoring is displaced mechanically. Contrary to the underlying idea of the structure of Part I, in the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics, the understanding and modeling of acoustically per- turbed burner-stabilized ﬂames is essentially based on the notion of con- vected velocity perturbations. In order to provide a new perspective on the topic and to resolve the paradox consequences of the assumption of such convected perturbations, this Part of the thesis focuses rather on the dynamics of the acoustic ﬁeld and the ﬂame sheet than on the kinemat- ics of the ﬂow ﬁeld upstream of the combustion zone. Therefore, Chap. 3 presents a new ﬁrst principle-based low-order modeling approach. Based on it, Chap. 4 analyzes the interactions of acoustic perturbations with the ﬂame sheet neglecting ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. Finally, Chap. 5 investigates the consequences of such a feedback from the ﬂame onto the ﬂow. Parts of Chaps. 3 and 4 have already been published, see Steinbacher et al. Compared to this publication, signiﬁcant changes have been applied: Essentially, the underlying modeling concept is introduced in more detail, now having a wider scope, and a Kutta condition is applied. Consequently, also the discussion and analysis of the results is updated. Nevertheless, the general statements and results of the original publication remain un- changed. 3 Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework A new low-order modeling framework for the interaction of acous- tics with premixed ﬂames is introduced. It relies on a Helmholtz decomposition combined with a ﬂow-ﬁeld representation based on ﬂow-ﬁeld singularities and a conformal mapping technique. The vis- cous mechanism of vortex shedding is included by use of a Kutta condition. Low-order modeling approaches naturally require a simpliﬁcation strategy that is often based on a decomposition of the overall problem into several simpler ones according to a predeﬁned criterion. In this work, a Helmholtz-Decomposition based approach is chosen, which splits the ﬂow into two contributions: an irrotational part that obeys to a ﬂow potential, and a solenoidal or vortical part that identically satisﬁes continuity. The former is again split into a constant density and a ﬂow expansion part that takes the combustion related density changes and the therewith accompanied acceleration of the ﬂow into account. In doing so, it is easy to switch-off feedback of the ﬂame onto the ﬂow, as will be done in Chap. 4 to analyze primary acoustic-ﬂame interactions. On the other hand, it also allows for a rather straight forward analysis of consequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, which will be discussed in Chap. 5. Decomposing the ﬂow ﬁeld into irrotational and solenoidal parts simpliﬁes the ﬂow problem by imposing some structure. For the purpose of allowing for a low-order treatment, however, some more simpliﬁcations are required. Hence, a slightly com- pressible 2 D (slit) ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid is assumed. In doing so, the overall ﬂow-ﬁeld can be constructed from a number of ﬂow-ﬁeld singularities, i. e. point sources and vortices. Applying a conformal mapping technique accounting for the boundary con- ditions, the rather complex dynamics of the overall system boils down to a number of less complex canonical problems. Special focus is put on the implementation of a Kutta condition, which accounts for viscous effects in the vicinity of sharp edges. A Slit ﬂame conﬁguration is choosen since it allows for a signiﬁcantly simpler ana- lytical treatment than conical ones. It will be explained in Chap. 6 how to relate the obtained results to other ﬂame geometries. Sec. 3.01 introduces the general idea of the chosen modeling approach that is based on the well-known Helmholtz-Decomposition. Based on this idea, acoustics-ﬂame- ﬂow interactions are analyzed and three perturbation ﬂow modes are identiﬁed. In Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework Sec. 3.02, the considered problem is explicated in detail and the associated govern- ing equations are derived. Sec. 3.03 introduces a low-order method for solving the posed problem relying on a ﬁnite number of ﬂow ﬁeld singularities combined with a conformal mapping technique and a Kutta condition adopted from aero-acoustics. 3.01 Helmholtz Decomposition Any vector ﬁeldu can be decomposed into an irrotational ui and a vortical uω part. While the former is deﬁned as the gradient of a potential φ ui = ∇φ, (3.01) the latter is computed from the curl of a vector potential ψ uω = ∇ ×ψ, (3.02) where ∇ =∂/∂xi denotes the nabla operator and “ ×” the cross-product. In doing so, the divergence of the overall ﬁeld u = ui + uω solely depends on ui, since ∇ ·u = ∇2 φ, and the curl of it solely on uω, since ∇ ×u = −∇2 ψ. Here, “ ·” indicates a scalar product and ∇2 = ∂2 / (∂xi ∂xi ) the Laplace operator. This approach is known as the Helmholtz Theorem or Helmholtz Decomposition. Why is this theorem useful for the analysis of acoustically perturbed ﬂames? The main reason for this is based on the fact that irrotational and vortical ﬂow components exhibit very different characteristics and properties, which help to bring some order into the complex ﬁeld of acoustics-ﬂame-ﬂow interactions. The ﬂow ﬁeld of irrota- tional disturbances depends at every instant in time solely on the prevailing boundary conditions, such as the pressure at the in- and outlet, while the one of vortical pertur- bations is capable of showing transient phenomena not instantaneously governed by the boundaries. Lord Kelvin reﬂected this fact in his deﬁnition of a vortex as“. a portion of ﬂuid having any motion that it could not acquire by ﬂuid pressure transmit- ted through itself from its boundary”(Thomson, p. 225(§20)). It should be kept in mind that here the term vortex is used in order to describe the angular velocity of a point in continuous space, which would nowadays be rather referred to asvorticity. It is deﬁned as the curl of the velocity ﬁeld, i. e. ω = ∇ ×u. Another important property was found by Chu and Kovasznay who showed that three modes of ﬂuid motion can be identiﬁed: sound, vorticity and entropy. Far away from any boundary, they hardly interact with each other, such that any given vorticity or entropy perturbation is convected as afrozen pattern. This agrees with the ﬁndings of Helmholtz stating that simple vortical structures are rather stable and stay well separated in space while they are transported by the local ﬂow velocity. In this chapter, only the sound and vorticity ﬂow mode shall be considered since our analysis is limited to perfectly premixed ﬂames that should, particularly in the limit of 3.01 Helmholtz Decomposition Figure 3.01: Overview of acoustics-ﬂame-ﬂow interactions. For evaluation of the (thermo-) acoustic ﬂame response, sound perturbations serve as an input and ﬂuctuations of the global heat release or the local ﬂame displacement as an output of the considered system. low Mach numbers and complete combustion, not exhibit any entropic perturbations. T o summarize the discussion so far, the irrotational component of a velocity ﬁeld depends solely on the instantaneous values of pressure and velocity at the boundaries, while the vortical one features convected, well separated structures (note that the analysis is limited to laminar ﬂows!). In order to exploit this knowledge for the sake of bringing some order into the problem at hand, Fig. 3.01 shows an overview of acoustics-ﬂame-ﬂow interactions. Here, additionally to the aforementioned two ﬂow modes, aﬂame mode is introduced, where ﬂame displacements are transported along the steady state ﬂame by a velocity u∥, see Sec. 1.02.04. It is usually accompanied by both vortical and irrotational ﬂow perturbations proportional to the local ﬂame displacement — details will be provided in Chap. 5. Since we are interested in the (thermo-) acoustic response of a ﬂame, the sound ﬂow mode constitutes the input of the analyzed system and changes of the global heat release rate, which result in a monopole-like source of sound, the output. Any immediate response to an impulsive input forcing of the system can predominately be assigned to direct interactions of the sound ﬁeld with the ﬂame, while any delayed output has to be attributed to memory- like effects of the vorticity and the ﬂame mode. W e now have a closer look at the irrotational sound ﬂow mode, which inherently neglects ﬂow separation. The perturbation velocity ﬁeld is thus computed as the gra- dient of an acoustic potentialφ, which obeys a non-dimensional wave equation He 2 ∂2 φ∗ ∂t ∗2 − ∇2 φ∗ = 0 (3.03) with the Helmholtz number He. The speed of sound is assumed to be constant and Mach numbers are low. Assuming that the characteristic length required for comput- Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework ing He is the length of the ﬂame, we can express the Helmholtz number as a product of the Mach number Ma and the Strouhal number, i. e.He = Ma f ∗. Strouhal num- bers of interest for FTFs are at maximum of the order O (10), see Chap. 4, and Mach numbers of order O ( 10−2 ). Hence, He can be considered to be of maximum order O ( 10−1 ), which allows to safely drop the time dependent term in Eq. (3.03) for fur- ther analysis. The domain of interest is hence acoustically compact, which simpliﬁes Eq. (3.03) to the now dimensional equation ∇2 φ = 0. (3.04) Consequently, the acoustic ﬂow mode is governed by a Laplace equation and in the following we refer to the low Helmholtz number regime as the regime of compact acoustics. Having discussed the properties of a Helmholtz decomposition and having introduced an overview of the relevant interactions governing the ﬂame response in Fig. 3.01, the ﬁeld is set to explicate the modeling approach pursued In this chapter as well as to introduce the investigated test case setups, which will be provided in the next two sections. 3.02 Problem Formulation and Governing Equations A symmetric conﬁguration as depicted in Fig. 3.02 shall be considered, where a Slit type ﬂame is stabilized above a jet of perfectly premixed lean air-fuel mix- ture and excited by upstream velocity perturbations whose bulk value is given by u′ 1,blk (t ) = 1/Ri ∫ Ri 0 u′ 1 (x 2, t )dx 2. Assuming a high activation energy of the global chemical reaction and a Lewis number of about unity, the overall ﬂow problem is split into a large-scale hydrodynamic and a thin, quasi-1 D combustion zone, see Chap. 1. A low Mach number macroscopic ﬂow is assumed, which is regarded to beslightly compressible in the sense that density is only affected by the combustion process. Furthermore, the analysis shall be restricted to a 2 D ideal ﬂuid (zero vis- cosity, thermal and mass diffusivity) without any volume or body forces. V iscous effects will be incorporated by use of a Kutta conditions. This results in a ﬂow prob- lem that is governed by ∇ ·u = −1 ρ Dρ Dt (3.05) Du Dt = −1 ρ ∇p, (3.06) where D(.)/Dt = ∂(.)/∂t + u · ∇(.) is the material derivative and u, ρ and p denote ﬂow velocity, density and pressure, respectively. The density-gradient dependent source term on the right-hand side of continuity Eq. (3.05) vanishes everywhere but in the immediate vicinity of the ﬂame front. Here 3.02 Problem Formulation and Governing Equations Figure 3.02: A Slit type ﬂame is stabilized above a stream of unburned mixture (“u”) with a bulk ﬂow velocity u 1,blk and subjected to upstream bulk veloc- ity perturbations u′ 1,blk. The ﬂame propagates normal to itself by a ﬂame front curvature κ dependent speed s L and acts as a volume source of strength m. T wo coordinate systems are used, namely laboratory coor- dinates (x 1, x 2 ) and ﬂame aligned coordinates (x∥, x⊥) where x⊥ points along the local ﬂame normal direction towards the burned gas (“b”). it acts as a source of volume, which leads to a volume production per unit length of the ﬂame ofm = E s L, where E = ρu /ρb − 1 denotes the non-dimensional density increase and the indices “u” and “b” indicate a quantity of the unburned and burned ﬂow, respectively. Introducing a kernel D (x⊥) capturing the spatial distribu- tion of the volume production along the ﬂame normal direction x⊥, see Fig. 3.02, Eq. (3.05) can be rewritten as ∇ ·u = m D ( d ( x, x f )) (3.07) with ∫ ∞ −∞ D (x )dx = 1 and d ( x, x f ) denoting the distance from a point x to the ﬂame front x f. T aking the curl of the momentum Equation (3.06) leads to a transport equation for vorticityω Dω Dt = 1 ρ2 ( ∇ρ × ∇p ). (3.08) Here, the dilatation term −ω(∇ ·u) was neglected since it only is non-zero right at the ﬂame front and the unburned ﬂow ﬁeld is assumed to be free of vorticity. Further- more, Matalonet al argued that contributions of this term are negligible across the ﬂame sheet. Thus, for 2 D inviscid ﬂows, the dominant source term of the vortic- ity transport equation is the baroclinic tourque, which arises from a misalignment of Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework Figure 3.03: Illustration of a parcel of ﬂuid exhibiting a horizontal gradient in density ρ(∝ shade of gray) that is exposed to a vertical gradient in pressure p leading to a force F accelerating the parcel. Due to the density gradient, the center of gravity of the ﬂuid parcel (red line) is shifted away from the geometrical center (black line) and, hence, the parcel of ﬂuid would start to rotate in counter-clockwise direction. the pressure and density gradients, see Fig. 3.03. For a detailed and rather complete description of how vorticity interacts with a ﬂame sheet, it is referred to the works of Hayes and Berndt. W e eliminate the pressure term in Eq. (3.08) by use of Eq. (3.06) and obtain Dω Dt = 1 ρ ( Du Dt × ∇ρ ρ ) (3.09). From the left-hand side of this equation it becomes clear that, in the absence of any density gradient∇ρ, vorticity is transported like a massless particle. The move- ment of any hypothetical point vortex whose spatial position may be deﬁned by xω is governed by d xω d t = u (xω) (3.010) with u (xω) being the ﬂow velocity right at the vortex position. Using Eqs. (3.07) and (3.09), the ﬂow problem depicted in Fig. 3.02 is solved by de- composing the ﬂow ﬁeldu into two irrotational parts uc and ue, where the former is caused by a pressure difference between in- and outlet of the domain initiating the volume ﬂux through the combustor. The latter captures effects of the volume ex- pansion across the ﬂame. Further, a vortical partuω is introduced that represents the rotational parts of the ﬂow ﬁeld. In summary, the decomposition is written as u = uc + ue + uω, (3.011) see. While the irrotational components each have a potential uc /e = ∇φc /e, the vortical component depends on a stream function via uω = ∇ ×ψω. Application of these relations, together with continuity Equation (3.07) and the de- 3.02 Problem Formulation and Governing Equations composition of Eq. (3.011) results in the three Poisson equations ∇2 φc = 2 ˙V (t ) Ri δ(x 1 − x 1,EF ) (3.012) ∇2 φe = m D ( d ( x, x f )) (3.013) ∇2 ψω = −ω (3.014) with the Laplace operator ∇2 = ∂2 / (∂xi ∂xi ). Note that uc is subject to a line source at x 1,EF = −∞, which generates a volume ﬂux ˙V (t ) = [ u 1,blk + u′ 1,blk ] Ri ∆x 3 through the combustor that is driven by a potential (or pressure) gradient between x 1 = −∞and x 1 = +∞. All boundaries shall be impermeable and the axial velocity gradients shall vanish far up- and downstream the ﬂame: ∂u/∂x 1 |±∞ = 0. Note that Eq. (3.012) con- stitutes the non-homogeneous equivalent to the Laplace Eq. (3.04), which was derived from the acoustic wave equation. The dynamics of the ﬂame sheet is captured by the G-equation approach, as expli- cated in Sec. 1.03. The G -ﬁeld, so far, has no other physical meaning than the fact that its zero iso-line represents the instantaneous position of the ﬂame front. Therefore, we are in principle free to deﬁne it to any spatial function as long as the position of the zero iso-line remains untouched (excluding numerical issues). For the problem at hand, it is beneﬁcial to deﬁne G to be a signed distance function, i. e. its value at a position G (x ) represents the distance from this point to the ﬂame front located at G (x f ) = 0. This property allows for a straight forward evaluation of the argument of the function D (x ) in Eq. (3.013) as d ( x, x f ) ≡ G (x ). The G-equation writes DG Dt = s 0 L ( 1 + l M ∇ · ∇G ||∇G || ) ||∇G ||. (3.015) and, consequently, its dynamics depends on the underlying ﬂow ﬁeld as well as on the local, stretch dependent ﬂame speed. Here, only ﬂame stretch related to ﬂame curvature is considered, whose importance is quantiﬁed by the Markstein lengthl M, which is a length of the order of the ﬂame thickness. Inserting G = x⊥ − ξ(x∥, t ) into Eq. (3.015) and linearizing the resulting expression with respect to ξ leads to a 1 D description of the ﬂame front in ﬂame aligned coordinates ∂ξ ∂t + u∥ ∂ξ ∂x∥ = u′ ⊥ + l M s 0 L ∂2 ξ ∂x 2 ∥ (3.016) where u∥ denotes the mean ﬂow velocity in ﬂame-parallel direction. Eq. (3.09) together with Eqs. (3.012)-(3.014) and (3.015) deﬁne the ﬂow problem. Ad- ditionally, in the case of E > 0, a volume production kernel D has to be deﬁned. One major difﬁculty in solving this problem constitutes the impermeability boundary conditions together with the non-trivial considered geometry (backward facing step combustor), another the trailing edge where the ﬂow separates. In this work, we ad- dress the former issue by use of a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping technique and the latter by application of a Kutta condition at the trailing edge. Both are introduced in the following. Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework (a) Physical domain (b) Image domain Figure 3.04: Illustration of the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping (not to scale). Mean ﬂame position ( ) and straight lines radiating from the origin of the image domain ( ), each in the physical and the image domain. Fur- ther, a point vortex, as well as its mirror vortex in the image domain, are drawn at the shear layer. 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique The problem formulated in Sec. 3.02 has already — in similar form — been solved numerically by several studies, see for example the works of Pindera and T albot and Rheeet al. In this thesis, however, a low-order formulation is desired. Therefore, the chosen solution approach is essentially based on three points: (1) The impermeability boundary conditions are satisﬁed by use of a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping technique, (2) the ﬂow ﬁeld is decomposed into a ﬁnite set of ﬂow ﬁeld singularities, i. e. point sources and point vortices, and the ﬂame front dynamics is captured by a 1 D linearized G-equation approach as shown in Eq. (3.016) and (3) in order to avoid inﬁnitely high velocities at the anchoring point, a Kutta condition is employed. These approaches are one by one explicated in the following. 3.03.01 Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping The Poisson Eqs. (3.012)–(3.014) are solved on the geometry of interest by use of a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping technique. The inner of the physical ﬂow domain is mapped to the imaginary positive half of a complex image domain. By doing so, the ﬂow problem is split into a mapping problem simplifying and unifying the boundary conditions and a canonical ﬂow problem in the image domain. Schwarz-Christoffel mappings are conformal mappings, i. e. they locally preserve angles and orienta- tions. These kind of transformations are complex valued functions of the form ξ= f (x ) that rotate and scale line elements in the approximate vicinity of a point x 0 by an angle arg [ d f (x 0 )/dx ] and a factor ⏐ ⏐d f (x 0 )/dx ⏐ ⏐, respectively. From this property it follows that solutions of Laplace’s equation in the image domain are also solutions of Laplace’s equation in the physical domain, see Howe (Sec. 3.05). Consequently, such a mapping can be applied to solve the given set of Eqs. (3.012)-(3.014). 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique The coordinate system used to describe the combustor shown in Fig. 3.02 is illustrated in Fig. 3.04. Due to symmetry, we limit ourselves to only one half of the domain. Complex variables are used to describe the 2 D problem: Coordinates in the physical domain are represented byx = x 1 + i x 2 where x 1 denotes the axial and x 2 the spatial direction, perpendicular to the ﬁrst. Accordingly, velocities are expressed by u = u 1 + i u 2. In the image domain, the complex variable ξ = ξ1 + i ξ2 is used to specify location. All corners of the ﬂow domain are named by capital letters (A to E) and are mapped to points on the real axis of the image domain. At edge A, the feed channel opens into the combustion chamber. This edge is mapped toξ = 1. Points E and F are located at x 1 = −∞in the physical domain and are mapped to ξ = 0 in the image domain. The mapping is deﬁned by x (ξ) = Ra π [ cosh−1 ( 2 C 2 r ξ− 1 −C 2 r 1 −C 2 r ) −Cr cosh−1 ( (1 +C 2 r )ξ− 2 (1 −C 2 r )ξ )] (3.017) with the conﬁnement ratio Cr = Ri /Ra. This mapping can only be inverted nu- merically, therefore, evaluation of ξ(x ) requires the application of a numerical root ﬁnding algorithm. The complex conjugate, denoted by˜(.), of the velocity in the physical domain is computed by application of the chain rule ˜u(x ) = d φ(ξ(x )) d ξ d ξ(x ) d x. (3.018) The ﬁrst term in this equation is the derivative of the ﬂow potential φ with respect to the image domain coordinate ξ, the second the ﬁrst derivative of the mapping with respect to the physical coordinate x. The latter writes for the combustor geometry d ξ(x ) d x = πξ(x ) Ra [ ξ(x ) −C −2 r ξ(x ) − 1 ] 1. (3.019) Using these relations, we are able to compute the velocity ﬁeld in the physical domain due to any potentialφ(ξ) given in the image domain. Knowing that any point source or vortex maps to its counterpart in the image domain by conserving its strength — i. e. volume production and circulation, respectively — and vice versa, we are able to deﬁne a potential ﬁeld as the superposition of several point sources and vortices. By mapping these points to the image domain, Eq. (3.018) can be used in order to compute the associated physical velocity ﬁeld that complies with the boundary conditions. This process is explicated in more detail in the following section. 3.03.02 Flow-Field Singularities The solution of a Poisson equation∇2 φ = c together with a set of boundary condi- tions and a Dirac Delta function as non-homogeneous part c = δ(x − x ′) is known as Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework the Green’s function G ( x, x ′) of this problem. Here, the Dirac Delta function con- stitutes a point source whose 2 D-spatial position is given by x ′ = (x ′ 1, x ′ 2 ). Knowing the respective Green’s function, the solution of the Poisson equation for an arbitrary non-homogeneous partc (x ) is computed as the spatial convolution of the Green’s function with a given c (x ). Simplifying the problem by assuming free-space bound- ary conditions, i. e. the potential φ asymptots to zero at inﬁnity, a so-called free-space Green’s function G ( x, x ′) = 1 2π ln [ √ ( x 1 − x ′ )2 + ( x 2 − x ′ )2 ] (3.020) emerges. By mapping the non-homogeneous part of a Poisson equation to the image domain, a solution that is conform with the impermeability boundary conditions at the walls is easily constructed by solely relying on free-space Green’s functions. This simpliﬁes the analysis and will be explicated in the following. First of all, we need to constitute that there are two types of non-homogeneous functions, which are volume sources and vortices, see Eqs. (3.012)–(3.014). Applying Green’s Function (3.020) in the image domain (complex coordinateξ), the complex conjugate of the irrotational velocity component due to a point source of strength S at position ξ′ becomes ˜uc /e (ξ, t ) = S 2π ξ− ξ′. (3.021) Similarly, we get for the solenoidal (vortical) velocity due to a point vortex of strength Γat the same position ˜uω(ξ, t ) = −i Γ 2π ξ− ξ′. (3.022) In the image domain, all walls are mapped to the real axis. Therefore, in order to fulﬁll the impermeability boundary conditions at all walls, mirror sources of equal strength Sare placed in the lower half of the complex plane by mirroring the source locations at the real axis. This simply corresponds to computing the complex conjugate of the original source position˜ξ′. Equivalently, mirror vortices of opposite strength are introduced. In doing so, velocity components normal to the real axis vanish and the volume ﬂux through all walls is zero. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.05 for a single vortex. In the proposed model, the vortical part of the overall perturbation velocity ﬁeld is approximated by a ﬁnite number of N point vortices of strengths ∆Γ′ n, which results in an expression for the velocity in the image domain of ˜uω(ξ, t ) = − i 2π N∑ n=1 ∆Γ′ n ξ′ n− ˜ξ′ n (ξ− ξ′ n)(ξ− ˜ξ′ n), (3.023) where mirror vortices of opposite circulation have been placed at the complex conju- gate coordinates˜ξ′ n of all vortices. The potential part of the perturbation velocity ﬁeld that drives the volume ﬂux through the combustor can be computed by placing a source of strength S (t ) = 2 u′ 1 (t )Ri (3.024) 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique (a) Physical domain (b) Image domain Figure 3.05: Illustration of how impermeability boundary conditions are met by use of a mirror vortex (not to scale): the wall normal velocity component of the original vortex of strength∆Γ′ (green) is canceled by its mirror counterpart (pink) such that the resulting velocity (red) is parallel to the walls in the image (3.05 b) as well as in the physical domain (3.05 a). Here, the shear layer and the ﬂame front are shown as blue dashed and red dotted lines, respectively. at ξEF = 0 since all points of x 1 → −∞are mapped to a single point in the image domain (EF). Following Eq. (3.021), the complex conjugate of the associated velocity ﬁeld is computed in the image domain as ˜uc (ξ, t ) = S (t ) 2πξ. (3.025) Resulting stream lines are shown in green in Fig. 3.04, one time in the image and one time in the physical domain. 3.03.03 Kutta Condition Following Eqs. (3.018) and (3.019), the ﬂow ﬁeld of the combustor geometry exhibits a O ( (ξ− 1)−1/2 ) singularity at edge A, which results from the fact that, in reality, a viscous ﬂow cannot follow the abrupt 90◦ turn of the wall contour, since this would require an inﬁnitely high pressure gradient. The lack of such high gradients leads to the separation of the ﬂow and vorticity, originally bound in the wall boundary layer, is shed into the inner region of the ﬂow domain. In the modeling framework adopted here, this singularity is removed by employing a Kutta condition. Its application re- covers a ﬁnite-valued velocity at the edge, which can only be ensured by demanding d φ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1! = 0, (3.026) Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework see Eq. (3.018). In order to meet this condition, vorticity is introduced in the vicinity of edge A, which implies the formation of a thin shear layer. It should be pointed out that in the case of an anchored ﬂame, getting rid of the singularity is compulsory since otherwise the inﬁnitely high velocity at the anchoring would lead to unbound displacement amplitudes at this point. Concerning the validity of a Kutta condition, at least some qualitative statements can be found in the literature. Crighton published an extensive review article on the Kutta condition in unsteady ﬂows stating that“within restricted parameter ranges, only those ‘outer’ potential ﬂows that satisfy a Kutta condition are, in general, com- patible (in the matched asymptotic expansion sense) with an acceptable multilay- ered ‘inner’ viscous structure”(Crighton, p.412). Williams made a more cautious statement in a review article on aeroacoustics: “There is no proof that the solution obtained through the matched-expansion scheme is, in fact, a solution of the real problem — but it usually is [. ]”(Williams, p.449). Generally, in the ﬁeld of aero-acoustics, application of a Kutta condition is considered to be an acceptable principle for modeling ﬂows around sharp edges. The results computed in this chapter compare well with the CFD/SI data and hence conﬁrm the aforementioned assertions, as will be shown below. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that a Kutta condition does not naturally appear when simplifying the govern- ing equations of a viscid ﬂow but rather has to be viewed as an ad hoc hypothesis that allows to incorporate viscous effects into an inherently inviscid ﬂow description. In the literature, several methods have been proposed in order to implement a Kutta condition. A method relying on a single vortex ensuring a ﬁnite valued velocity at a sharp edge of a acoustically excited ﬂow of zero mean ﬂow was ﬁrst developed by Brown and Michael. It was adopted by several later studies, e. g. The idea of this approach is that during both the positive and negative part of a forcing cycle, shed vorticity accumulates in a single vortex, which represents the rolled up shear layer. A more advanced method is thesingle panel method [124, 189–191], which intro- duces a vortex sheet (the panel) of length Hx and constant strength γx that is attached to the trailing edge. The strength and length of this sheet depend on the instantaneous ﬂow ﬁeld and are set such that the edge singularity is removed. At each time step, the circulation conﬁned to the sheet is condensed into one point vortex and advected by the local ﬂow velocity. The work presented in this chapter relies on such a single panel method. The shape of the vortex panel is deﬁned by two geometrical parameters: Its length Hξ and its angle with respect to the real axis βξ, both measured in the image domain as illustrated in Fig. 3.06. Ideally, the strength of the vortex sheet in the physical domain γx (x ) = d Γ(x ) d x (3.027) is constant, where Γ= ∫ A ωd S is the circulation, deﬁned as the integral of vorticity ω 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique Figure 3.06: Flow ﬁeld according to source at ξ = 0 and a Kutta panel (green), shown for the whole combustor (top). Additionall, a close up view of the Kutta panel is shown in the physical (bottom left) and the image domain (bot- tom right), with Cr = 0.04, Hξ = 2.01 and βξ = π/3. over an area A. W e, therefore, need to deﬁne the panel strength in the image domain γξ(ξ) such that it maps back to a constant distribution in the physical domain γx (x ). Following the chain rule, we get γx = γξ d ξ d x (3.028) and, hence, we would have to impose a distribution of γξ ∝ dx /dξ in the image do- main in order to get a constant value in the physical domain. W e call this the ideal distribution of vorticity in the following. The ﬂow ﬁeld corresponding to such a dis- tribution, however, could not be solved analytically (by the author of this thesis). Therefore, a simpliﬁed distribution γξ(ξ′) = c 1 √ ξ′ − 1 ξ′ (3.029) is used, where ξ′ parametrizes the vortex sheet and c 1 its strength. Fig.3.07 compares the ideal vorticity distribution of dx /dξ, i. e. γξ = c 1 [ sξ/(ξ−C −2 r ) ] 1/2 /ξ ( ) with the approximation according to Eq. (3.029) ( and ). Here, sξ and sx denote the panel aligned coordinates in the image and the physical domain, respectively. It be- comes clear that the approximation is a good model in the limit of short panel lengths and low conﬁnement ratios. Note that the Cr = 0.04 and Hx /Ri = 0.04 case corresponds Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework 0 0. 5 10 0. 5 1. 5 Cr = 0. 4: Hξ = 0. 33 Cr = 0. 66: Hξ = 0. 28 sξ /H ξ γξ /γ ref,ξ 0 0. 5 10 0. 5 1. 5 Hx/R i = 0. 04 sx/H x γx/γ ref,x 0 0. 5 1 Cr = 0. 4: Hξ = 2. 1 Cr = 0. 66: Hξ = 1. 8 sξ /H ξ 0 0. 5 1 Hx/R i = 0. 4 sx/H x Figure 3.07: Normalized vorticity plotted over panel coordinates in the image (top) and the physical (bottom) domain for two panel lengths Hx /Ri = 0.004 (left) and Hx /Ri = 0.04 (right), where Ri is kept constant. Shown are two vorticity distributions, γξ = c 1 s 1/2 ξ /ξ (, ) and γξ = c 1 [ sξ/(ξ−C −2 r ) ] 1/2 /ξ ( ). For the former, two conﬁnement ra- tios Cr = 0.04 ( ) and Cr = 0.066 ( ) are depicted, whereas for the latter both coincide two the same line. As reference vorticity γref,x /ξ, the mean vorticity along the panel was chosen. to a situation as shown in Fig. 3.06, which should provide a rough feeling of what these numbers mean. It should be kept in mind that, for a given length Hξ, a lower conﬁnement ratio corresponds to a longer panel in the physical domain. Hence, judg- ing from the results of Fig. 3.07, the lengths of such Kutta panels should be of the order of Hξ ≤ O ( 101 ) in order to have a constant distribution of vorticity in the physi- cal domain. Explicitly evaluating the vorticity distribution associated with Eq. (3.029) we get in the physical domain γx (x ) = c 1 π Ra √ ξ(x ) −C −2 r, (3.030) which states that γx (x ) stays constant along a circle around edge B ( ξB = C −2 r ). Thus, the quotient of the distance of the Kutta panel to point B over the panel length Hx needs to be large in order to have an approximately constant vorticity distribution. The angle of the panel in the image domainβξ is determined such that the ﬂow follows the wall contour of the feed duct, see Fig. 3.06. Hence, the angle between the separating shear layer and the back plate of the combustion chamber should be 90◦ right at the edge. Knowing that the angle between the feed duct wall and the back 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique Figure 3.08: Sketch of the Kutta panel (upper) and its mirror counterpart (lower) in the image domain. The starting point of the Kutta panel is namedξA and its ending ξB. plate is 270◦, which corresponds to an angle of 180◦ in the image domain, the desired 90◦ angle corresponds to βξ = 60◦ or, in radians, βξ = π/3. It will be shown below that this angle is indeed a special one, since imposing such an angle, the velocity right beneath the point where the panel is attached vanishes. W e now evaluate, for a given velocity ﬁeld, the respective panel strengthc 1 that satis- ﬁes the Kutta condition. This requires the evaluation of the velocity ﬁeld imposed by the Kutta panel. In doing so, we ﬁrstly need to evaluate the gradient of the potential φp associated with the panel in the image domain. Assuming a vorticity distribution according to Eq. (3.029) we need to evaluate an integral d φp d ξ = − i 2π ξB∫ ξA c 1 ∝∇adicallow ξ′−1 ξ′ ξ− ξ′ dξ′, (3.031) where all relevant quantities are sketched in Fig. 3.08. Solving this integral, we get d φp,u p d ξ = i π c 1 (ξ− 1) exp(−i βξ) + 1 [ arctan ( √ Hξ ) − √ (1 − ξ) exp(−i βξ) arctan ( √ Hξ (1 − ξ) exp(−i βξ) )] exp(−i βξ). (3.032) Here, the index “ u p” signiﬁes that only the potential of the original Kutta panel is respected, which is found in the upper half of the image domain as depicted in Fig. 3.08. The solution for the associated mirror panel, placed in the lower half of the complex plane (index “l ow”), is the same as the one given by Eq. (3.032), but with a negative sign and a negative angle βξ. Accordingly, it writes d φp,l ow d ξ = − i π c 1 (ξ− 1) exp(i βξ) + 1 [ arctan ( √ Hξ ) − √ (1 − ξ) exp(i βξ) arctan ( √ Hξ (1 − ξ) exp(i βξ) )] exp(i βξ). (3.033) Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework The superposition of both results in the overall expression for the panel, namely dφp /dξ. Equations (3.032) and (3.033) can now be used in order to compute the strength of the vortex sheetc 1 (including the mirror panel!). From Condition (3.026) we know that the gradient of the overall potential needs to vanish at edge A ( ξ = 1). Assuming the potential resulting from a superposition of all ﬂow ﬁeld singularities (vortices and sources) except the Kutta panel may be denoted asφΣ, this condition translates to d φp d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ→1 = −d φΣ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1. (3.034) Combining Eqs. (3.032)–(3.034) and solving for c 1 leads to c 1 = −d φΣ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1 π 2 arctan ( √ Hξ ) sin(βξ). (3.035) Using these relations and following Eq. (3.018), we can compute the complex conju- gate of the resulting ﬂow velocity in the physical domain as ˜u(x ) = d ξ d x [ d φΣ d ξ + d φp d ξ ] = d ξ d x [ d φΣ d ξ + d φp,u p d ξ + d φp,l ow d ξ ]. (3.036) This expression respects the Kutta panel as well as its mirror counterpart plus the impact of all other ﬂow ﬁeld singularities. W e now evaluate the right-hand and left- hand limits (with respect to the real part ofξ) of the velocity ﬁelds at the separation point A and get ˜u+ = lim ξ→1+ ˜u (x (ξ)) = π Ra √ 1 −C −2 r d φΣ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1 πcos ( 3 2 βξ ) 2 arctan ( √ Hξ ) sin(βξ) (3.037) and ˜u− = lim ξ→1− ˜u (x (ξ)) = −π Ra √ 1 −C −2 r d φΣ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1 i πsin ( 3 2 βξ ) 2 arctan ( √ Hξ ) sin(βξ), (3.038) respectively. If we insert βξ = π/3, the right-hand limit of Eq. (3.037) simpliﬁes to ˜u+ = 0 and the left-hand one of Eq. (3.038) to ˜u− = −π Ra √ 1 −C −2 r d φΣ d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1 i π 2 arctan ( √ Hξ ) sin ( π ). (3.039) This reﬂects the fact that the left-hand limit constitutes the jet velocity at the sepa- rating edge, while the right-hand limit evaluates the ﬂow velocity at the side of the recirculation bubble, see Fig. 3.06. From Eq. (3.039) it becomes clear that, at edge A, 3.03 Conformal Mapping T echnique Figure 3.09: Summary of all computations that need to be performed during one time step when considering a Kutta condition. multiplication of the local velocity dφΣ/dξ ⏐ ⏐ ξ=1 with the complex unit i bends the ﬂow by 90◦, which leads to the desired separation. For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that one of the major difﬁculties encountered during the derivation of the Kutta condition concerns branch cuts, which are curves across which the resulting ﬂow ﬁeld is discontinuous. In this regard a Kutta panel is such a branch cut. Hence it has to be ensured that the branch cuts associated with the Kutta panels used do not exceed their desired lengths and, in doing so, impose spurious discontinuities. In the implementation presented here, this property has been veriﬁed. Finally, it is explicated how the methods described above are used in order to numer- ically simulate the process of vortex shedding. An overview of all required compu- tations is provided in Fig. 3.09. First of all, in each time step the length of the vortex Flow-Decomposition Based Modeling Framework sheets Hξ needs to be computed, which is done by assuming a transport velocity of the vorticity bound in the separating shear layer of Uedge = ( ˜u+ + ˜u−)/2. Multi- plication of this velocity with the time step length ∆t results in the panel length in the physical domain Hx. Note that in the proposed acoustic LOM, an approximation Uedge = ublk /2 is used, which avoids the evaluation of a mean ﬂow state. This ap- proach implicitly assumes a block ﬂow proﬁle in the feed channel and zero velocity in the recirculation zone. Subsequently,Hξ is numerically evaluated as the root of Hξ∫ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ d x ( sξ(t ) ) d ξ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐ ⏐dt − Hx = 0, (3.040) where a parametrization sξ(t ) = 1 + exp(i βξ)t of the curve representing the Kutta panel is used (note that, here, t denotes the parametrization parameter not the time). Based on this length, the Kutta condition can be applied according to Eqs. (3.035),(3.032), (3.033) and (3.036). The total circulation of the resulting panel is then provided by Γ′ p = ∫ Hξ c 1 ∝∇adicallow t⏐ ⏐1 + exp(i βξ)t ⏐ ⏐dt. (3.041) After each time step, this integral is numerically evaluated employing the trapezoidal rule and its respective value ofΓ′ p propagated to a new point vortex, which is placed at end of the vortex panel from which it resulted. 3.04 Summary In this chapter, a low-order modeling approach for the dynamics of acoustically per- turbed burner-stabilized 2 D ﬂames was derived. It is essentially based on ﬁrst prin- ciples and relies on the assumption of an inviscid, slightly compressible ﬂow whose density is solely affected by the combustion process. Imposing a Helmholtz decom- position, three velocity components need to be modeled: (i) an irrotational ﬁeld re- lated to the pressure difference between in- and outlet of the domain, (ii) a second irrotational ﬁeld associated to the volume ﬂux generated by the ﬂame and (iii) a solenoidal velocity ﬁeld containing all vortical contributions. It is assumed that vor- ticity is only generated by the ﬂame sheet as well as by a Kutta condition capturing the shedding of vorticity at sharp edges. Relying on a conformal mapping technique and a ﬁnite number of ﬂow ﬁeld singular- ities, the overall problem could be split into several canonical problems. This clariﬁes the solution process and allows to simply switch certain physical mechanisms on and off in order to evaluate their individual contributions. This approach will be applied to the case of a 2 D Slit ﬂame in the following. 4 Primary Interactions Based on a rigorous analysis neglecting ﬂame-ﬂow feedback and relying on methods presented in Chap. 3, it is found that predomi- nantly irrotational velocity perturbations interact with a ﬂame hav- ing maximum impact at the base region, while the impact of shed vorticity is negligible. A signiﬁcant discrepancy between the mod- eled response and high ﬁdelity CFD data is observed, which is at- tributed to ﬂame-ﬂow feedback — a mechanism neglected in this chapter. The basic idea of this chapter is to take a ﬁrst step towards the identiﬁcation and mod- eling of the skeletal processes governing acoustics-ﬂame interactions. T o this end, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback as well as thermal-diffusive mechanisms shall be neglected and only the remaining interactions of acoustics with the ﬂame shall be analyzed. More speciﬁcally, the modeling approach introduced in the previous chapter shall be ex- ploited in order to resolve the paradoxical ﬁnding concerning the convective velocity model explained in Chap. 2. This model assumes that acoustically excited premixed (Bunsen) ﬂames are subject to convected velocity perturbations, which are responsi- ble for the observed wrinkling of the ﬂame front. Several studies, however, demon- strated that these convected perturbations are rather a consequence than a source of ﬂame front wrinkles, caused by a feedback of the ﬂame on the ﬂow. Therefore, the as- sumption of convected velocity perturbations seems to violate causality (they cannot be source and consequence at the same time). In this chapter, it shall be investigated if vortex shedding imposes signiﬁcant levels of convected velocity perturbations onto the ﬂame front. If that is the case, causality may at least partly be respected by con- vective velocity models. From an analytical point of view, it has to be noted that acoustic perturbations propa- gate at the speed of sound and, consequently, a convective ﬂow perturbation cannot be assigned to the acoustic ﬂow mode. Thus, an acoustic-to-hydrodynamic mode conver- sion is required in order to generate perturbations that are transported with the local ﬂow velocity. Following Fig. 3.01, one possible candidate for such a mode conversion mechanism is the process of ﬂow separation, which can happen at sharp corners, e. g. at a backward-facing step or bluff body ﬂame holder. At the separation point, vor- ticity, originally conﬁned to the wall boundary layers, is shed into the interior of the ﬂow domain. Transient (acoustic) forcing of a separating ﬂow leads to unsteady gen- eration and shedding of vorticity. V ortical structures that are advected Primary Interactions downstream by the ﬂow represent an acoustic damping mechanism and may — more important in the context of this study — interact with the ﬂame front. Using a 2 D compressible ﬂow solver, which allowed to artiﬁcially modify the gas expansion, Schlimpert et al showed for an unconﬁned ﬂame that vortical structures sig- niﬁcantly affect the ﬂame front in the case of negligible gas expansion. With realistic gas expansion, however, the inﬂuence of shed vorticity is substantial only right at the ﬂame base. In this Chapter the issue of ﬂow-ﬂame interactions is revisited by decomposing the acoustic velocity disturbance into an irrotational potential and a solenoidal vortical ﬁeld and analyzing how both interact with the ﬂame. For this purpose, the modeling framework introduced in Chap. 3 is adopted and applied to the analysis of acoustic- ﬂow-ﬂame interactions at a duct singularity. Of particular interest is an assessment of the impact of shed vorticity on the ﬂame front and if and how it contributes to the con- vective nature of the FTF. In order to suppress the occurrence of vortical structures due to ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, we neglect exothermicity/gas expansion in the pertur- bations. This assumption is in line with the assumptions of the convective velocity model. The mean ﬂow ﬁeld, required to compute vortex advection, is nevertheless retrieved from exothermic numerical simulations. In this chapter, the effect of gas expansion is explicitly excluded from the analysis, i. e.E = 0. Thus, due to m = 0, Eq. (3.013) drops from the analysis and the baroclinic tourque source term vanishes, which eliminates the right-hand side of Eq. (3.09). In the remaining problem, the only source of vorticity is vortex shedding. T o simplify the analysis, curvature (stretch) effects are neglected and hencel M ≡ 0. Sec. 4.01 introduces the speciﬁc test case setups as well as the high-ﬁdelity CFD re- sults, which serve as validation cases of the developed model. The resulting low-order model is then analyzed and compared to high ﬁdelity CFD data in terms of ﬂame sheet and global heat release dynamics in Sec. 4.02. 4.01 T est Case Setups The modeling framework derived in this chapter is applied to a backward facing step combustor, as shown in Fig. 4.01. Conﬁgurations of two different conﬁnement ratios Cr = Ri /Ra of Cr = 0.04 (upper half) and Cr = 0.066 (bottom half) are analyzed, with Ri denoting the feed channel and Ra the combustion chamber half width. The coloring represents the steady state velocity ﬁeld resulting from a 2 D incompressible CFD simulation with a reduced chemical kinetic 2-step mechanism (2 S-CM 2) as described in Appendix. A. The area of maximum heat release is shown in green color in Fig. 4.01 ( ). An estimate of the shear layer position ( ) as well as the steady state ﬂame front of length L f, as predicted by the 1 D linearized G-equation approach introduced in Sec. 1.03.02 ( l M ≡ 0), ( ) are indicated. Note, that other than for conical conﬁgurations, the conﬁnement ratio does not impact the ﬂame height of 2 D 4.02 Irrotational and V ortical Response Analysis Figure 4.01: CFD steady state snapshots of absolute velocity for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.04 (upper half) and Cr = 0.066 (bottom half).

The mean inlet velocity of the lean methane-air mixture of equivalence ratio 0.08 is set to 1 m/s. The feed channel half-width is Ri = 5 mm for both setups and all bound- aries are adiabatic, except the back-plate of the combustion chamber, which is set to a temperature of TBP = 373 K. All walls are no-slip walls. The Reynolds number, computed with the mean inlet velocity, the inlet diameter and the kinematic viscosity of the combustion products is Re ≈ 620 and the expansion ratio, which is the ratio of the unburned to the burned ﬂuid density, is e ≈ 6.07. For transient simulations, a veloc- ity forcing with an amplitude ˆu 1 of 0.002 u 1 is imposed at the inlet. The characteristic time of restoration is estimated to τr = 19.041 ms and τr = 12.008 ms for the Cr = 0.04 and the Cr = 0.066 conﬁguration, respectively. For more details it is again referred to Appendix. A. 4.02 Irrotational and V ortical Response Analysis The low-order modeling approach proposed in this chapter assumes — in accordance with other approaches, such as the ones proposed by Fleiﬁlet al or Schuller et al — a steady mean ﬂow on which a transient velocity perturbation is super- posed. The spatio-temporal structure of the latter is computed employing the model- ing approach introduced in Chap. 3 neglecting ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. An overview of this approach is provided in Fig. 3.09. The ﬂame dynamics are captured by a linearized 1 D G-equation based model that is perturbed by an acoustically compact ﬂow follow- ing Eq. (3.012). In order to avoid occurrence of a ﬂow ﬁeld singularity in the vicinity Primary Interactions of the ﬂame anchoring point and for the sake of capturing the effect of vortex shed- ding, a Kutta condition is applied. The mean ﬂow is characterized by a constant axial velocity ublk and a constant ﬂame speed s L, which in combination lead to the forma- tion of an inclined steady state ﬂame front. The position of the mean ﬂow shear layer is taken from the high-ﬁdelity CFD simulations described in Sec. 4.01. The transport velocity for vorticity along this line is set to the ﬁxed value of ublk /2. The spatial shape of the velocity perturbation associated with the regime of compact acoustics depends on the conﬁnement ratio Cr. This can be seen from the deﬁnition of the resulting velocity ﬁeld provided in Eq. (3.018) and the herein occurring mapping provided by Eq. (3.017). Hence, in this section, the responses of two ﬂame conﬁgu- rations of different conﬁnement ratios are analyzed and the results are compared to CFD/SI data, see Appendix. A. For this purpose, the two test cases introduced in Sec. 4.01 are simulated. In a ﬁrst step, simulations under harmonic velocity forcing are conducted and analyzed in Sec. 4.02.01. Realizing that vortex shedding is negligible, the impulse response is com- puted in Sec. 4.02.02 relying solely on the irrotational velocity component. This re- quires some non-trivial considerations caused by the Kutta condition. In a ﬁnal step, in Sec. 4.02.03, analyzes the gathered response data and compares it to CFD/SI results. 4.02.01 Harmonic Forcing Harmonic forcing of the bulk ﬂow velocity provokes irrotational ﬂow ﬁeld perturba- tions and, at edge A, the shedding of vorticity. A Kutta panel attached to this edge ensures that the ﬂow ﬁeld remains ﬁnite and leaves the trailing edge tangentially to the wall contour. In each time step, the vorticity bound by this panel is condensed into a point vortex that is placed right at the panel end. This vortex then becomes part of the vortical ﬂow ﬁeld and is advected along the mean ﬂow shear layer by a velocity ublk /2, whose coordinates are estimated from the CFD data, see Fig. 4.01 ( ). Forcing the Cr = 0.04 conﬁguration harmonically at a frequency of 80 Hz and an am- plitude of 2% ublk results in a response as depicted in Fig. 4.02. Here, four snapshots at different phases of the forcing signal are shown. The upper half of each snapshot visualizes the resulting vortical and the lower half the corresponding irrotational per- turbation velocity ﬁeld. The ﬂame front displacements provoked by the latter ( ) are signiﬁcantly larger than the vortical ones. Hence, it seems that shed vorticity hardly contributes to the response of the ﬂame and could safely be neglected. The spatial shape of the irrotational perturbation can be deduced from the green arrows shown in Fig. 4.02, which illustrate the ﬂame normal velocity perturbations. Accord- ing to them, acoustic perturbations mainly displace the ﬂame base region, while the ﬂame tip is hardly affected. In the literature, a common approach to approximate the amount of vorticity shed 4.02 Irrotational and V ortical Response Analysis Figure 4.02: LOM predictions of a harmonically forced ﬂame conﬁguration (at 80 Hz and an amplitude of 2% ublk ) for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.04. Shown are four consecutive snapshots taken at phases from 0◦ to 270◦ with re- spect of the forcing signal. The upper half of each snapshot shows the vortical ﬂow component, where the color along the shear layer corre- sponds to the strength of the vorticity ﬂuctuations. The lower half shows the respective irrotational ﬂow component. The ﬂame normal velocity, scaled by a factor of 4, is illustrated by green arrows (upper+lower half). The shown ﬂame front displacements are scaled by a factor of 7 ( ). during a time interval ∆t is to evaluate the linearized relation ∆Γ′(t ) = ublk ∫ t +∆t t u′ 1 ( ˆt ) d ˆt, (4.01) which provides an estimate of the created total circulation of the separating vortex sheet. This formula has been used by Steinbacheret al in order to quantify the effects of the free shear layer onto the ﬂame front. Fig. 4.03 compares the resulting strength of the vortex sheet of this approach ( ) to the one caused by the aforementioned Kutta condition ( ). For Cr = 0.04, the amplitude of vorticity ﬂuctuations caused by the Kutta condition is more than twice as large as the one computed by Eq. (4.01). Nevertheless, both studies — the one of Steinbacheret al and the one presented here — agree that vortex shedding has only a negligible impact on the ﬂame response. Having a look at the Cr = 0.066 conﬁguration, both ways of computing the shed vorticity almost coincide. Therefore, it seems that predictions of Eq. (4.01) agree better with results of the Kutta condition in cases where the ﬂow is less two-dimensional, which is the case if the conﬁnement is getting more narrow (Cr → 1). 4.02.02 Impulse Forcing The ﬁnding that vorticity shed from the burner mouth has only a negligible impact on the ﬂame response shall now be exploited: It allows to evaluate the impulse re- sponse (IR) solely based on the irrotational part of the perturbation velocity ﬁeld.

(4.01) ( ) for three forcing cycles at 80 Hz and two conﬁnement ratios. T o this end, an impulsive forcing u′ blk = ǫδ(t ) of amplitude ǫ is applied to the com- bustor and the resulting instantaneous ﬂame displacement is computed from the respective irrotational velocity perturbation by evaluation of the temporal integral ξ(x∥) = ∫ ∞ 0 u′ ⊥(x∥)dt. Application of a Kutta panel, however, leads to a situations where u′ ⊥(x∥) depends on the panel length, which is computed from the local trans- port velocity ( ˜u+ + ˜u−)/2 multiplied by the temporal width of the impulse forcing ∆t. Assuming a harmonic forcing signal, vorticity is continuously shed from the burner mouth. That means, the panel length Hx is well deﬁned in each time step and con- tinuously varies over time. In the case of an impulsive signal, however, the resulting panel length Hx depends on both the amplitude of the forcing and the width of the impulse signal. This is a problem since in the linear limit, the impulse response maps to a certain frequency response and vice versa. Having a signiﬁcant dependency of the response to the forcing amplitudeǫ, this property is no longer ensured as will be shown in the following. Fig. 4.04 analyzes for two conﬁnement ratios how the ﬂame normal velocity perturba- tion depends on the length of the vortex panel. For this purpose, an impulsive velocity forcing is applied and the resulting ﬂame normal velocity is measured for different panel lengths right at the moment when the impulse hits the ﬂame. A rather strong impact of the panel length on the resulting velocity can be observed: the shorter the panel gets, the higher and more localized the peak velocity becomes. Thus, an impul- sive forcing using a very narrow impulse perturbation or a very low amplitude would both lead to a short Kutta panel and, therefore, to a ﬂame displacement that is very localized at the ﬂame holder. The opposite holds for a wide impulse perturbation or a high velocity amplitude. In consequence, this means that the IR is rather sensitive to the speciﬁc kind of forcing signal, which is an unfavorable property. In order to compute an estimate of the IR that robustly captures the linear dynamics of the system in the inviscid limit, an empirical approach is chosen: the panel length 4.02 Irrotational and V ortical Response Analysis 0 0. 1 0. 2 0. 30 x F 1/L f [-] u′⊥/ ˆu [-] Cr = 0. 4 0 2 4 60 x 1 [mm] x 2 [mm] 0 0. 1 0. 2 0. 3 x F 1/L f [-] Cr = 0. 66 0 2 4 6 x 1 [mm] Figure 4.04: T op: Flame normal velocity resulting from a constant mean ﬂow and a Kutta condition evaluated for four panel lengths,Hξ ( ), Hξ/2 ( ), Hξ/4 ( ) and Hξ/8 ( ) plotted over normalized ﬂame coordinate.

Lower: V isualization of the associated panel shapes, where the end of each panel is marked by a vertical line. Additionally, the ﬂame front is shown ( ). is set to a value such that the frequency response computed from the resulting IR cor- responds best to predictions using harmonic forcing. The associated panels fulﬁlling this requirement best are plotted in Fig. 4.04 for the two investigated conﬁnement ra- tios ( ). Panels of these lengths have already been studied in Sec. 3.03.03. Using the associated ﬂame normal velocity perturbations resulting from such panel lengths, the ﬂame displacement right at the moment when the impulse hits the ﬂame (t ∗ = 0) is computed and plotted in Fig. 4.05. The shown curves are normalized by the displace- ment amplitudeˆξ = ∫ t 0 u′ 1 d t. Indeed, good agreement between the LOM ( ) and the CFD/SI data ( ) is found for t ∗ = 0 for both conﬁnement ratios. Details on the processing of the CFD results are provided in Appendix. A.4. Due to the fact that the resulting ﬂame front has the shape of a triangle att ∗ = 0, a so-called ﬂame base displacement (FBD) model is introduced: ξ(x∥, t ) = 2 sin(α)ǫ fb [ Θ ( x∥ − t u∥ ) − θ ( x∥ − t u∥ − fb L f )] [ 1 − x∥ − t u∥ L f fb ] (4.02) where fb measures the length of the triangle relative to the ﬂame length L f and u∥ the ﬂame-parallel component of the mean ﬂow velocity ublk. The height of the triangle results from conservation of the global volume ﬂux of the perturbation.

This ﬁxes the height of the triangle to 2 sin(α)ǫ/ fb. For both conﬁnement ratios, a value of fb = 0.06 matches the CFD/SI and LOM data best. This model intro- duces a simple analytical approximation of the ﬂame response for the limiting case of neglected ﬂame-ﬂow feedback employing one empirical parameterfb. 4.02.03 Discussion If we compare the results of all three ﬂame response models illustrated in Fig. 4.05 for t ∗ > 0, we notice that the initial ﬂame front displacements are advected towards the ﬂame tip. While the speciﬁc shapes of the acoustic LOM and the FBD model remain unchanged during this process, the CFD/SI data exhibits a spatial growth of the initial displacement amplitude. Furthermore, a secondary negative and a tertiary positive displacement develop. This behavior has most likely to be attributed to ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, which is neglected by the acoustic LOM. The observed growth in ampli- tude is reminiscent of the Darrieus-Landau mechanism known from planar ﬂames that propagate perpendicular to the unburned ﬂow. In contrast to these setups, the inclined ﬂame geometries investigated here exhibit a characteristic, triangle shaped initial perturbation of signiﬁcant amplitude as well as (ﬁxed) boundaries. Therefore, the situation at hand is similar, but still different (in terms of initial and boundary conditions) to the one known from classical studies on the Darrieus-Landau insta- bility. It has to be checked carefully how these classical results can be applied for 4.02 Irrotational and V ortical Response Analysis Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase 0 0. 5 1 1. 5 2 − 6 − 3 t∗ [-] h∗ (a) Cr = 0.04 0. 5 1. 5 Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -6π f∗ [-] Phase 0 0. 5 1 1. 5 2 − 2 − 1 t∗ [-] h∗ (b) Cr = 0.066 Figure 4.06: IR and FR in terms of gain and phase for Cr = 0.04 (left) and Cr = 0.066 (right).

Additionally, results from harmonic forcing of the acoustic LOM are included, split into irrotational ( ) and a vortical ( ) contributions. Bunsen-type ﬂames, which will be analyzed in more detail in Chap. 5. Comparing the transient behavior of the Cr = 0.04 to the Cr = 0.066 setup, a weaker growth of the initially caused ﬂame displacements can be observed for the latter. It seems that the presence of a conﬁnement delimits the possible displacement am- plitudes. Based on the analysis presented in this chapter, which neglects ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, the detailed mechanisms responsible for this behavior cannot be analyzed, though. In Fig. 4.05 it can be seen that the resulting non-dimensional initial displace- ments as well as the velocity of convection match the CFD data very well. Based on the results shown in Fig. 4.06, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback is supposed to have a ma- jor impact onto the response of the global heat release rate. One of the most prominent discrepancies constitutes the damped oscillatory behavior of the IR predicted by the CFD/SI data ( ), especially for the wide conﬁnement case ( Cr = 0.04). Here, the acoustic LOM only captures the ﬁrst peak of this curve, signiﬁcantly underestimat- ing the amplitude. The subsequent positive and negative peaks are not captured at all. In the frequency domain, the damped oscillatory behavior manifests itself as a very high peak gain value at a Strouhal number approximately corresponding to the oscillation frequency. The acoustic LOM, on the other hand, results in a frequency response resembling the gain behavior of a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter. The almost lin- early decaying phase is captured well by all models. Primary Interactions The agreement between the acoustic LOM and the CFD/SI data is better for the nar- row conﬁnement conﬁguration (Cr = 0.066). Here, the ﬁrst peak of the IR is captured reasonably well. In contrast to the Cr = 0.04 case, the IR exhibits a relatively high level around t ∗ = 0, which cannot be observed in the CFD/SI data. Hence, the initial dis- placement at the ﬂame tip is overpredicted, which is also seen in Fig. 4.05. The IR of the Cr = 0.066 setup shows less pronounced peaks and, thus, the associated FR shows a reduced peak gain value compared to the Cr = 0.04 case. Fig. 4.06 decomposes the frequency response of the acoustic LOM into its irrotational ( ) and vortical ( ) contributions. The individual frequency response data is gained from harmonic simulations, as depicted in Fig. 4.02. The fact that the former matches the results gained from the impulsively forced conﬁguration ( ), very well cross- validates both approaches. The weak response of the vortical contribution conﬁrms the ﬁnding that vortex shedding can be safely neglected. Finally, an analytical prediction of the response of the FBD model introduced in Eq. (4.02) is provided. Its impulse response writes h∗ FBD (t ) = t ∗ − 1 + fb 2 f 2 b [ Θ(t ∗ − 1 + fb ) − Θ(t ∗ − 1) ] (4.03) with the Heaviside Theta function Θ(t ). The associated FR can be mapped to fre- quency domain by use of T ab. C.2. Following Fig. 4.06, this model captures the over- all trend of the acoustic LOM model well. Due to the fact that ﬂame-ﬂow feedback has such an important inﬂuence onto the ﬂame response, it can only be used to esti- mate the cut-off frequency or the phase behavior, but not the gain around a Strouhal number of approximately unity. In this regard it is much simpler to evaluate than the presented acoustic LOM, while it still captures the essential effects. 4.03 Summary and Conclusions The response of laminar premixed ﬂames stabilized at a backward-facing step to ve- locity perturbations was scrutinized. One goal was to test the hypothesis that shed vorticity contributes to the so-called convective velocity perturbations, which are an important, widely-used element of low-order ﬂame response models. Analytical methods from aero-acoustics were combined with a ﬂow decomposition approach to quantify the respective contributions of the irrotational and the vortical parts of the disturbance velocity ﬁeld to the overall ﬂame transfer function (FTF). The complete set of equations derived in Chap. 3 capturing the ﬂow ﬁeld dynamics of acoustically perturbed ﬂames was used, however, exothermic effects, in particular the effect of ﬂame displacement and wrinkling on the upstream velocity, were neglected in this study. For the cases considered — a Slit ﬂame geometry with a Péclet number of Pe= 223, an expansion ratio of e ≈ 6.07 and conﬁnement ratios Cr = 0.04 and 0.066 — the ir- 4.03 Summary and Conclusions rotational part was shown to dominate the ﬂame displacement, which is most pro- nounced at and near the ﬂame anchoring point. Correspondingly, a ﬂame base dis- placement (FBD) model was proposed, which captures the early part of the impulse response well, particularly for high conﬁnement ratios. Discrepancies for later times and for low conﬁnement ratios were attributed to exothermic ﬂame-ﬂow-ﬂame feed- back mechanisms not taken into account by the low-order modeling approach. For the conﬁgurations investigated, vortex shedding is found to only have a negligible impact on the ﬂame response. The main ﬁndings of the present analysis are: 1. V ortex shedding due to an oscillatory ﬂow in the vicinity of a sharp corner is found to have only negligible impact on the ﬂame response. 2. Hence, the shedding of vorticity was ruled out as a possible candidate to phys- ically justify the assumption of convected velocity perturbations as a source of ﬂame wrinkling. Consequently, one must conclude that models based on this assumption do not faithfully represent acoustics-ﬂame-ﬂow interactions. 3. The irrotational part of an acoustic perturbation essentially interacts with the ﬂame base region, which is captured by an analytical model proposed in this study, namely, the FBD model. Flame-ﬂow feedback is supposed to have a substantial impact on the ﬂame response, particularly, at Strouhal numbers of order O (1). It might lead to rather high and dis- tinct peaks in the gain of an FTF, particularly, for high conﬁnement ratios. This will be analyzed in more detail in the next chapter. Primary Interactions 5 Secondary Interactions The previously introduced low-order modeling framework is ex- tended such that it can cope with two important types of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback: (i) vortical ﬂame-ﬂow feedback resulting from ﬂame gen- erated vorticity and (ii) irrotational ﬂame-ﬂow feedback resulting from a ﬂame normal acceleration of the ﬂow across a ﬂame sheet. Both contribute to the convective growth of ﬂame sheet disturbances and account for the appearance of FTF gain values exceeding unity as well as convected velocity perturbations upstream a perturbed ﬂame. In the previous chapter, interactions of acoustic perturbations and burner-stabilized Slit ﬂames were analyzed in the limit of negligible ﬂame-ﬂow feedback (no gas ex- pansion) and ﬂame stretch (constant ﬂame speed). While the latter is expected to dampen ﬂame front displacements (Le> Lec,TD ), ﬂame-ﬂow feedback leads to con- vective growth of ﬂame perturbations ( e > 1). Consequently, the observed signiﬁcant discrepancy between the low-order model developed in the previous chapter and high ﬁdelity CFD data was attributed to ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. This hypothesis shall be an- alyzed in more detail in the following. In order to clarify the discussion, we want to agree upon the terminology ﬁrst. The term“secondary interactions” has already been speciﬁed before and refers to phe- nomena/ﬂame displacements, which are not directly caused by acoustic perturba- tions, but by incompressible ﬂame intrinsic processes. It can be distinguished most easily between primary and secondary interactions for the case of impulsively forced ﬂames, since any change in ﬂame shape occurring after an acoustic impulse has hit the ﬂame (t > 0) is subsumed as a secondary interaction (except advection). In prin- ciple, all phenomena discussed in Chap. 1 governing the dynamics of a ﬂame sheet are potentially important here. It was observed in the previous chapter by inspecting high ﬁdelity CFD data that the primary displacement, caused by acoustics, grows in amplitude and, additionally, secondary displacements develop. Such a growth is the signature of a hydrodynamic mechanism, described in Sec. 1.02.03, which is sometimes also referred to as the Darrieus-Landau mechanism. It arises due to interactions of the ﬂow ﬁeld with the ﬂame sheet, captured by a set of jump conditions. It is driven by the change in speciﬁc volume across the ﬂame, i. e. it is a consequence of gas expansion. Hence, this phenomenon relies onﬂame-ﬂow feedback. Secondary Interactions The role of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback for the (linear) response has already been pointed out by some previous studies. Already Baillotet al attributed the occurrence of convected ﬂow perturbations upstream a wrinkled ﬂame front to the “retroactive hydrodynamic effects of the ﬂame on the ﬂow of the unburned gases” (Baillot et al, p. 164). This was later conﬁrmed by Birbaud et al, who conducted a series of demonstrative experiments. Blanchard et al numerically showed that a perturbed ﬂame sheet acts as a vortex sheet whose upstream inﬂuence contributes to the formation of axially convected velocity perturbations. They related this phe- nomenon to the Darrieus-Landau mechanisms. The relevance of this hydrodynamic mechanism for the ﬂame response of perturbed burner-stabilized ﬂames was further conﬁrmed by the studies of Hemchandra and Schlimpertet al. Both re- ported a strong impact of hydrodynamic mechanisms leading to the spatial growth of ﬂame front perturbations. Hemchandra conjectured that this mechanism may be responsible for the occurrence of high FTF gains exceeding unity. Flow instabilities often trigger the development of large coherent structures. In conse- quence, characteristic ﬂow features develop, which have important consequences for technical applications. Oberleithneret al as well as Oberleithner and Paschereit found for swirl-stabilized ﬂames that the gain of the ﬂame response scales with stability properties of the respective shear layers. According to these studies, a Kelvin–Helmholtz-type hydrodynamic instability triggered by acoustic perturbations leads to the formation of large scale coherent structures that interact with the ﬂame and, thus, provoke ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate. Similar to ﬂames, shear layers (or vortex sheets) can be idealized as discontinuities. While ﬂame related dis- continuities exhibit jumps in normal and tangential velocity, shear layers only show changes in tangential velocity. In their most idealized versions, both entities are un- conditionally (convectively) unstable and may hence both contribute to the formation of coherent structures that may impact the ﬂame response. Hence, the Darrieus-Landau mechanisms or instability should be analyzed in more detail and clearly demarcated from shear layer instabilities. As a ﬁrst step, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback related mechanism will be analyzed for laminar ﬂames in this chapter. Although thermal-diffusive mechanisms might have a crucial impact on secondary acoustics-ﬂame interactions, as well, the following discussion focuses on the hy- drodynamic ones. They are the drivers for all observable secondary phenomena, while thermal-diffusive mechanisms only exert a damping inﬂuence (assuming lean methane-air ﬂames). It can already be anticipated that a consideration of driving mechanisms will create a need for damping and, therefore, displacement amplitudes are likely to be overestimated if damping mechanisms are neglected. It will be shown in the course of this chapter that this expectation is true indeed, however, this point is beyond the scope of this work and shall be left for succeeding studies. This chapter strives to take one step forward towards a comprehensive understanding of the ﬂame dynamics by assessing mechanisms that provoke the convective growth of ﬂame front perturbations. These mechanisms are expected to be associated with ﬂame-ﬂow feed- back. 5.01 Flame Response Revisited in the Light of Flame-Flow Feedback In a ﬁrst step, Sec. 5.01 revisits ﬂame response predictions from high ﬁdelity CFD simulations as well as from low-order models relying on convected velocity pertur- bations in the light of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. Section 5.02 then shows how ﬂame-ﬂow feedback is integrated into the modeling framework introduced in Chap. 3. Finally, Sec. 5.03 discusses and analyzes ﬂame response predictions computed with this new framework and compares them to high ﬁdelity CFD simulations. 5.01 Flame Response Revisited in the Light of Flame-Flow Feedback As already discussed in Chap. 2, the understanding and modeling of interactions be- tween acoustics and burner stabilized ﬂames often relies on the notion of convected velocity perturbations. Conversely, in the case of ﬂames whose anchoring is mechan- ically displaced, it essentially follows the concepts of ﬂame-sheet dynamics outlined in Chap. 1. Based on this point of view, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback — namely the hydro- dynamic mechanism explicated in Sec. 1.02.03 — is not explicitly considered in the analysis of acoustically perturbed ﬂames. Nevertheless, it is implicitly contained in the models since, according to the literature, the observed convected perturbations are supposed to be induced by the upstream inﬂuence of a wrinkled ﬂame. In the following, the response of acoustically perturbed ﬂames is revisited fo- cusing on consequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. The goal is to provide links between the notion of convected velocity perturbations and the dynamics of ﬂames driven by gas expansion. T o this end, high ﬁdelity CFD data is evaluated in Sec. 5.01.01. Special focus is put on how the impulse response is linked to the ﬂame sheet dynamics and how strong the expected effects of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback are. This provides further evidence for the conjecture made in Chap. 4, which states that the oscillatory nature of the IR and the high gain values are caused by gas expansion driven ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. Subsequently, the convective velocity model is revisited in Sec. 5.01.02 and analyzed in the light of these ﬁndings. 5.01.01 High Fidelity CFD/SI Data The snapshots shown in Fig. 4.05 ( ), which are taken from high ﬁdelity CFD data, clearly indicate convectively growing ﬂame displacements amplitudes. Furthermore, three distinct positive and negative peaks emerge in the ﬁnal snapshot, although — following the analysis of Chap. 4 — acoustics caused only one of them directly (the one att ∗ = 0). Consequently, the other peaks have to be caused by ﬂame sheet in- trinsic mechanisms. Flame-ﬂow feedback due to exothermic gas expansion is one promising candidate for such a mechanism, since it was explicitly neglected in the low-order modeling approach analyzed in the previous chapter, see Fig. 4.05 ( ). Secondary Interactions Figure 5.01: T op: Impulse responses for the Cr = 0.04 ( ) conﬁguration depicted in Fig. 4.01 (but with TBP = 700 K). Instants in time corresponding to one of the snapshots shown in the bottom blot are marked by vertical lines. Bottom : Consecutive snapshots of the normalized ﬂame-normal ﬂame front displacement caused by an impulsive acoustic forcing of a ﬂame setup with Cr = 0.04 ( ). Depicted are ﬁve instants in time, where t 1 matches the time the acoustic impulse hits the ﬂame. Primary and secondary peaks in ﬂame shape are marked by colored dots. It is shown in Appendix. A.3 that the global heat release signal of a ﬂame subjected to an impulsive forcing (Fig. 4.05; ) coincides well with the IR identiﬁed from broad band data for all analyzed setups (Fig. 4.06; ). Consequently, the analysis of the ﬂow ﬁeld and ﬂame dynamics resulting from an impulsive forcing provides valuable physical insights into the linear ﬂame dynamics. In order to relate the ﬂame displacement data with the respective IR, it is necessary to know how the global heat release rate is linked to ﬂame sheet displacements. As will be detailed in Chap. 6, in the limit of stifﬂy anchored Slit ﬂames, the linear dynamics of the global heat release rate depends only on the displacement of the ﬂame tip. That means, the heat release rate stays constant as long as the ﬂame tip is not perturbed. Exploiting this relation, Fig. 5.01 compares the IR of the Slit ﬂame conﬁguration to the associated ﬂame front displacements 1. At the very moment the acoustic impulse hits the ﬂame ( t = 0), the ﬂame front is displaced in the previously described triangle- like manner and a primary displacement peak is formed. At this time, the IR of the global heat release rateh∗ shows no signal since the ﬂame tip was not displaced. 1 The data shown corresponds to the same setup as discussed in Chap. 4, only the temperature of the anchoring wall is changed to TBP = 700 K. As discussed in App. B, this hardly affects the overall characteristics of the ﬂame response, which allows to directly compare both setups. 5.01 Flame Response Revisited in the Light of Flame-Flow Feedback 0 0. 25 0. 5 0. 75 1 -4 σ ≈ − 1. 22 1 s x F 1/L f ξ/ ˆξ Cr = 0. 66 0 0. 25 0. 5 0. 75 1 σ ≈ 86. 9 1 s x F 1/L f Cr = 0. 40 0 0. 25 0. 5 0. 75 1 σ ≈ 122 1 s x F 1/L f Cr = 0. 17 Figure 5.02: Normalized ﬂame displacements shown for three conﬁnement ratios cor- responding to the cases shown in Fig. 5.01. Additionally, a case with Cr = 0.017 is added. The thick black line signiﬁes the displacement im- mediately caused by an impulsive velocity forcing of the ﬂame and the gray lines its subsequent spatio-temporal development. The primary pos- itive displacement peak is tracked and marked in each time step ( ). Similarly, the positive and negative secondary peaks are tracked ( ). An exponential function is ﬁtted to the spatial trace of the primary peak ( ) and from it a temporal growth rate σ is computed. Only around t 3 (Cr = 0.04; ) the heat release rate starts to increases, which corre- sponds to the time the initially created primary displacement reaches x F 1 /L f = 1. Ac- cordingly, the subsequent negative secondary displacements causes the heat release to decrease to negative values att 4. W e note that (i) the convective growth of ﬂame front displacements directly leads to higher peak values of the associated IR and (ii) the presence of the numerous positive and negative displacement peaks of decreasing amplitude is responsible for the damped oscillatory IR behavior. Those two observa- tions are supposed to be caused by ﬂame-ﬂow feedback and shall be quantiﬁed in the following. T o this end, the spatial growth of the convected displacement peaks is evaluated. Fig. 5.02 combines several snapshots of the displaced ﬂame front at different instants in time in one single plot (thick black line fort ∗ = 0 and gray lines for t ∗ > 0). Ad- ditionally, for each snapshot, the maximum of the primary displacement — caused by acoustics att ∗ = 0 — is marked by a green circle ( ). The subsequently devel- oping ﬁrst two positive and negative secondary peaks are marked by orange circles ( ). Due to the fact that all of these maxima are convected downstream towards the ﬂame tip at x F 1 /L f = 1, their traces form lines of growing amplitude. Assuming this growth is governed by linear dynamics (no sharp edges in concave regions!) and the initial shape approximately resembles a sine (see particularly the shapes att ≥ t 2 in Fig. 5.01), the growth should be exponential. Fitting an exponential function to the distribution of the primary peaks, a spatial growth rateσx is computed. In order to avoid to capture anchoring and tip related effects, points close to one of these two exceptional points are excluded from the respective data sets. By use of the advection Secondary Interactions velocity u∥, these spatial growth rates can be converted to temporal ones via σ = σx u∥. Before the results of this kind of analysis are discussed, it should be emphasized that impulsively forced data is used here. Such kind of analysis, however, is usually per- formed based on harmonically forced data, see for example Truffaut and Searby. Assuming that harmonic forcing also results in harmonic ﬂame sheet perturbations of a single wave number, growth rates can be evaluated for each wave number sep- arately. Repeating this for several frequencies, samples of the underlying dispersion relation are computed. Imposing an impulsive acoustic forcing excites perturbations of several wave numbers at the same time, see the triangle-shaped initial displace- ment shown in Fig. 5.01. Subsequently, each excited wave number perturbation will independently grow in amplitude at a rate given by the underlying dispersion relation (we assume we are still in the linear regime). This means that the ﬂame displace- ments shown in Fig. 5.01 are a superposition of all of these individual perturbations. Therefore, the computed overall growth rate can not directly be related to frequency- speciﬁc growth rates of the associated dispersion relation. Nevertheless, the displace- ments resembles a sine-like shape already in the second snapshot (t 2 ). Therefore, it is possible to get, at least, a rough idea of the order of magnitude of the maximally expected growth rates from impulsively forced data. In the scope of this section, this shall be sufﬁcient. Evaluating the temporal growth ratesσ for three conﬁnement ratios in Fig. 5.01, it is found that they strongly depend on conﬁnement ratio. While the growth of displace- ments is suppressed at the narrowest conﬁnement, it reaches a value of about 120 1/s for Cr = 0.017. In order to put this number into perspective, it is non-dimensionalized by the ﬂame transition time τt = δD /s L to στt = 0.0038. Truffaut and Searby ex- perimentally determined non-dimensional growth rates between approximately 0.003 and 0.009 for rich propane-air ﬂames stabilized at a harmonically displaced rod, see Fig. 1.04. The order of magnitude of their results is hence the same as the ones ob- tained here. Further, Truffaut and Searby attributed the observed growth to the Darrieus-Landau mechanism, which is denoted as the hydrodynamic mechanism in Chap. 1. This provides evidence that similar, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback related processes are at work for the conﬁgurations studied in this thesis. For future studies it should be kept in mind that displacement amplitude growth rates may signiﬁcantly be inﬂu- enced by lateral constraints of the ﬂow, such as a conﬁnement. 5.01.02 Convective V elocity Model If ﬂame-ﬂow feedback really has the decisive impact on the ﬂame dynamics as as- serted above, why is it possible that G-equation based approaches relying on convec- tive velocity models, which do not explicitly account for ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, are capable of correctly reproducing essential aspects of the dynamics of acoustically perturbed ﬂames? The answer is that they implicitly do, which is analyzed in the 5.01 Flame Response Revisited in the Light of Flame-Flow Feedback Figure 5.03: Normalized ﬂame front displacements as predicted by the uniform (top) and the incompressible convective (middle and bottom) velocity model for a harmonic velocity forcing at a Strouhal number ofω∗ = 5 (top and middle) and one of ω∗ = 20 (bottom). following. Having a closer look at the convective velocity model of Eq. (2.05), one recognizes that this model indeed leads to a spatial growth of ﬂame front displacements. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.03, which shows the response of a ﬂame front exposed to harmonic velocity forcing at a ﬁxed frequency according to the 1 D linearized G-equation ap- proach introduced in Sec. 1.03.02. Three response predictions are shown for two veloc- ity models and two Strouhal numbers. While, for a Strouhal number of 5, the uniform velocity model of Eq. (2.04) (Fig. 5.03, top) shows a constant amplitude of the wrin- kled ﬂame surface, the incompressible convective velocity model (Fig. 5.03, middle) exhibits a clear spatial growth of the respective ﬂame front displacements. Hence, the convected velocity perturbation mimics the effects of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, which explains their agreement with experimental data. At a Strouhal number of 20, however, the spatial distribution of displacement am- plitudes grows only up to x F 1 /L f ≳ 0.05 and subsequently decreases again. Overall, a low frequency modulation on top of a high frequency oscillation becomes visible (Fig. 5.03, bottom), which is also known as a beat. This might explain the decreas- ing predictive capabilities of such models at high frequencies, which was reported by Cuquelet al. But even at sufﬁciently low frequencies, the model deviates from a realistic behavior. Theoretically, it is possible to evaluate spatial growth rates relying on a convective velocity model by post-processing displacement predictions as the one shown in Fig. 5.03, middle. Doing this for several forcing frequencies, this will eventually result in a dispersion relation that, ideally, coincides at low frequen- cies with the realistic ﬂame sheet behavior. If that is true, we can expect that the con- vective velocity predicts the actual acoustic ﬂame response very well. The study of Kashinathet al, however, suggests that convective velocity models do not cap- ture the real physical behavior. In this work, the authors ﬁtted the convection speed of the velocity perturbations to high ﬁdelity CFD data and found a signiﬁcant de- pendency of this speed to frequency. Knowing that this speed inﬂuences the resulting growth rates, their study indicates that the dispersion relation naturally resulting from Secondary Interactions a convective model does not agree with the one of the underlying physical process, but requires a non straight forward ﬁtting procedure. It can be concluded that models relying on convected velocity perturbation mimic the ﬂame-ﬂow feedback related spatial growth of displacement amplitudes, however, only up to a certain frequency. Furthermore, the associated (theoretical) dispersion relation of these kind of models does in general not reproduce the real physical be- havior. 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback The previous section pointed out the importance of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback by analyzing high ﬁdelity CFD data. Furthermore, hints of such a feedback were found in the convective velocity model, which is commonly applied in G-equation based modeling approaches. Motivated by these ﬁndings, the goal of this section is to integrate ﬂame- ﬂow feedback into the modeling framework introduced in Chap. 3 such that it can be used to analyze its impact on the linear ﬂame response. According to the concepts outlined in Chap. 1, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback is a hydrody- namic mechanism related to density changes across the ﬂame sheet. It necessarily results in the unconditional growth of ﬂame front displacements, if it is not stabilized by thermal-diffusive mechanisms. Following the analysis of Darrieus and Lan- dau, in the framework of gasdynamic discontinuities, this growth emerges from the jump conditions of mass and momentum across the ﬂame. Hence, it can be expected that analyzing these conditions in more detail contributes to the understanding of the basic mechanisms at play. Having done this, it should be possible to integrate gas expansion into the existing modeling framework of Chap. 3. It explicitly appears at two positions, (i) as volume source in the gas expansion related ﬂow componentue of Eq. (3.013) and (ii) in form of a density gradient in the baroclinic source term of the vorticity transport equation, i. e. Eq. (3.09). The modeling concept proposed in this section concerning point (i) relies on the speciﬁcation of a volume production kernel. This kernel function distributes the volume produced by the ﬂame in space and serves as a source to the gas expansion related ﬂow ﬁeld componentue. Based on a study conducted by Zimmermann, a Gaussian kernel function will be introduced. Concerning the modeling concept for the baroclinic source term, see point (ii), it will be shown that a candidate for such a concept can be derived from the analysis of the jump conditions. Following these ideas, Sec. 5.02.01 derives and analyzes a set of jump conditions, including and excluding ﬂame stretch effects, respectively. Based on these results, Sec. 5.02.02 introduces a concept for how ﬂame generated (baroclinic) vorticity can be included into the modeling framework. Finally, a kinematic modeling approach of gas expansion is introduced in Sec. 5.02.03. 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback 5.02.01 Jump Conditions Across a Flame Sheet In the subsequent analysis it is assumed that the ﬂuxes of mass and momentum through the ﬂame front are constant, i. e. the ﬂuxes of mass, normal and tangential momentum are conserved across the ﬂame sheet [m]b u= 0, [ p + m ui ni ]b u= 0, [ m ui ti ]b u= 0, (5.01) where ui, ni and ti denote the i -th component of the ﬂow velocity, the local ﬂame normal and ﬂame tangential vectors, respectively. Further, the Einstein summation convention is employed andm = ui ni − ∂ξ∂t denotes the local mass ﬂux across the ﬂame sheet. This essentially follows the original ideas of Landau and Markstein, who derived the set of jump conditions shown in Eq. (1.07). All of the relations shown below are derived from the formulation of the ﬂuxes as they are stated in Eq. (5.01). They are evaluated right at the mean ﬂame position, which is, per deﬁnition, ﬁxed in space and time. This simpliﬁcation imposes an error that scales with the displacement amplitude and the inverse of the perturbations wave length. A ﬂame aligned coordinate system[x 1, x 2 ] as depicted in Fig. 1.09 b is assumed. The mean ﬂow ﬁeld in which a freely propagating ﬂame sheet is stabilized points towards the positivex 2 -direction. Application of the jump conditions Eq. (5.01) requires the computation of the velocity components tangential and normal to the ﬂame front. The linear analysis presented in the following shall be limited to perturbation wave lengthsλ that are long compared to the convective-diffusive length scale δD in order to avoid the occurrence of signiﬁcant levels of ﬂame stretch and to not trigger sig- niﬁcant 2 D effects. Mathematically, this fact is reﬂected by limiting the analysis to large Péclet numbers Pe= δD /λ. Furthermore, ﬂame displacement amplitudes shall be small, that is ξ ≪ λ. W e assume ξ = O (ǫ), where ǫ may be a small quantity, such that all terms O ( ǫ2 ) are negligible. Accordingly, they are dropped in the following analysis. Developing all quantities in powers of Pe −1 shifts perturbations that exhibit a short wave length compared to the ﬂame thickness to higher order terms in the ex- pansion parameter. Based on this expansion, only zeroth order terms are considered in the following. Using this method, the ﬂame normal and tangential vectors resulting from the perturbed ﬂame are given by nf = [ n f,1, n f,2 ] = [ − ∂ξ ∂x 1, 1 ] +O ( Pe−1 ) and t f = [ t f,1, t f,2 ] = [ 1, ∂ξ ∂x 1 ] +O ( Pe−1 ), (5.02) respectively. A perturbed ﬂame sheet goes along with perturbations of all other ﬂow vari- ables, that is velocity and pressure. Assuming a ﬂow ﬁeld of the fresh mixture uu = [u′ u,1, uu,2 + u′ u,2 ] + O ( Pe−1 ), the ﬂame normal and tangential velocity compo- nents just upstream of the ﬂame sheet can be computed from n f,i uu,i and t f,i uu,i, which results in uu,⊥ = uu,2 + u′ u,2 + O ( Pe−1 ) and uu,∥ = uu,2 ∂ξ ∂x 1 + u′ u,1 + O ( Pe−1 ), (5.03) Secondary Interactions respectively. Using these equations together with Eq. (5.01), we get for the mean quan- tities [ u 2 ] b u= s 0 L E (5.04) [ p ] b u = −(s 0 L )2 ρu E (5.05) [ u 1 ] b u= 0, (5.06) where the assumption of a stationary ﬂame front of the unperturbed ﬂow requires uu,2 = s 0 L and E = ρu /ρb − 1 denotes the non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume. Hence, across the ﬂame front the ﬂow is accelerated by a factor e = (E + 1) in x 2 - direction and the static pressure decreases by a term (s 0 L )2 ρu E. Application of the jump conditions for the perturbed ﬂow ﬁeld results in [ u′ ] b u= E ( u′ u,2 − ∂ξ ∂t ) + O ( Pe−1 ) (5.07) [ p ′] b u= −2ρu s 0 L [ u′ ] b u + O ( Pe−1 ) (5.08) [ u′ ] b u= −s 0 L E ∂ξ ∂x 1 + O ( Pe−1 ), (5.09) while the equation governing the kinematics of the ﬂame sheet s L = uu,⊥ − ∂ξ/∂t leads to u′ u,2 − ∂ξ ∂t = s L − uu,2 + O ( Pe−1 ). (5.010) Neglecting Flame Stretch When Landau assessed the stability of planar ﬂames, he assumed a constant ﬂame speeds L = s 0 L + O ( Pe−1 ) and, thus, neglected stretch effects. Note that this as- sumption is perfectly in line with the neglect of terms that are of higher than zeroth order in 1/ Pe. Inserting the constant ﬂame speed assumption into Eqs. (5.07)–(5.09), the jump conditions write [ u′ ] b u= O ( Pe−1 ), [ p ′] b u= O ( Pe−1 ) and [ u′ ] b u= −s 0 L E ∂ξ ∂x 1 + O ( Pe−1 ). (5.011) From Eq. (5.010) it follows that the ﬂame front moves in response to upstream velocity perturbations according to∂ξ/∂t = u′ u,2 + O ( Pe−1 ). While pressure and ﬂame-normal velocity ﬂuctuations are continuous across the ﬂame, ﬂame-tangential velocity per- turbations change, as stated by Eq. (5.011). Considering Flame Stretch Now consequences of ﬂame stretch shall be investigated by including terms up to O ( Pe−1 ) to the analysis. As already mentioned in Sec. 1.02.03, in the limiting case of 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback high activation energies of the global reaction, this shall only add a new stretch de- pendent term to the ﬂame speed relation, while the jump conditions Eqs. (5.07)–(5.09) remain the same. This approximation is in line with the phenomenological stretch- related correction of Markstein and justiﬁed by the strong dependency of the ﬂame speed to temperature in the case of a high activation energy of the global reac- tion. Assuming that the Markstein number for ﬂow strain and ﬂame curvature is the same, the equation for the ﬂame speed writes s L = s 0 L (1 − l M κs ) (5.012) with the Markstein length l M and the ﬂame stretch κs. Using this relation together with Eq. (5.010) we get u′ u,2 − ∂ξ ∂t = −l M κs. (5.013) This extended relation of the ﬂame sheet kinematics is now inserted to the jump conditions Eqs. (5.07)–(5.09) and we obtain [ u′ ] b u= −E l M κs (5.014) [ p ′] b u= −2ρu s 0 L [ u′ ] b u (5.015) [ u′ ] b u= −s 0 L E ∂ξ ∂x 1. (5.016) While the jump conditions (5.016) for the tangential velocity u′ 1 remain unchanged compared to the case without ﬂame stretch, the other two now contain ﬂame stretch related quantities. These new terms reﬂect the fact that changes in the ﬂame speed affect the local volume production per unit lengthm = E s L of the ﬂame sheet, see Eq. (3.07). Hence, concave parts of the ﬂame now produce more volume since the ﬂame propagation speed is increased here, and vice versa for convex parts. A stretch dependent ﬂame speed, as expressed in Eq.(5.013), is one of the most impor- tant mechanisms that dampens ﬂame front displacements by imposing ﬂame speed variation in convex/concave regions. Following the analysis conducted in Sec. 1.03.02, it has a diffusion-like effect on the ﬂame dynamics. Consequently, sharp displace- ments are smeared in space. 5.02.02 Modeling of Flame Generated V orticity Based on the jump conditions derived in the previous section, a model for the pro- duction of vorticity by a perturbed ﬂame sheet shall now be deduced. T o this end, the jump in the tangential velocity component of Eqs. (5.09) or (5.016) is revisited, since it quantiﬁes the amount of vorticity generated across the ﬂame sheet. This can be shown by computing the circulation around a closed surface as depicted in Fig. 5.04. Secondary Interactions Figure 5.04: Illustration of the line integral of Eq. (5.017) along a path ∂S enclosing a surface S. The lower side of this rectangular surface is assumed to be just inside the domain of the unburned ﬂuid, whereas all other sides are inside the burned region. W e obtain for the circulation of an inﬁnitesimally small surface dΓ= ∮ ∂S ui dxi = −u′ b,1 dx 1 − u′ b,2 (x 1 )dx 2 + u′ u,1 dx 1 + u′ b,2 (x 1 + dx 1 )dx 2 = ∂u′ b,2 ∂x 1 dx 1 dx 2 − [ u′ ] b udx 1, (5.017) where it is assumed that the streamwise component of the ﬂow just upstream of the ﬂame does not vary along the ﬂame sheet, i. e.∂u′ u,2 /∂x 1 ≡ 0. Furthermore, also the ﬂame tangential velocity is assumed to be constant along the sheet. This results in an expression for the circulation, which is related to vorticity by a surface integral dΓ= ∫ S ωd A. Hence, a perturbed ﬂame acts as a vortex sheet of strength ∂Γ ∂x 1 = ∂u′ b,2 ∂x 1 dx 2 − [ u′ ] b u. (5.018) As shown in Sec. 5.02.01, variations of ﬂame-normal velocity of combustion products u′ b,2 along the ﬂame sheet result only from ﬂame stretch effects, i. e. consequences of ﬂame curvature and ﬂow strain. Combining Eq. (5.018) with the jump condition of Eq. (5.014) and (5.016) assuming∂u′ u,2 /∂x 1 ≡ 0, the stretch dependency of the ﬁrst term in Eqs. (5.018) becomes clear: ∂Γ ∂x 1 = −E l M ∂κs ∂x 1 dx 2 + s 0 L E ∂ξ ∂x 1. (5.019) Assuming the ﬂame front displacement may be of order O (ǫ) and dx 2 of order of the ﬂame thickness, the ﬁrst term in Eq. (5.019) is of the order O ( ǫl 2 M ). The second term in Eq. (5.019) is of order O (ǫ). Knowing that the Markstein length l M is a quantity of similar length as the ﬂame thickness, it becomes clear that the ﬁrst term in Eq. (5.019) is much smaller than the second one. Therefore, in the scope of this thesis, only the second term in Eq. (5.019) shall be of interest and, thus, ﬂame stretch related effects on ﬂame generated vorticity are neglected. This is in line with the analysis conducted by Matalonet al. They reported that signiﬁcant jumps in vorticity result only from 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback Figure 5.05: Sketch of a harmonically perturbed ﬂame sheet including an illustrations of the consequences of ﬂame-generated vorticity, indicated by green cir- cular arrows. T ogether with the mechanism of geometrical focusing, see Sec. 5.02.03, this leads to the formation of in- and decreased ﬂow speeds at the ﬂame front, illustrated by the red and blue colored areas as well as the orange stream tubes. Flame stretch related variations of ﬂame speed are indicated by downward pointing small arrows of various lengths. baroclinic production assuming the ﬂow ﬁeld upstream of the ﬂame is vortical-free (irrotational). For a more complete analysis of the generation of vorticity by gasdy- namic discontinuities see the work of Hayes. More detailed considerations of ﬂame generated vorticity due to ﬂame stretch are, for example, found in the works of. From Eq. (5.019) it follows that ﬂame generated vorticity is maximum at inﬂection points of the ﬂame displacement. In Fig. 5.05 the effect of this vorticity is indicated by green circular arrows placed at points ofξ = 0. They lead to an acceleration and deceleration of the contracting (red) and expanding (blue) ﬂow tubes, respectively, and thus destabilize the perturbed ﬂame sheet. Since the work of Darrieus and Landau was based on the jump conditions shown in Sec. 5.02.01 neglecting ﬂame stretch, it can be concluded that ﬂame-generated vorticity is the driving mechanisms of the Darrieus-Landau instability. The modeling concept pursued in this work follows this result: V orticity, in form of point vortices, is distributed along the mean ﬂame sheet satisfying Eq. (5.019). These vortices would subsequently be advected by the mean ﬂow ﬁeld following Eq. (3.010). This advection process, however, shall be neglected. The suggested modeling concept distributes vorticity along the mean ﬂame position in form of point vortices. Such vortices, however, exhibit a ﬂow ﬁeld singularity at their center, which would lead to unbounded velocity magnitudes close to it. Since these vortices are placed very close to the ﬂame sheet, this could lead to undesired distortions of the resulting ﬂame front. Hence, viscous vortices will be used, where the vorticity is not concentrated in one singular point, but spatially distributed accord- ing to a Gaussian-like function. Such a vortex is known as the Lamb-Oseen vortex. Its vorticity distribution is obtained as an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for an initially singular point vortex. The complex conjugate of the vortical Secondary Interactions velocity ﬁeld of a Lamb-Oseen vortex is written as ˜uω(ξ) = −i Γ 2π ξ− ξ′ [ 1 − exp ( − ⏐ ⏐ξ− ξ′⏐ ⏐2 r 2 0,ω )], (5.020) where the velocity drops to zero at the vortex center ( ξ → ξ′). The vortex radius r 0,ω speciﬁes the radius where the induced circumferential velocity is maximum. For radii greater thanr 0,ω, the velocity distribution asymptotically approaches the one of a singular vortex, see Eq. (3.022). The vortex sheet assumed by this modeling approach has a thickness of the order of the ﬂame displaced O (ǫ). Hence, the vortex radius is always set to the prevailing displacement amplitude. The Markstein length l M, which quantiﬁes the thickness of a ﬂame sheet, is hereby used as a lower threshold for the vortex radius, i. e.r 0,ω > l M. It is ﬁnally emphasized that such an approach mimics the Darrieus-Landau mechanism, which also relies solely on ﬂame-generated vorticity. 5.02.03 Modeling of Geometrical Focusing In the case of acoustically excited burner-stabilized ﬂames, ﬂame front displacements may be imposed whose amplitudes are not small compared to a characteristic length scale of the perturbation. As shown in Eq. (4.02), acoustics interacts predominantly with the ﬂame base region exhibiting a characteristic length scale of about 0.06 L f. Knowing that the Darrieus-Landau mechanism will lead to a convective growth of the primary displacements, after some time a situation may occur where the displacement amplitudeǫ is no longer negligible compared to the characteristic perturbation length scale. Then the theory based on two ﬂow domains of constant spatial extension, which are coupled via the jump conditions introduced in Sec. 5.02.01 does not hold any more. In addition to the Darrieus-Landau mechanism, new phenomena may occur. One of them is geometrical focusing, which will be introduced in this section. The proposed extended modeling approach is based on a method that captures con- sequences of gas expansion across a perturbed ﬂame sheet. It essentially relies on existing modeling strategies, which represent a ﬂame sheet as a localized source of volume. Most studies realize such a volume production relying on discontinuous source panels, which are placed along the instantaneous ﬂame front position. The herein proposed method seizes this idea and extends it by using spatially distributed (Gaussian) volume sources instead of panels, which allow to resolve the inner structure of the ﬂame sheet and avoid unbounded velocity magni- tudes. More speciﬁcally, a Gaussian volume production kernel D (x ) is proposed and included into the modeling framework introduced in Chap. 3. Based on this general idea, a modeling concept is derived in the following, which has already successfully been implemented and tested by Zimmermann in the scope of his Bachelor’s thesis. T o the best knowledge of the author, no prior efforts have been made to analyze acoustics-ﬂame interactions based on such an approach. 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback Figure 5.06: Each of the three ﬁgures shows the amount of volume produced accord- ing to a number of Gaussian sources with kernel radiusr 0 distributed along a vertical line, where blue denotes zero and yellow maximum vol- ume production. The center of each Gaussian source is marked by a red dot ( ). The number of sources per length increases from left to right, while the sum of all source strengths is kept constant (taken from Zim- mermann, Fig. 5.08). The most elementary kernel, which could be used to represent the volume production kernel D (x ), is a Dirac Delta distribution δ(x ). Here, volume is produced only at one singular point. By continuously placing such point sources along a line, a line source emerges. Approximating the ﬂame front by a ﬁnite number of such lines results in a kinematic description of an inﬁnitely thin ﬂame sheet, since the ﬂow velocity im- mediately increases at the ﬂame by a ﬁxed value that depends on the respective line source strength. This approach has, for example been applied by Pindera and T albot. Here, another method is pursued, which is inspired by the Lamb-Oseen vortex introduced in the previous section. In analogy to this kind of vortex, a Gaussian-like volume source distribution is assumed. Computing the ﬂow ﬁeld associated to such a source in free space, results in an irrotational velocity ﬁeld ˜ue = S 2π ξ− ξ′ [ 1 − exp ( − ⏐ ⏐ξ− ξ′⏐ ⏐2 r 2 0,e )], (5.021) where S denotes the strength of the Gaussian source, just as in the case of a point source, see Eq. (3.021). Again, the ﬂow ﬁeld is ﬁnite-valued everywhere. Placing sev- eral such sources right next to each other results in a discretized version of a line source, but now with a smooth increase of velocity across it. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.06, where three different source distributions of increasing density, i. e. sources per length, are shown. While the individual sources are clearly distinguishable in the left ﬁgure, in the ﬁgure to the very right the given source distribution already re- sembles a line source very well — although only six sources are used. Generally, modeling approaches relying on Gaussian sources have to ensure that the distance between the individual sources is sufﬁciently smaller thanr 0,e. A distribution of volume sources along a line leads to an increase of the velocity com- ponent normal to that line. Fig. 5.07 visualizes this for a steady state ﬂame front along Secondary Interactions Figure 5.07: Left: Magnitude of ﬂow velocity evaluated along three stream lines (see right plot) plotted over the axial coordinate x 1. The theoretical veloci- ties far up- and downstream of the ﬂame are marked by horizontal black dashed lines. Right: Steady state ﬂow ﬁeld for Cr = 0.04. The ﬂame front (green) is represented by a number of Gaussian sources of kernel ra- diusr 0. The three stream lines (gray lines) referenced in the left plot are marked by corresponding line styles. Figure 5.08: Left: Axial velocity of a channel ﬂow including a vertical ﬂame sheet (methane-air,φ = 0.08) represented by Gaussian sources with kernel ra- dius r 0 ( ). Right: Flame normal velocity evaluated along the pink line shown in the left plot (pink line) compared to results of a 1 D simulation employing detailed chemical mechanism (red dashed line). The Gaussian sources are placed atx 1 = 0 and have a kernel radius of r 0,e = 0.053 mm (taken from Zimmermann, Fig. 5.06). which Gaussian volume source of strength S and radius r 0,e are distributed. Plotting the absolute velocity along three selected stream lines illustrates the acceleration of the ﬂow across the ﬂame sheet. Therefore,r 0,e has to be chosen such that the ﬂame normal velocity induced by the Gaussian sources optimally resembles the behavior imposed by a realistic combustion zone. In order to archive this, 1 D simulations of a steady ﬂame are conducted employing a detailed chemical reaction scheme. Re- 5.02 Modeling of Flame-Flow Feedback sults are compared to the ﬁelds relying on Gaussian sources in Fig. 5.08 1. The left plot of this ﬁgure shows a straight ﬂame stabilized inside a duct, along which Gaussian sources are uniformly distributed. The plot on the right hand side of Fig. 5.08 shows the ﬂame normal velocity inside the duct evaluated along the pink horizontal line shown in the left plot (pink line). Additionally, results of the detailed 1 D simulations are shown (red dashed line). Both curves coincide very well and only deviate on the downstream side of the ﬂame sheet, where the secondary reaction layer is placed, see Sec. 1.01.01. All in all, for the given value ofr 0,e, very good agreement between both combustion models is found. The velocity ﬁelds depicted in Figs. 5.07 and 5.08 are retrieved by placing a num- ber of Gaussian sources of kernel radiusr 0,e = 0.053 mm along a given steady state ﬂame front and placing a source of strength S = 2 u 1,blk Ri at x 1 = −∞(corresponds to ξ = 0 in the image domain). A Kutta condition is employed at the trailing edge for the setup shown in Fig. 5.07. Besides this, the only difference in the computations involved to create both ﬁgures is the choice of the respective Schwarz-Christoffel mapping (see Zimmermann for details). Considering the fact that the Gaussian sources should impact the ﬂow velocity down-and upstream of the ﬂame, it may be surprising that the velocity far upstream of the ﬂame asymptotes to u 1,blk while it ap- proaches Cr E u 1,blk on the downstream side. This point can be clariﬁed as follows: As shown in Fig. 3.04, the Gaussian sources are placed in the image domain along an arc starting fromξ = 1 and extending to negative values of ξ1. Impermeability boundary conditions demand an second arc of sources mirrored at the real axis. These two arcs enclose the ﬂow domain upstream of the ﬂame, where the ﬂow ﬁeld contributions of the individual Gaussian sources mostly annihilate each other. Considering a duct ﬂame, the superimposed contributions of all sources even perfectly vanish on the up- stream side of the ﬂame. This is a consequence of the fact that here the ﬂame front maps to a sphere around the origin in the image domain, which is symmetric with respect to the imaginary and the real axes. For the burner-stabilized ﬂame of Fig. 5.07, the arc shown in Fig. 3.04 is only symmetric with respect to the real axis. In conse- quence, a slightly negative ﬂow upstream of the ﬂame is induced by the Gaussian sources, which however is negligible as illustrated in Fig. 5.07 (the absolute velocities almost approach 1 for x 1 → −∞). Representing a ﬂame front by a number of Gaussian sources, leads to an uncondi- tional growth of ﬂame front displacements, as will be shown in the next section. Hence, together with the destabilizing effect of ﬂame-generated baroclinc vorticity, discussed in Sec. 5.02.02, two hydrodynamic mechanisms of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback are found — a vortical and an irrotational one. The former has already been covered in the discussion above. The latter can be understood by considering a perturbed ﬂame sheet, as depicted in Fig. 5.09. The combustion process imposes a volume production onto the ﬂow, which is an irrotational effect, and which can be captured by distribut- ing sources along the ﬂame sheet. This imposes, on the one hand, a discontinuity in 1 Computed with Cantera using the GRI-Mech 3.00 reaction mechanism Secondary Interactions Figure 5.09: Illustration of the perturbed ﬂow ﬁeld imposed by a displaced ﬂame sheet, which is represented by a number of Gaussian volume sources. The overall effect of these sources leads to a geometrical focusing of the ﬂow, i. e. an acceleration of the ﬂow in the vicinity of concave and a de- celeration in the vicinity of convex parts of the ﬂame, amplifying already existent ﬂame perturbations. ﬂame normal velocity across the ﬂame. On the other hand, additionally the ﬂow ﬁeld in the vicinity of the ﬂame is modiﬁed. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.09: Three sources placed at the inﬂection points of the perturbed ﬂame sheet are exemplarily highlighted (gray). Each imposes a velocity ﬁeld that points away from the center of the respec- tive source. Overall, this results in an increase of ﬂow velocity in the vicinity of the maxima of the displaced ﬂame sheet and, vice versa, a decrease at the minima. Alto- gether, this results in an accelerated ﬂow at concave and a decelerated ﬂow at convex parts of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Due to this dependency on ﬂame shape, this process is referred to asgeometrical focusing in the following. Just like the Darrieus-Landau mechanism relying on ﬂame-generated vorticity, geometrical focusing ampliﬁes ﬂame perturba- tions and constitutes a hydrodynamic ﬂame-ﬂow feedback mechanism. It essentially relies on movements of the mean ﬂame shape and is, hence, not accounted for if two coupled ﬂow domains of constant boundaries are assessed, as it is assumed in the scope of Darrieus-Landau’s problem discussed in Sec. 1.02.03. For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that geometrical focusing also leads to the occurrence of spatially varying tangential velocity perturbations, associ- ated with ﬂow strain. Their consideration, however, is explicitly neglected here. 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback The modeling framework introduced in Chap. 3 supplemented with the approaches outlined in this chapter shall now be applied to the ﬂame conﬁgurations analyzed in Chap. 4 (primary interactions). Since vortex shedding was found to only have a negligible impact on the ﬂame response, it is excluded from the analysis presented in the following. 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback Parameter V alue Expansion ratio e 6.068 Flame speed s 0 L 0.02686 m/s Flame thickness δD 83.095 µm Markstein number Ma 4 Gaussian source kernel radius r 0,e 0.053 mm T able 5.01: Flame parameters used for the computations of this chapter. An overview of the ﬂame parameters used for the computations of this chapter is provided in T ab. 5.01. The values fore, s L and δD are retrieved from 1 D simulations of lean methane-air ﬂames at φ = 0.08 relying on the software Cantera employing the GRI-Mech 3.00 reaction mechanism. The ﬂame thickness is estimated by a diffusion lengthδD = D t h/s L, where D t h denotes the thermal diffusivity. Following Eq. (5.012), the deﬁnition of the stretched ﬂame speed depends on the Markstein length l M, which is computed from δD and the Markstein number Ma via l M = δD Ma. Following Matalon et al, methane-air mixtures exhibit Markstein numbers roughly between 3 and 4. As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, we should expect an overprediction of displacement amplitudes when including ﬂame-ﬂow feedback into the modeling approach, since only driving and no damping mechanisms are considered. Damping mechanisms are usually associated with ﬂame stretch. In the modeling approach proposed here, only consequences of curvature-related stretch for the ﬂame speed are considered. Flow strain as well as stretch generated vorticity are neglected, which might signiﬁcantly underestimate the damping, as indicated by the study of Pindera and T albot. Hence, in the scope of this thesis only a qualita- tive analysis of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback mechanisms is possible and therefore, in a ﬁrst approximation, a Markstein number of 4 is assumed. Following Fig. 5.08, the kernel radius of all Gaussian sources is ﬁxed tor 0,e = 0.053 mm. Based on these assumptions, the model relying on the 1 D linear representation of the ﬂame dynamics of Eq. (3.016), a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping, a representation of the ﬂow ﬁeld by a ﬁnite number of ﬂow ﬁeld singularities and a Kutta condition is ready to be solved. Exactly the same setup as discussed in Chap. 4 is analyzed, but this time ﬂame-ﬂow feedback is included. Concerning the numerical details, Eq. (3.016) is integrated in time relying on an explicit Euler method together with a ﬁrst-order upwind discretization scheme for the advection and a second-order central scheme for the diffusion term. The ﬂame sheet is discretized using 100 sample points and the time step width is set such that a mesh Fourier number ofl M s 0 L ∆t /∆x 2 ≈ 0.005 is achieved. In each time step, Lamb-Oseen vortices are distributed along the mean ﬂame position (one vortex per sampling point), with their respective strength being computed from Eq. (5.016). Furthermore, Gaussian sources of kernel radius r 0,ω are placed along the instantaneous ﬂame front, with a density of 10 sources per millimeter. Their strengths depend on the local ﬂame speed, on the expansion ratio Secondary Interactions Figure 5.010: LOM predictions including ﬂame-generated vorticity of a harmonically forced ﬂame conﬁguration (at 120 Hz and an amplitude of 10% ublk ) for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.04.

The global heat release is evaluated using the linearized relations introduced in Chap. 6. The Kutta condition is applied as described in Sec. 4.02.02. The run times of the simulations shown in this chapter are of the order of one minute, if solely ﬂame generated vorticity is considered (Sec. 5.03.01), and of 10 minutes if gas expansion via Gaussian sources is taken into account (Secs. 5.03.02). The analysis is split into two parts: in the ﬁrst one, consequences of ﬂame generated vorticity are assessed in Sec. 5.03.01, which is analog to the Darrieus-Landau mech- anism. In the second part, Sec. 5.03.02 focuses on irrotational feedback mechanisms, namely geometrical focusing, by representing the ﬂame sheet by a number of Gaus- sian sources, which impose a jump in ﬂame normal velocity across the ﬂame sheet. All simulations are put into perspective by comparing them to the results of Chap. 4, where ﬂame-ﬂow feedback was neglected. 5.03.01 Flame Generated V orticity In a ﬁrst step, the role of ﬂame generated vorticity is investigated and the ﬂame nor- mal acceleration across the ﬂame sheet, captured by Gaussian sources, is not taken into consideration. Lamb-Oseen vortices are placed along the mean ﬂame front. Ac- cording to Eq. (5.016), their strength is proportional to the local ﬂame displacement gradient∂ξ/∂x F 1, the non-dimensional increase of speciﬁc volume E and the un- 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback Figure 5.011: Results of a simulation as described in Fig. 5.010, but for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.066. stretched ﬂame speed s 0 L. Since vorticity is generated all along the perturbed ﬂame sheet with maxima at the inﬂection points of ξ, its spatial distribution is modeled by Lamb-Oseen vortices whose kernel radii are set to the current maximum displacement amplitude. Furthermore, a minimum radius ofr 0,ω,min = 4.025 l M is assumed in order to avoid an overprediction of the imposed vortical velocity perturbations at the ﬂame sheet. Applying such a deﬁnition forr 0,ω,min ensures that the order of magnitude of the kernel radius cannot become smaller than the ﬂame thickness. Nevertheless, r 0,ω,min has to be regarded as an empirical parameter whose value is not rigorously de- rived from ﬁrst principles. Unfortunately, it signiﬁcantly affects the computed ﬂame response, as will be shown below. Figs. 5.010 and 5.011 show four snapshots of harmonically forced simulations of this model at Cr = 0.04 and Cr = 0.066, respectively. It is evident that consideration of ﬂame generated vorticity leads indeed to a convective growth of ﬂame front perturbations: right at the anchoring, hardly any ﬂame displacement is visible, whereas the ﬂame tip oscillates with signiﬁcant amplitude. Comparing the results of both conﬁnement ratios, we observe that the wave length and maximum displacement amplitude of the resulting ﬂame front perturbations varies: A more narrow conﬁnement seems to promote perturbations of longer wave lengths and lower displacement amplitudes. Furthermore, a considerable impact of the ﬂame sheet on the ﬂow of premixture is observable for both setups. Positive and negative axial velocity perturbations prop- agate from the ﬂame base region to its tip, similar as reported by Blanchardet al. It has, however, to be noted that, other than claimed by Blanchard et al, the vortical component of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback does most probably not fully explain the observed convected velocity perturbations, since the irrotational component has a signiﬁcant impact, as well, which will be shown in Sec. 5.03.02. Imposing an impulsive forcing, results in a response as depicted in 5.012. As expected, the response with and without ﬂame-ﬂow feedback agree att ∗ = 0 and then increas- ingly deviate from each other. Similar to the CFD data, negative and positive sec- ondary peaks develop and subsequently grow in amplitude while they are advected towards the ﬂame tip.

Furthermore, the responses predicted by the LOM is stronger than the respective CFD counterpart. Overall, the Cr = 0.04 low-order predictions match the respective CFD results better than the Cr = 0.066 ones. The damping behavior, presumably imposed by the presence of a rather narrow conﬁnement, seems to be underpredicted for the Cr = 0.066 setup. Nevertheless, a — compared to the acoustic LOM — improved agreement can be observed for both conﬁgurations. This improved agreement is also reﬂected by the corresponding impulse and fre- quency response data of the global heat release rate, which is shown in Fig. 5.013. At Cr = 0.04, CFD/SI ( ) and LOM ( ) predictions agree well, only small de- viations in phase/gain and the impulse response are observable. At Cr = 0.066, the acoustic LOM correctly captures the oscillatory behavior of the IR, however, the re- sponse deviates signiﬁcantly from the CFD/SI data aroundt ∗ = 0, see Fig. 5.013 b. Accordingly, the corresponding FTF gain curves are qualitatively different. The dras- tic reduction of the peak gain value of the Cr = 0.066 setup (compared to Cr = 0.04), can also be found in the acoustic LOM data ( ). All in all, the suggested low order modeling strategy results in reasonable response predictions, even at Cr = 0.066. Interpreting the results of the acoustic LOM including ﬂame generated vorticity, it should be kept in mind that they are based on an empirical parameterr 0,ω,min. Eval- uating the ﬂame responses for 10% lower and larger values of r 0,ω,min results in the 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase 0 1 2 − 8 − 4 t∗ [-] h∗ (a) Cr = 0.04 Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase 0 1 2 − 1. 5 1. 5 t∗ [-] h∗ (b) Cr = 0.066 Figure 5.013: IR and FR in terms of gain and phase at Cr = 0.04 and Cr = 0.066 as predicted by CFD/SI ( ) as well as by the acoustic LOM with ( ) and without ( ) consideration of ﬂame-generated vorticity (r 0,ω,min = 4.025 l M ). responses visualized in Figs. 5.014 a and 5.014 b, respectively. A reduction of the min- imum kernel radius leads to higher velocity amplitudes and, thus, to an increase of the FTF gain. Exactly the opposite behavior can be observed when the radius is in- creased. W e have to recognize that the low-order predictions are rather sensitive to variations inr 0,ω,min. That means that the quantitatively good agreement with the ref- erence CFD/SI data is the result of a parameter tuning, i. e. ﬁnding an optimal value forr 0,ω,min. Nevertheless, the fact that the model shows reasonable results for both conﬁnement ratios and, additionally, leads to qualitatively correct response predic- tions indicates that ﬂame generated vorticity may indeed be one important driving mechanism resulting from ﬂame ﬂow feedback. The rather simplistic treatment of ﬂame generated vorticity proposed in this section resulted in valuable insights in consequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. Its impact on the FTF could be shown to lead to gains exceeding unity. Furthermore, the ﬁndings of Blanchardet al could be corroborated stating that a perturbed ﬂame sheet acts as a vortex sheet whose upstream inﬂuence is responsible for the observed con- vected velocity perturbations. The present analysis contains the empirical parameter r 0,ω,min and it was shown that response predictions are quite sensitive to its exact value. Therefore, all results presented in this section are qualitative in nature. Quanti- tatively good agreement between LOM and CFD/SI data could be achieved by tuning r 0,ω,min. Future studies could reﬁne the analysis of ﬂame-generated vorticity by im- plementation of more detailed vorticity source terms, for example, relying on the Secondary Interactions Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase 0 1 2 − 8 − 4 t∗ [-] h∗ (a) r 0,ω,min = 90% 4.025 l M Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 -12π -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase 0 1 2 − 8 − 4 t∗ [-] h∗ (b) r 0,ω,min = 110% 4.025 l M Figure 5.014: IR and FR in terms of gain and phase at Cr = 0.04 as predicted by CFD/SI ( ) as well as by the acoustic LOM with ( ) and without ( ) consideration of ﬂame-generated vorticity.

This might possibly enable a quantitative assessment of the vortical component of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback. 5.03.02 Irrotational Flame-Flow Feedback A ﬂame usually imposes a signiﬁcant change in density on a ﬂow, which is caused by exothermic reactions releasing reasonable amounts of sensible enthalpy. Such a density change is accompanied by an expansion and, thus, an acceleration of the ﬂow across the ﬂame zone. This process is captured by means of Gaussian sources, which are placed along the perturbed ﬂame sheet and, hence, provoke a jump in ﬂame normal velocity. Their kernel radiir 0,e are adjusted in order to optimally match a realistic velocity proﬁle through the ﬂame front, see Fig. 5.08. Applying this technique, the problem arises that the steady state position of the ﬂame is a priori unknown, since the presence of a conﬁnement together with an combustion- induced expanding ﬂow alters the steady state ﬂow ﬁeld and, hence, also the corre- sponding ﬂame shape. This circumstance would require the computation of the steady state in a ﬁrst step, before the displacement dynamics could be eval- uated in a second. Employing a 2 D non-linear G-equation solver combined with a representation of the ﬂame by Gaussian sources, the steady state solution was com- puted by Zimmermann. Since this requires the availability of another solver as 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback Figure 5.015: LOM predictions including irrotational ﬂame-ﬂow feedback of a har- monically forced ﬂame conﬁguration (at 120 Hz and an amplitude of 10% ublk ) for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.04.

Each shows the current axial velocity perturbations u′ 1 (color), the mean ﬂame front position ( ), the perturbed ﬂame ( ) and, attached to the trailing edge, the Kutta panel. Figure 5.016: Results of a simulation as described in Fig. 5.015, but for a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.066. well as its seamless compatibility with the present framework, another approach is pursued here: The ﬂame normal ﬂow velocity resulting from the distributed sources is evaluated at all ﬂame points based on the initially speciﬁed steady state ﬂame front position before the simulation starts. The resulting values are then subtracted from the respective values at all later times. This ensures that the initially speciﬁed ﬂame position becomes a steady state of the posed problem and it is possible to apply the method introduced above without any further adjustments. The employed steady state of the Cr = 0.04 conﬁguration is illustrated in Fig. 5.07. Figs. 5.015 and 5.016 show results for a harmonically forced ﬂame. These conﬁgura- tions exactly corresponds to the setups shown in Figs. 5.010 and 5.011, but this time Gaussian sources are used to represent the generation of volume across a ﬂame.

Due to the now signiﬁcantly larger wave lengths of the imposed ﬂame sheet perturbations, this fact is harder to recognize. The Cr = 0.066 case shows hardly any spatial variations of the local displacement phase and only a rather small convective growth in perturbation amplitude. When interpreting theu′ 1 ﬁeld, it should be con- sidered that the deep red and deep blue parts right at the ﬂame front are caused by the fact that the ﬂame sheet moves: if the ﬂame propagates into the fresh mixture, the ve- locity at points placed inside the originally unburned ﬂow will be strongly increased compared to the steady state and, vice versa, if the ﬂame is pushed into burned parts. Hence, consequences of the sources for the ﬂow ﬁeld become only apparent further away from the ﬂame sheet. Respecting this fact, it is interesting to note that also the irrotational part of the ﬂame-ﬂow feedback imposes distinct convected velocity perturbations upstream of the ﬂame, at least for Cr = 0.04. Dipole-like irrotational perturbations are imposed onto the surrounding ﬂow ﬁeld, which is shown for the case of a perturbed duct ﬂame in Fig. 5.017 a 2: regions where the displacement shows local maxima (concave parts) behave as sources on the burned and as sinks on the unburned side of the ﬂame sheet. For regions at local minima (convex parts), it is the other way round. In consequence, the overall perturbation ﬂow ﬁeld might appear vortical, while it is irrotational in re- ality. This complicates a visual analysis of the ﬂow ﬁeld in the vicinity of perturbed ﬂames. Based on these ﬁndings, it has to be concluded that the description of Blan- 2 The computation of this ﬁgure employs exactly the same framework as the ones of Figs. 5.015 and 5.016, however, a different Schwarz-Christoffel mapping was applied in order to cope with the depicted duct geometry, see Zimmermann for details. 5.03 Analysis of the Impact of Flame-Flow Feedback 0 0. 5 1 − 1 2 Cr = 0. 4 t∗ = 0 ξ/ ˆξ [-] 0 0. 5 1 t∗ = 0. 2 0 0. 5 1 t∗ = 0. 41 0 0. 5 1 t∗ = 0. 61 Figure 5.018: Four snapshots taken at equidistant instances in time of the normal- ized ﬂame displacement resulting from an impulsive velocity forcing at t ∗ = 0 taken from CFD/SI results ( ), the acoustic LOM excluding ﬂame-ﬂow feedback ( ) and the acoustic LOM including irrotational gas expansion ( ) at a conﬁnement ratio of Cr = 0.04. chard et al is incomplete: a perturbed ﬂame sheet is more than just a vortex sheet of varying strength. One important difference between the setup respecting ﬂame-generated vorticity and the setup respecting irrotational gas expansion is that at Cr = 0.04 the latter exhibits a clearly non-linear output behavior of the global heat release, even for small ampli- tudes of the input velocity. The time series data of the global heat release rate asso- ciated with the simulations shown in Fig. 5.010 and 5.015 are depicted in Fig. 5.017 b. While the vortical output data ( ) is sinusoidal, the irrotational output ( ) shows a drop of the global heat release signal every time a maximum is reached. Such a be- havior is non-linear in nature and can be associated with the dynamics of the ﬂame tip. Once a positive ﬂame front perturbation reaches the ﬂame tip, this will eventually lead to a pinch-off of a bubble of unburned ﬂuid. When this bubble is burned, a rapid change in the global heat release rate is provoked. This process is not faithfully cap- tured by the model at hand, nevertheless, qualitatively something similar happens: A positive ﬂame displacement is usually followed by a negative one. In ﬂame coor- dinates, this might lead to the occurrence of negative displacements exceeding the symmetry line atx 2 = 0. This, of course, is not possible and the numerical algorithm disregards portions of the ﬂame sheet that are outside the ﬂow domain, i. e. x 2 < 0. That means, the heat release drops overproportionally fast, which manifests itself as the observed rapid drop of the global heat release rate. Regarding the simulations that respect only ﬂame generated vorticity, vortices are distributed along themean ﬂame position and not the displaced one, and hence also displacements with x 2 < 0 where allowed. This results in the good-natured output of this model. At Cr = 0.066 all forced simulations exhibited an essentially harmonic output signal at the forcing frequency (not shown), which shows that the presence of a conﬁnement signiﬁcantly dampens the impact of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, particularly its irrotational component. The observed convective growth of displacement amplitudes resulting from an im- Secondary Interactions pulsive velocity forcing is signiﬁcantly stronger for the irrotational gas expansion model than for the model that respects only ﬂame-generated vorticity. The result- ing ﬂame displacements of the former model are depicted in Fig. 5.018. Already at the second snapshot (t ∗ = 0.02) very high displacement amplitudes have formed. They subsequently grow even further in amplitude and, additionally, a variety of secondary displacements develop. This emphasizes the point made in the introduction of this chapter: capturing mainly mechanisms that are responsible for a growth of ﬂame front perturbations will most probably result in an overprediction of displacement ampli- tudes. This could possible be ﬁxed by including damping mechanisms. In the study shown here, consequences of ﬂame curvature were respected, however, the results clearly suggest that this is not sufﬁcient. An appropriate consideration of damping mechanisms is out of the scope of this work and should be analyzed in future studies. Finally, it should be pointed out that a joint analysis of both ﬂame-ﬂow feedback mechanisms, i. e. the irrotational and the vortical one, results in even higher dis- placement amplitudes than the ones shown here (not shown). Therefore, such a com- bined study is only instructive once damping mechanisms are adequately included into the modeling framework. This situation is very similar to what happened to the works of Darrieus and Landau : since their model included only driving mechanisms leading to the unconditional growth of ﬂame front perturbations, it was later complemented by Markstein introducing the empirical assumption of a curvature-dependent ﬂame speed. Concerning the present modeling approach, sim- ilarly, it turned out that there is a signiﬁcant lack of damping mechanism in order to achieve quantitative agreement with CFD/SI data. Therefore, in addition to the curvature dependency of the ﬂame speed, other mechanisms need to be assessed. 5.04 Summary and Conclusions In this chapter, consequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback for the acoustic ﬂame response were modeled and analyzed. A vortical and an irrotational mechanism resulting from gas expansion were found to be the driving forces that govern secondary acoustics- ﬂame interactions. While the former is known as the Darrieus-Landau mechanism relying on ﬂame-generated vorticity, the latter results from a geometrical focusing of accelerating effects of a perturbed ﬂame sheet and has, so far, not been analyzed in the context of acoustics-ﬂame interactions. Based on these two mechanisms, per- turbed ﬂames act as vortex sheets of varying strength (ﬂame-generated vorticity) as well as sheets of advected dipoles (irrotational gas expansion), which explains the occurrence of convected velocity perturbations upstream of the ﬂame. Furthermore, both mechanisms lead to the formation of secondary convectively growing displace- ments causing FTF peak gain values that signiﬁcantly exceed unity — just like it was predicted by the CFD/SI results. The presence of a narrow conﬁnement signiﬁcantly impacts the consequence of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, leading to ﬂame front displace- ments of longer wave lengths and lower amplitudes. Accordingly, the maximum FTF 5.04 Summary and Conclusions peak gain values are reduced. Qualitatively, mechanisms that could explain the discrepancies observed in Chap. 4 were found and promising modeling strategies were proposed. Contrary to the MS equation, as used by Searbyet al, the modeling framework proposed here al- lows to capture conﬁnement induced consequence for the ﬂame response. Relying on this new modeling approach, it was found that the previously neglected irrotational consequences of gas expansion led to an unphysically fast growth of ﬂame front dis- placements, such that the response dynamics left the linear regime. It is conjectured that this growth is in reality limited by some damping mechanisms, which were not included in the present study. Their investigation should be subject of future research, which then might also allows for quantitative assessments of the ﬂame dynamics. Furthermore, relying on the works of Oberleithneret al and Oberleithner and Paschereit, it would be interesting to analyze the role of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback driven instability mechanisms for technically relevant conﬁgurations, in analogy to shear layer instabilities. The main ﬁndings of the present analysis are: 1. Compact acoustics imposes irrotational ﬂow perturbations, which predomi- nantly displace the ﬂame base region. 2. These primary ﬂame front displacements are advected downstream by the mean ﬂow and are exposed to mechanisms of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback along their way to the ﬂame tip. 3. This feedback leads to the convective growth of displacement amplitudes and, additionally, creates new secondary ﬂame front perturbations. 4. These secondary perturbations lead to an oscillatory behavior of the impulse response (IR) of the global heat release rate. This, in turn, creates a pronounced peak in the gain of the associated frequency response at a frequency close to the oscillation frequency of the IR. 5. For the ﬂame conﬁguration at hand, two mechanisms of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback were identiﬁed: (i) the Darrieus-Landau mechanism relying on ﬂame generated vorticity and (ii) geometrical focusing resulting from a ﬂame-normal accelera- tion of the ﬂow across a perturbed ﬂame sheet. 6. Both mechanisms lead to the convective growth of ﬂame front perturbations and impose convected velocity perturbations upstream of the ﬂame front. Secondary Interactions Part III Generalization to Other Burner Conﬁgurations The analysis conducted so far analyzed Slit ﬂame setups. Most exper- imental and theoretical studies, however, report on Bunsen ﬂames. In order to provide a connection of both conﬁgurations, the impact of ﬂame geometry onto the acoustic ﬂame response shall be investigated in the following. For the sake of completeness, also W edge ﬂames are consid- ered. The results should provide guidance how to generalize the ﬁndings made for Slit ﬂame conﬁgurations as well as how to interpret data ob- tained using arbitrary ﬂame conﬁgurations. Major parts of Chap. 6 have already been published, see Steinbacher et al. Compared to this publication, Sec. 6.03 is newly added and some minor changes have been applied (wording, grammar). 6 Consequences of Flame Geometry Flame geometry (Slit, W edge or Bunsen) determines how ﬂame front displacements translate to global heat release rate ﬂuctu- ations, which deﬁnes geometry-speciﬁc response characteristics. Low-order models relying on a Gaussian kernel function are able to adequately capture the FTFs of all three geometries. V arious types of laminar ﬂame conﬁgurations are used in academia and technical ap- plications, which often exhibit very different response characteristics. Three of the most prominent geometries are depicted in Fig. 2.01: Bunsen, W edge (or V -) and Slit ﬂames. Most theoretical studies on analytical FTF models are concerned with Bunsen and W edge ﬂames, while only very few deal with Slit ﬂames. One reason for this might be that the latter are technically less relevant. Particularly for academic studies, however, Slit ﬂames are very interesting due to the simpler analytical treatment of the governing equations, see also the works presented in Part II of this thesis. T o date, no study has strictly and comprehensively analyzed the differences in the linear ﬂame response that result from ﬂame geometry. Schulleret al and Blu- menthal et al compared analytical response predictions of W edge and Bunsen ﬂames, but did not include Slit ﬂames. Schuller et al provided validation data from experiments solely for the Bunsen conﬁguration. Durox et al compared experimental response results of Bunsen, W edge and M-ﬂames, where the last one is a hybrid of the ﬁrst two types of ﬂames. They focused on the nonlinear behavior of the frequency response for increasing forcing amplitude levels and did not compare measurements to analytical predictions. Other studies assessing the consequences of ﬂame geometry examined the production of combustion noise of turbulent Slit and Bunsen ﬂames. Kotake and T akamoto experimentally investigated the impact of the nozzle shape (or burner mouth shape) on the acoustic power of the associated combustion noise for constant cross-sectional areas. They found that for lean con- ditions, rectangular nozzles (“slits”) produce signiﬁcantly higher levels of acoustic power than square and circular (Bunsen) shapes. A similar conclusion was drawn from numerical results by Pauschet al, who additionally found that Slit burn- ers exhibit a lower peak frequency than Bunsen type ones. Further, they located the position of maximum heat-release of the rectangular ﬂame at its tip, while it is a bit further upstream for the Bunsen ﬂame. Neither study analyzed the corresponding FTFs. Due to this lack of comprehensive studies on consequences of ﬂame geometry Consequences of Flame Geometry for the respective FTFs, a literature review for each of the three investigated conﬁgu- rations is provided in the following. For Bunsen type ﬂames, results for both experimentally determined and theoretically modeled FTFs are readily available, see e. g. [111, 115, 133, 144, 145, 158, 204–206]. Low-order models based on the so-called convective or incompressible-convective velocity model agree reasonably well with experimental data, see Sec. 2.02.01 (Low- Order Models) for details. T o the best knowledge of the author, there is a lack of literature regarding FTF anal- ysis and models for laminar Slit ﬂames that are validated against experimental or high ﬁdelity numerical data. On the one hand, several theoretical studies develop and investigate analytical models for the FTF of Slit ﬂames, how- ever, none of them compares results to experimental/high ﬁdelity numerical data. On the other hand, experimental and/or numerical investigations reporting on measured FTFs of Slit ﬂames [147–149, 208–210] do not compare their measurements to ana- lytical predictions. Only Duchaineet al presented an empirical model for the phase of Slit and Bunsen FTFs and compared it to experimental data, ﬁnding that the effective time lag of a Bunsen ﬂame is about half the value of a Slit conﬁguration. Further, Kornilovet al visually compare measured gain and phase values of a Bunsen and Slit setup, which shows a signiﬁcantly higher gain — even exceeding unity — of the Slit ﬂame. But again no model was developed and validated against this data. Finally, there is a group of studies that compared analytically predicted instantaneous ﬂame front positions of harmonically perturbed Slit ﬂames to experimental or high ﬁdelity numerical data, however, they did not evaluate transfer functions of the global heat-release rate. All of them rely on a G-equation based approach where the speed of a convective velocity perturbation was ﬁtted in order to achieve good agreement of the resulting perturbed ﬂame front with the comparison data. From the good match in terms of ﬂame front position, a very similar behavior of the corresponding global heat-release dynamics at the considered forcing frequency can be inferred. However, since the responses were only computed at a few forcing frequencies, it is not possible to deduce an FTF from those studies. There are several experimental studies reporting measured FTFs of W edge ﬂames, e. g. but they are all lacking a comparison to theoretical predictions. The studies performed by Schulleret al and Blumenthal et al develop analytical FTF models for Bunsen and W edge ﬂames, but compare only the response of the Bunsen type setup to experimental data. Finally, Schuller developed a modeling approach, which was validated against experimental data. At the same time, however, he mentions the difﬁculties in deriving an analytical model for such burner stabilized W edge ﬂames, which essentially arises from a strong interaction of the ﬂame with vortical structures shed from the burner mouth. Other W edge type ﬂames found in the literature are swirl stabilized ﬂames, which depend on variations 6.01 T est Case Setups of the turbulent burning velocity, axially convected velocity disturbances, as well as on convected swirl waves [79, 215–217]. Modeling of the FTF requires an adequate description of all those effects. This complicates the analysis and shifts the focus away from geometrical consequences. The study presented in the following aims to generate a more profound understanding of the consequences of ﬂame geometry by comparing analytical FTF predictions of Slit, W edge and Bunsen type ﬂames to each other and analyzing the origin of the dis- crepancies found. For the ﬁrst time, Slit and W edge ﬂame FTF predictions resulting from high ﬁdelity computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations are compared to analytical model predictions. The unique feature of the W edge ﬂame setup consid- ered in our study is that it is not dominated by vortex-ﬂame interaction, as it is the case for a burner stabilized ﬂame, since no burner mouth is involved. Therefore, a clean validation basis for analytical models is provided for all three geometries. It is found that the widespread G-equation framework, combined with a convective ve- locity model, is not able to adequately predict the ﬂame response of Slit ﬂames. In order to overcome this limitation, an extension of the well-known velocity models is introduced, which relies on a Gaussian kernel function in order to add some temporal dispersion to the transfer function model. The analysis is structured as follows: In Sec. 6.01 the three test case setups are intro- duced, which are used to validate the theoretical models. For each ﬂame conﬁgura- tion steady-state and transient numerical simulations are performed and the respec- tive ﬂame transfer function are identiﬁed from broad-band input/output data using means of system identiﬁcation (SI). The overall heat-release rate, evaluated as the integral over the ﬂame surface, plays a crucial role in the analysis of ﬂame geometry- related response differences. Peculiarities of the various ﬂame conﬁgurations on the one hand, and of the coordinate system on the other hand are detailed in Sec. 6.02. The here gained mathematical expressions are elucidated by descriptive physical rea- soning based on a model that solely relies on displacements of the ﬂame anchoring in Sec. 6.03. In Sec. 6.04, incompressible-convective velocity models with Dirac and Gaussian kernel functions are introduced, respectively for all ﬂame conﬁgurations considered. Properties of the Dirac kernel based models are discussed in Sec. 6.05 and, in particular, the ﬂame geometry-related differences in the ﬂame response are explicated. Finally, in Sec. 6.06 FTF predictions of the various velocity models are validated against CFD data, as well as against experimental data taken from the liter- ature. 6.01 T est Case Setups Transient and steady state numerical simulations employing well-established means of computational ﬂuid dynamics of three ﬂame conﬁgurations are performed and serve as a validation basis, see Appendix A.2.01 for details.

For all conﬁgurations, the location of maximum heat release (green) and the analytically predicted mean ﬂame front ( ) are shown (taken from ). series data resulting from broad-band forced simulations, FTFs are identiﬁed by means of system identiﬁcation (SI) employing a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) model as described in Appendix A.2.02. Three setups are considered and the respective steady state solutions are depicted in Fig. 6.01. All setups are chosen to be as simple as possible in order to serve as a clean reference that exhibits any geometry-related characteristics in a clear man- ner. Further, the mechanisms governing the ﬂame response to acoustic perturbations should be similar for all cases, i. e. similar Reynolds numbers and negligible interac- tion with vortical structures shed from the burner mouth for the W edge conﬁguration. This shedding process is suppressed by adding a straight lateral wall constraining the ﬂame, see Fig. 6.01 b. Note that all conﬁgurations exhibit a small recirculation zone since the ﬂow cannot follow the sharp edge at the inlet to the combustion chamber. Following Chap. 4, however, acoustically triggered shedding of vorticity from this edge has only a negligible impact on the linear ﬂame response. For the Slit and Bunsen setups, a feed duct and combustion chamber with a half- diameter of Ri = 5 mm and Ra = 12.05 mm are used, respectively (Fig. 6.01). The 6.02 Integral Heat-Release W edge ﬂame setup has the same feed duct height of 5 mm as the other two cases and a rod radius of Rr = 3.05 mm, which results in a combustion chamber radius of Ra = 8.05 mm. At the inlet, a uniform ﬂow proﬁle of axial velocity u 1 = 1 m/s with a temperature of 300 K is imposed for all setups. Further, zero pressure gradients at the inlet and a ﬁxed pressure are assumed, as well as a zero axial velocity gradient at the outlet. No swirl of the ﬂow is imposed. All walls are set to be adiabatic, except from the feed duct wall, which is set to a ﬁxed temperature of 300 K, and the combustion chamber back plate, which is set to TBP = 700 K. This conﬁguration correspond to a Reynolds number of Re = 620, which is computed with the mean inlet velocity, the feed duct diameter and the kinematic viscosity of the fresh mixture. 6.02 Integral Heat-Release For all three geometrical conﬁgurations considered, the integral heat-release rate is proportional to the respective ﬂame surface area A f (t ) = ∫ A d S. Hence, evaluation of surface area ﬂuctuations A′ f (t ) = A f (t ) − A f of a perturbed ﬂame up to contributions of order O (ǫ) allows to retain the ﬂame geometry speciﬁc heat-release dynamics. This leads to qualitatively very different results for the three ﬂame geometries, as shown in the following. One assumption made in this analysis is that the ﬂame is stifﬂy anchored at its base, i. e. this point is not allowed to move. This assumption is justiﬁed by the fact that the impulse response for Slit ﬂames shows no signal aroundt = 0, see Sec. 6.06. If the ﬂame base would move, a displacement would directly lead to a ﬂuctuation of the heat-release rate 1. A second assumption is that all ﬂames considered are symmetric, i. e. it is sufﬁcient to analyze only one half of the ﬂame front, see Fig. 1.013. A point on the ﬂame front at the symmetry axis consequently ﬂuctuates in axial direction, which is best captured using laboratory coordinates and the ﬂame front displacement η′. These two assumptions are important, since they deﬁne the possible directions of movement of the ﬂame boundaries (tip and anchoring), which is crucial for the evaluation of the linearized surface area, as will be shown below. For the computation of the FTF a variety of coordinate systems have already been adopted in the literature, see e. g. However, to date no study has comprehensively scrutinized the derivations of the ﬂame surface area with respect to the coordinate systems used, nor have the geometry dependent peculiarities ever been pointed out explicitly. Indeed, a technical note by Humphreyet al provides ev- idence that this issue deserves more attention: They reported that the expression for 1 Purely ﬂame normal displacements of the ﬂame-anchoring would also not cause any O (ǫ) ﬂuctu- ations of the ﬂame surface area, see discussion on Fig. 6.03 below. Hence, strictly speaking, it is not possible to infer from a zero response att = 0 of the Slit IR that the ﬂame base is actually stifﬂy an- chored — it could also be displaced normally. In the 1 D linearized G-equation framework, however, the implications for the modeling are the same in both cases and, hence, it is decided to proclaim the more straight forward assumption of a stifﬂy anchored ﬂame. Consequences of Flame Geometry Figure 6.02: Illustration of the dependency of the change of the ﬂame line segment lengthd S′ = d S − d S on the displacements d η′ i and d η′ i +1 up to O (ǫ) contributions. For conical ﬂames, also the radii r and r of the geometrical centers of the line segments are important. The region of the unburned ﬂuid is ﬁlled in gray. the linearized ﬂame surface area of a Slit ﬂame seems to depend on the coordinate system used. T o resolve this counterintuitive ﬁnding, Humphreyet al proposed to use frequency dependent integration limits, which result in coordinate system spe- ciﬁc correction terms. In this section, this issue is revisited and it is sought to provide a more intuitive understanding by not limiting our analysis to the frequency domain. Further, a more global context is provided by considering three technically relevant ﬂame geometries. The geometrical analysis starts by focusing on a single 1 D line segmentd S of a ﬂame front, see Fig. 6.02. The notation used in the following is illustrated in Fig. 1.013, where η′ denotes the axial displacement of the ﬂame front using laboratory coordinates. It is displaced by η′ i at node i and η′ i +1 at node i +1 with reference to the corresponding steady-state line segment d S. Hence, we write the length of the displaced segment, using the Pythagorean theorem, up to the leading order in the axial displacement as d S = √ ( d x L )2 + ( ηi +1 + η′ i +1 − ηi − η′ i )2 =    √ 1 + ( d η d x L )2 d x L    d S + d η d x L d η′ √ 1 + ( d η d x L )2 + O ( (d η′)2 )    d S′ (6.01) with the difference of the steady-state axial distances d η = ηi +1 − ηi and the transient distances dη′ = η′ i +1 − η′ i, as well as the lateral distance d x L 2. The second line results from a T aylor series development of the term in the ﬁrst line around d η′ = 0. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (6.01) denotes the length of the steady-state line segment and the second 6.02 Integral Heat-Release Figure 6.03: Displaced ﬂame segment in ﬂame aligned (blue) and laboratory (red) coordinates. its change due to η′ i /i +1. By applying the trigonometric relation cot(α) = d η/d x L 2, the linearized variation of the line segment length is transformed to d S′ = d s′ i + d s′ i +1 = cos(α) ( η′ i +1 − η′ i ). (6.02) From this expression it can directly be deduced that up to the ﬁrst order in d η′ the change of the line segment depends on the ﬂame parallel ( x F 1 -) component of the displacements ds ′ i /i +1, see Fig. 6.02. The elongation d s′ i +1 counts positive, while d s′ i contributes with a negative sign. As pointed out in Sec. 1.03.02, for small displacements, the perturbed ﬂame front can equivalently be described in ﬂame aligned and laboratory coordinates. In order to analyze the consequences of a change of the coordinate system for the computation of the linearized surface area ﬂuctuations, again a single displaced ﬂame segment shall be analyzed (Fig. 6.03, red). Nodei may be ﬁxed and node i + 1 be axially displaced by η′ i +1. Following Eq. (6.02), this would result in a linearized change of the segment length of d S ′ = cos(α)η′ i +1. Transforming this situation to ﬂame aligned coordinates by application of a relation ξi +1 = η′ i +1 sin(α) results in the segment shown in blue. However, the linearized change of the resulting segment length d S F = √ ( dx F )2 + dξ2 = dx F 1 d S F +O ( dξ2 )    d S ′F (6.03) vanishes to leading order since the displacement ξi +1 has no component parallel to the mean ﬂame front. Hence, paradoxically, a displacement η′ i +1 only imposes a change of the linearized line segment length in laboratory coordinates, and not in ﬂame aligned coordinates. This can be resolved by realizing that the aforementioned transformation fromη′ to ξ is incomplete: In order to equivalently describe the axially displaced ﬂame front Consequences of Flame Geometry (Fig. 6.03, red) using ﬂame aligned coordinates, the displacement ˆξi +1 = η′ i sin(α) should not be applied at node i + 1, but at a position shifted by a distance ds ′ i +1 further to the right (Fig. 6.03, orange). V ice versa, in order to describe a normally dis- placed ﬂame front (Fig. 6.03, blue) using laboratory coordinates, the respective node i+ 1 for η′ i +1 would have to be shifted to the left by ds ′ i +1. In doing so, the ﬁrst order change of the segment length stays the same in both coordinate systems. Therefore, it is concluded that — other than for the ﬂame dynamics described by Eq. (1.032) — a transformation of the coordinate system has non-trivial implications regarding the evaluation of the linearized change of the ﬂame length and, thus, also the respective ﬂame surface area. Depending on the given behavior of the ﬂame, possible elongations or shortenings of the ﬂame length not covered by the chosen coordinate system have to be accounted for correctly. Adding contributions of ﬂame movement not parallel to one of the employed coordinates is equivalent to imposing varying integration limits when evaluating the ﬂame surface integral. Other than pro- posed by Humphreyet al, terms resulting from such varying limits should not be regarded as correction terms since they are a mathematical necessity for solving a well deﬁned problem. This will be explicated in the following for the individual ﬂame geometries. Slit Flames The ﬂame surface area of Slit ﬂames (index “slit”) is given by an integral A f,slit (t ) = ∆x 3 ∫ l f (t ) ds, (6.04) where l f (t ) is the length of the displaced ﬂame surface proﬁle line and ∆x 3 the ex- tension of the ﬂame in x L 3 direction. Using laboratory coordinates, the arc length ds (Fig. 6.04) is expressed as ds = √ 1 + ( dη/dx L )2 dx L 2, see Eq. (6.01). Linearization re- sults in a surface area ﬂuctuation A′ f,slit (t ) = −cos(α) ∆x 3 ∫ Ri ∂η′ ∂x L dx L = ∆x 3 cos(α) η′ (0, t ), (6.05) where the anchoring boundary condition η′⏐ ⏐ x L 2 =Ri = 0 has been applied and Ri is the base half-diameter of the ﬂame. This leads to the result that surface area ﬂuctuations of stifﬂy anchored Slit ﬂames, to leading order,only result from movements of the ﬂame tip. As stated above, in ﬂame aligned coordinates a varying upper integration limit has to be considered for evaluation of the ﬂame surface integral. Inserting the corresponding 6.02 Integral Heat-Release Figure 6.04: Geometric measures required for the computation of the ﬂame surface area of Bunsen ﬂames. arc length, see Eq (6.03), and integration limits, the respective surface integral becomes A f,slit (t ) = ∆x 3 ∫ L f +∆L f (t )    √ 1 + ( ∂ξ ∂x F )2    =1+O (ǫ2 ) dx F = ∆x 3 [ ∫ L f d x F 1 + ∫ L f +∆L f (t ) L f dx F 1 + O ( ǫ2 )], (6.06) with the elongation/shortening of the ﬂame length ∆L f (t ) (Fig. 6.04). The ﬁrst term in Eq.(6.06) denotes the mean ﬂame surface area, the second one the contribution due to the elongation of the ﬂame. As illustrated in Fig. 6.03, the ﬂame tip contribution is of the same order asξ and has, thus, to be considered for the linear analysis. The variation of the ﬂame length ∆L f (t ) has to be determined from the ﬂame normal displacement ξ in order to close the ﬂame aligned modeling approach. From Fig. 6.03 we recall the relation between ξ and η′ at the ﬂame tip: ξ(L f, t ) = η′(0, t ) sin(α). Using this relation, we compute the variation of the ﬂame length, which corresponds to an elongation d s′ i +1 = cos(α)η′ i +1 in Fig. 6.03. Hence, we get ∆L f (t ) = ξ ( L f, t ) cos(α)/ sin(α), which, with use of Eq. (6.06), results in an expression for the surface area ﬂuctuation A′ f,slit (t ) = ∆x 3 tan(α) ξ ( L f, t ) (6.07) that is equivalent to Eq. (6.05). The only coordinate system that does not require a varying upper integration limit is the laboratory one, which is therefore considered to be the most natural one for the ﬂame surface area integral for the conﬁguration considered (symmetric, stifﬂy anchored Slit ﬂame). Consequences of Flame Geometry Bunsen Flames For conical ﬂames in general (index “con”) we have to consider the radius r of the geometrical center of a line segment. Using the steady-state ﬂame segment radius r, we retrieve A′ con= 2π r d S′ for the change in ﬂame surface area of one single ﬂame element, see Fig. 6.02. The ﬂame surface integral is written as A f,con (t ) = 2π ∫ l f (t ) r f (s, t ) d s (6.08) where s is the parametrization of the ﬂame front proﬁle, l f (t ) its transient length and r f (s, t ) its local radius, see Fig. 6.04. For Bunsen ﬂames (index “ Λ”), using ﬂame aligned coordinates, with a decomposition into mean and ﬂuctuating quantities, this results in an expression A f,Λ(t ) = 2π ∫ L f +∆L f (t ) [ Ri − x F 1 sin(α) + ξcos(α) ] dx F 1. (6.09) Here, L f is the mean ﬂame length, ∆L f (t ) its transient variation in ﬂame coordinates and Ri the ﬂame base radius. As in the Slit ﬂame case, the upper integration limit is time dependent: Wrinkles reaching the ﬂame tip impose a change in ﬂame height H f and, hence, also in the upper integration limit, which is required to capture this effect, see Fig. 6.04. For Bunsen ﬂames, this additional transient contribution to the ﬂame surface area, however, does not contribute to the linear approximation of the ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuation. An increase of the ﬂame height by∆H f (t ) = ∆L f (t )/ cos(α) would add the surface of a cone with both base radius and height of order O (ǫ). There- fore, the lateral surface area of this cone is of the order O ( ǫ2 ) and is thus neglected in linear considerations for anchored ﬂames: A′ f,Λ(t ) = 2πcos(α) ∫ L f ξdx F 1. (6.010) Hence, the global linearized ﬂame surface ﬂuctuation is computed from the integral of the displacements. W edge Flames W edge ﬂames (index “V”) are conical ﬂames, as well. Hence, the surface integral of Eq.(6.08) also holds for them and, using a ﬂame aligned coordinate system and a corresponding parametrization of the local ﬂame radiusr f (s, t ), we retrieve the linearized ﬂame surface area A f,V (t ) = 2π ∫ L f +∆L f (t ) [ Rr + x F 1 sin(α) − ξcos(α) ] dx F = A f,V + 2π [ Ra ∆L f (t ) − cos(α) ∫ L f ξd x F ], (6.011) 6.02 Integral Heat-Release Figure 6.05: Geometric measures required for the computation of the ﬂame surface area of W edge ﬂames. which results with ∆L f (t ) = ξ(L f, t )/ tan(α) in a surface area ﬂuctuation A′ f,V (t ) = 2πcos(α) [ Ra sin(α) ξ ( L f, t ) − ∫ L f ξdx F ]. (6.012) Similar to the Slit case, ﬂuctuations in the ﬂame height add or subtract the surface of a cone with a base radius of the order of the maximum ﬂame radius Ra and a height of the order O (ǫ), see Fig. 6.05. In total, the ﬂame tip movement ∆H f (t ) would add a O (ǫRa ) contribution to the ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuations, which is signiﬁcant. As a result, the linearized surface ﬂuctuations of stifﬂy anchored W edge ﬂames is expressed as the (negative) integral of the deﬂection from the mean, plus the ﬂame tip movement.

It is concluded that the computation of the linearized ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuation requires a consideration of the possible ﬂame movements at the boundaries for all ge- ometrical conﬁgurations. A coordinate system should be chosen that allows a proper description of this movement, otherwise, the elongation/shortening of the ﬂame ne- cessitates varying integration limits. This procedure is in particular important for Slit and W edge ﬂames, where the ﬂame tip adds a leading order contribution to the lin- earized ﬂuctuation of the ﬂame surface area. All formulas concerning the ﬂame front and the integral heat-release are summarized in T ab. 6.01 for the three geometries and the two coordinate systems considered. Also expressions for the convection speed, required for the convective velocity models, are provided in this table. They will be explained in detail in Sec. 6.04. 6.03 Physics Based Illustration of the Heat Release Dynam- ics So far, formulas for ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuations up to contributions of order O (ǫ) have been derived mathematically for three ﬂame geometries. In this section, these formulas shall be elucidated by physical reasoning based on a model that solely relies on displacements of the ﬂame anchoring. Instead of assessing variations in the ﬂame surface area, changes of the volume of unburned ﬂuid upstream of the ﬂame shall be considered. This concept allows for a descriptive and simple way to grasp the mathematical results of the previous section. Let us set up a thought experiment: a stationary Bunsen-type ﬂame shall be supplied with an extra amount of fresh mixture of the volume Ve by impulsively increasing the inﬂow velocity for a short amount of time. Since this process shall happen very fast, the ﬂame cannot immediately consume this extra volume of premixture and, thus, it shall solely lead to a very narrow displacement of the ﬂame front at its anchoring position, as illustrated in Fig. 6.06. Effects of non-linear ﬂame propagation (Huygens’s Principle; see Fig. 1.06) and ﬂame stretch shall be neglected, which means that this newly created ﬂame pocket is advected downstream without changing its shape, as predicted by Eq. (1.032) forl M ≡ 0. Note, that this does not faithfully represent what Consequences of Flame Geometry (a) Slit (b) Bunsen (c) W edge Figure 6.07: Sketch of an advected ﬂame pocket, which is generated by an impulsive deﬂection of the ﬂame base, shown for three ﬂame conﬁgurations (see Fig. 6.06). Assuming a Dirac impulse forcing, the ﬂame is displaced only at one point (indicated in blue), while a Gaussian impulse would impose a smooth ﬂame displacement as visualized here. would happen in reality, but let us disregard this fact for a moment in order to create a simple model that helps to understand geometry related differences of the ﬂame response. The ﬂame shapes resulting from such a forcing are plotted for all three ﬂame geome- tries in Fig. 6.07. For all cases, a small pocket of unburned ﬂuid is formed (position I), which is advected along the ﬂame front with the velocity u∥ such that it reaches positions II and III at subsequent times. The extra ﬂuid, trapped in the pocket, will lead to an increase of the global heat release rate of the ﬂame at the very moment it is burned. Since all of the initially supplied extra volume Ve is conserved, the global heat release rate does not change with respect to the steady state at t = 0. W e will see in the following that the process of how the pocket is burned depends strongly on ﬂame geometry. Firstly a Slit type ﬂame, as depicted in Fig. 6.07 a, is analyzed. Here, the volume of unburned ﬂuid inside the pocket remains constant during the advection process. The rate at which fuel is burned by the ﬂame is the same as in the steady state case and is not affected by the presence of the described pocket. Hence, the integral heat release rate remains constant for all pocket positions I, II and III. Once the pocket reaches the ﬂame tip, however, the volume of ﬂuid trapped inside the pocket is consumed since it cannot be advected any further. In real ﬂames this might lead to pinch-off effects or an elongation of the ﬂame front. In any case, the pocket is burned and the integral heat release rate of the ﬂame is increased at the moment when the displacement reaches the ﬂame tip. This agrees with the mathematical result of Sec. 6.02, which states that ˙Q ′ is proportional to movements of the ﬂame tip. The situation is different for Bunsen ﬂames, see Fig. 6.07 b. While the pocket is ad- vected, its radial position r is reduced and, hence, the trapped volume of ﬂuid is constantly depleted along the way from position I to III. Thus, volume Ve is con- tinuously reduced, which leads to an increase of the heat release rate compared to the steady state. Once the pocket reaches the ﬂame tip (at r → 0), all of the ﬂuid has been consumed and the heat release rate returns to the steady state value. This cor- 6.03 Physics Based Illustration of the Heat Release Dynamics responds to the ﬁnding made in Sec. 6.02 that ˙Q ′ is proportional to the integral of the instantaneous ﬂame front displacements. If we, ﬁnally, assume a W edge ﬂame, we have a situation as illustrated in Fig. 6.07 c. Position I now is at a small and III at a large radius. The initially created pocket, therefore, gathers more and more unburned ﬂuid while it is advected downstream. Due to mass conservation, this has to lead to a reduction of the global heat release rate compared to the steady state, since the ﬂame stores more and more premixture instead of burning it. This is exactly the inverse behavior of a Bunsen ﬂame and explains the negative sign of the integral in Eq. (6.012), which is positive for Bunsen ﬂames. When the growing pocket ultimately reaches the ﬂame tip, all of the gathered ﬂuid is burned all of a sudden, similarly to Slit ﬂames. The described behavior is now assessed analytically. Therefore, an unit impulse ve- locity forcing at the ﬂame baseu′ ⊥ = a δ(x F 1 )δ(t ) is assumed, which leads to an in- ﬁnitely thin pocket of unburned gas (see blue line/dot in Fig. 6.07) which is advected along the mean ﬂame front according to ξ ( x F 1, t ) = a u∥ δ ( t − x F u∥ ) (6.013) with the Dirac delta function δ(t ) and the geometry dependent amplitude a. All the volume of the impulsively supplied unburned ﬂuid Ve is now condensed to one point. The amplitude a is chosen such, that all of the extra volume ﬂux provided at the inlet of the domain (Index “ i ”) is displacing the ﬂame and hence is conserved:∫ A f a δ(x F 1 )d S = ∫ Ai u′ 1 d S. Therefore, we get a = Ri for Slit ﬂames, a = Ri /2 for Bun- sen Flame and a = Rr /2(1/ ˜r 2 − 1) for W edge ﬂames, with the non-dimensional rod radius ˜r = Rr /Ra. By integrating Eq. (1.032) ( l M = 0) and applying a ﬂame base move- ment as described above as a boundary condition, a transfer function connecting the normalized upstream velocity perturbationu′ 1 and the normalized ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuation is evaluated: Fδ(ω) = A′(ω)/ A u′ 1 (ω)/u 1 (6.014) The impulse responses resulting from this approach are provided in Appendix C.2 for all three geometries. Fδ(ω) can be viewed as an FTF where the velocity perturbation is imposed only at the ﬂame base. Therefore, it shares some basic properties with conventional FTFs, for example, that it has a low-frequency limit of unity. The resulting response functions are plotted for all three ﬂames in Fig. 6.08, on the left hand side in time domain (impulse responsehδ) and on the right in frequency domain in terms of gain and phase. All quantities are non-dimensionalized by the characteristic ﬂame time: h∗ δ = hδτr, t ∗ = t /τr and f ∗ = f τr. For W edge ﬂames, a non-dimensional rod ra- dius of ˜r = 0.05 is assumed. It should be noted that the IRs of the Slit and the W edge conﬁguration both contain a Dirac delta function.

For W edge ﬂames a non-dimensional rod radius of ˜r = 0.05 is assumed. is characterized by its integral and it is hence decided to plot this integral value in all IR visualizations. That means, for example, that the yellow square in Fig. 6.08 ( ) represents a 2δ(t ∗ − 1) contribution. The impulse response (IR) of the Slit ﬂame (, impulses as ) only consists of a Dirac impulse at t ∗ = 1, which is exactly the time it takes for a ﬂame front perturba- tion to be advected from the base to the tip. Since a very localized response in time domain leads to a very spread out response in frequency domain (and vice versa), the gain of Slit ﬂames is unity for all frequencies, see also T ab. C.2 in Appendix C.1. The phase linearly decays, as it is expected for systems with a single, constant time delay τr. A Bunsen ﬂame ( ) spreads the response in time, as it continuously burns the sup- plied pocket of ﬂuid. This leads to a constant positive value of the IR until t ∗ = 1, where the pocket has reached the ﬂame tip. Consequently, the gain of the associated frequency response (FR) drops to zero at that frequency whose period ﬁts the charac- teristic ﬂame time, which isf = 1/τr. Up to a Strouhal number of f ∗ = 1, the phase decays with a constant slope which corresponds to that of a system with a ﬁxed time delayτr /2. This delay is deﬁned by the geometrical center of the IR. At multiples of f ∗ = 1 the phase jumps by π since the gain drops to zero. The smearing of the heat release ﬂuctuation in time leads to a, compared to Slit ﬂames, reduced cut-off fre- 6.04 Incompressible-Convective FTF Models quency of the corresponding transfer function. Mathematically, this can be explained by the low-pass ﬁlter behavior of an integrator (∝ 1/ω). Finally, a W edge ﬂame (, impulses as ) increases the initially supplied pocket of fresh ﬂuid and, hence, shows a negative response in the time domain up to t ∗ = 1. At the time the pocket reaches the tip, all of the accumulated and excitation supplied premixture is burned at once and leads to a strong impulse att ∗ = 1. The magnitude of this impulse is higher than the one of the Slit ﬂame, since the ﬂuid pocket grew in size along its way to the ﬂame tip. Hence, W edge ﬂames have two intrinsic time scales, τr from the impulse and τr /2 from the integration. Through interference effects this leads to recurring peaks in the gain. In particular at high frequencies, the phase is dominated by the characteristic ﬂame timeτr. Using the example of a (inﬁnitely narrow) pocket of ﬂuid, which is advected from the ﬂame base to the tip, it was possible to intuitively conﬁrm the analytical results from Sec. 6.02. Further, some fundamental consequences of different ﬂame geometries on the ﬂame response in frequency and time domain could be illustrated. One example are the different time lags of Bunsen and Slit ﬂames (τr /2 vs. τr ), which lead to dif- ferent slopes in the transfer function phase. This is in accordance with the ﬁndings by Duchaineet al, which leads to the conclusion that even such a simple ﬂame response model as the one described here correctly predicts some features of realistic FTFs. In the next section we derive analytical predictions for the FTF for all conﬁgu- rations, using the most widespread velocity models from the literature, and compare the results to CFD/SI data, see Sec. 6.01, as well as to measurement data from the liter- ature. It will be shown that the respective results, although being more complex, will qualitatively be very similar to those retained by the aforementioned simple model. 6.04 Incompressible-Convective FTF Models Integration of Eq. (1.032) (l M = 0) requires a model for the ﬂame normal velocity perturbation u′ ⊥. State of the art models, which allow the analytical evaluation of the FTF, are based on axially advected ﬂow perturbations emanating from the ﬂame base, see Sec. 2.02.01 (Low-Order Models). The two most common ones are the “convective velocity model” and the “incompressible-convective velocity model”. The ﬂow ﬁeld of the former consists of axial ﬂow perturbations, which are transported with mean ﬂow velocity u 1 and lead to the generation of wrinkles at the momentary location of the perturbation along the ﬂame. The ﬂow ﬁeld of the latter introduces a matching lateral ﬂow perturbation to fulﬁll continuity equation. Using the Einstein summation convention, the incompressibility condition reads for Consequences of Flame Geometry symmetric conﬁgurations: Slit: Conical: ∂u′ i ∂xi = 0 ∂u′ i ∂x L i + u′ x L = 0 → u′ 2 = −x L ∂u′ ∂x L → u′ 2 = − x L ∂u′ ∂x L. A Cartesian and a cylindrical coordinate system is applied here for Slit and conical ﬂames, respectively. A general formulation that combines slit and conical cases reads u′ 2 = −x L 2 f g ∂u′ ∂x L, (6.015) where the geometrical factor f g is set to f g = 1 for slit and to f g = 1/2 for conical ﬂames. By setting f g = 0, the plain convective velocity model is recovered. As stated in Sec. 2.02.03, in order to derive an analytical expression for the FTF, either a harmonic or an unit impulse signal has to be imposed on the reference velocity po- sition. In the following the latter method is applied, the impulse response is evaluated and the frequency response is derived from that. In the time domain (unit impulse excitation), convective velocity models exhibit an advected Dirac velocity perturbationu′ 1 = δ ( t − x L 1 / u 1 ), which locally perturbs the ﬂame front, see Eq. (2.06). It is shown below that such a velocity model leads to the occurrence of Dirac impulses in the corresponding IRs of Slit and W edge ﬂames. This, in turn, results in frequency responses lacking a cut-off frequency, i. e. the as- sociated FTF does not feature the characteristic low-pass behavior. In order to rem- edy this unrealistic shortcoming, we assume a general velocity kernel functiong (τ), which determines a characteristic spatial shape of the convected velocity ﬂuctua- tionsu′ 1 = g (τ). In the convective model described above, this kernel is a Dirac delta function: g δ(τ) = δ(τ), with τ = t − x L 1 / u 1. A natural extension to this model is the assumption of a Gaussian kernel g σ(τ) = 1∝∇adicallow 2πσ2 exp ( − τ2 2σ2 ) (6.016) with the standard deviation σ. Applying such a kernel is effectively a low-pass ﬁlter- ing of the results computed from a Dirac kernel and, therefore, leads to the desired low-pass behavior of the FTFs. Furthermore, it allows for more realistic predictions of acoustically induced ﬂame front displacements as will be shown in Sec. 6.06. Employing the general kernel and applying Eq. (6.015), the two advected components 6.04 Incompressible-Convective FTF Models x L 1, ref x L 1[m] u′1/ 2 [m/s] Figure 6.09: Qualitative illustration of the velocity ﬁeld resulting from unit impulse forcing and a Gaussian velocity kernel functiong (τ) at position x L 1,ref. Shown are x L 1 ( ) and x L 2 ( ) components for a standard deviation of σ1, as well as x L 1 ( ) and x L 2 ( ) components for σ2 = 2σ1. of the velocity perturbation of Eq. (2.06) are written as u′ 1 = g ( t − x L K u 1 ) (6.017) u′ 2 = f g x L K u 1 g ′ ( t − x L K u 1 ), (6.018) with g ′(τ) denoting the ﬁrst derivative of the kernel function with respect to τ. Here, a parameter K is introduced, which deﬁnes the axial advection speed of the ve- locity perturbation as a multiple of the mean ﬂow velocity (inverse deﬁnition as in ). For K = 1 the standard convective velocity model is retrieved. Fig. 6.09 qualitatively shows the spatial shape of the x L 1 and x L 2 velocity components of the convected perturbation for a Gaussian velocity kernel function of two different standard deviationsσ. For σ → 0, the velocity perturbation becomes more and more localized as it approaches a Dirac impulse. From Fig. 6.09 it is deduced that the integral ofu′ 2 over x L 1 is zero. Indeed, the as- sociated velocity ﬁeld has a solenoidal character and thus corresponds to a vortical velocity ﬁeld. Fig. 6.010 exemplarily illustrates the qualitative two-dimensional (2 D) velocity (u′ 1,u′ 2 ) and vorticity ( ω′ 3) ﬁeld associated with the convective Gaussian dis- turbance for a Bunsen ﬂame. The axial velocity component u′ 1 provides fresh ﬂuid, which generates a positive displacement of the ﬂame front, while the u′ 2 component leads to positive as well as negative displacements of equal magnitude. From the ar- rows in Fig. 6.010 it becomes clear that theu′ 2 component redistributes ﬂame front deﬂections. When interpreting the shown velocity ﬁeld, it has to be kept in mind that Consequences of Flame Geometry Figure 6.010: Snapshot of the velocity and vorticity ﬁeld resulting from unit impulse response forcing and a Gaussian velocity kernel for a Bunsen ﬂame. Shown are the two velocity componentsu′ 1 (top left), u′ 2 (top right) and the correspond x L 3 vorticity component ω′ 3 (bottom), all of them normalized by their maximum absolute value. only the velocity right at the mean ﬂame front interacts with the ﬂame. The spatio- temporal structure far away from the ﬂame is not important and should, hence, not be misinterpreted as a strange kind of shear layer vortex. In order to derive analytical expressions for the IRs of all three conﬁgurations, we ﬁrstly evaluate the ﬂame normal velocity perturbation associated with Eqs. (6.017) and (6.018), which is u′ ⊥,Λ/slit =g [ t − x F L f τc ] sin(α) + f g τc Ri − x F 1 sin(α) L f g ′ [ t − x F L f τc ] (6.019) 6.05 Geometry-Dependent Analysis of the Incompressible-Convective Model for Slit and Bunsen ﬂames and u′ ⊥,V =g [ t − x F L f τc ] sin(α) + f g τc R 0 + x F 1 sin(α) L f g ′ [ t − x F L f τc ] (6.020) for W edge ﬂames. A second characteristic time τc is introduced here, which denotes the time it takes for an axially advected velocity perturbation to be transported from the ﬂame base to its tip. This introduces the velocity of the convective disturbance in ﬂame coordinatesuc, which is provided for both coordinate systems in T ab. 6.01. The characteristic ﬂame times τr and τc are related to ﬂame speed, the ﬂame angle and the feed duct half-diameter by τr = Ri s L cos(α), (6.021) τc = cos 2 (α) K τr, (6.022) where the relation cos 2 (α) = 1 − s 2 L /u 2 1 could be applied to estimate the ﬂame angle. For W edge ﬂames, a length Ri = Ra − Rr has to be used in Eq. (6.021). Using the de- scribed perturbation velocity ﬁeld, analytical expressions for the IRs of all three ﬂame geometries are derived by solving Eq. (1.032) (l M = 0) and, subsequently, Eq. (2.03) for the unit impulse response h(t ) using the ﬂame surface integrals summarized in T ab. 6.01. Results are provided in Appendix C.1 and are functions of τr and τc only (ignoring f g and possible kernel parameters). The FTF of W edge ﬂames has the non- dimensional rod radius ˜r = Rr /Ra as a third parameter. All FTFs are derived in terms of a general kernel g and are hence ready to be used with arbitrary functions. W e introduce the abbreviation DIC for the Dirac kernel based incompressible- convective velocity model and GIC for the Gaussian kernel based counterpart. The GIC model relies on the two additional empirical parameters K and σ, which need to be ﬁtted to experimental observations. As will be shown later, K is primarily used to modify the frequency of maximum gain and σ to set the cut-off frequency of the FTF. 6.05 Geometry-Dependent Analysis of the Incompressible- Convective Model Above, the incompressible-convective velocity models for three ﬂame conﬁgurations were introduced. W e now want to analyze the DIC model for all geometries in order to gain some insights into the respective ﬂame responses. T o date, expressions of the DIC model have solely been evaluated for Bunsen ﬂames.

The phase decay correspond- ing to a ﬁxed time delay of τr ( ) and the one corresponding to τr /2 ( ) are added to the phase plots. For W edge ﬂames a non- dimensional rod radius of ˜r = 0.05 is assumed. analyzed them in time and frequency domain, Preetham et al and Orchini and Juniper focused only on frequency domain representations. The following discussion seeks to close this gap in the literature. FTF predictions of the DIC model forα = π/4 and K = 1 are shown in Fig. 6.011 for all three ﬂame geometries. For W edge ﬂames, a non-dimensional rod radius of ˜r = 0.05 is assumed. The IRs are shown on the left-hand side of this ﬁgure and the associated FRs, in terms of magnitude and phase, on the right. All quantities are non-dimensionalized by the characteristic ﬂame time:h∗ = hτr, t ∗ = t /τr and f ∗ = f τr. The IRs of the Slit and the W edge ﬂame contain Dirac delta functions. This kind of function (strictly speaking distribution) is characterized by its integral and it is hence decided to indicate this integral value in all IR visualizations whenever a Dirac Impulse is present. That means, for example, that the blue circle in Fig. 6.011 represents a −δ(t ∗ − 1) contribution. Since the integral of this expression is −1, the circle indicates this value in the graphical representation of the IR at t ∗ = 1. The respective behavior of the FTF for the various geometries becomes more clear when analyzing the transient ﬂame front deﬂectionξ(x F 1, t ) caused by an impulse forcing. An illustration of a snapshot is shown in Fig. 6.012 a for Slit and Bunsen and in 6.05 Geometry-Dependent Analysis of the Incompressible-Convective Model (a) Bunsen and Slit ﬂames (b) W edge ﬂames Figure 6.012: Illustration of the displaced ﬂame front deﬂection ξ ( x F 1, t ) of the DIC model for an impulse velocity perturbation. Shown are two ﬂanks, which propagate with the velocityur (restoration) and uc (convective ﬂow disturbance), and two impulses I and II both propagating with the velocity of the respective ﬂank. Fig. 6.012 b for W edge ﬂames. As expound by Blumenthal et al for the plain con- vective velocity model, two ﬂanks are formed (see Fig. 6.012), which delimit a pocket of unburned gas. This pocket grows in extent, since the downstream ﬂank propagates with a higher velocity than the upstream one (uc > ur ). In case of the incompressible- convective velocity model, additionally, two ﬂame front displacements of the shape of a Dirac impulse are formed (see Fig. 6.012), which are not present in the plain con- vective velocity model and also propagate along the ﬂame front. They result from the lateral, solenoidal velocity component of the convected perturbation. In agreement with Fig. 6.012 we refer to those impulses as Impulse I and Impulse II. Their propa- gation speed equals the speed of the adjacent ﬂank, i. e.uc for impulse II and ur for impulse I. First let us consider a Bunsen ﬂame. Here, Impulse I forms a negative ﬂame front displacement and its amplitude stays constant while it is advected downstream with ur, see Fig. 6.012 a. Impulse II constitutes a positive displacement and its amplitude decreases when advected downstream by the velocity uc, until it reaches zero right at the ﬂame tip. According to Sec. 6.02, the linearized ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuation of a Bunsen ﬂame depends on the integral of the instantaneous ﬂame front deﬂections. Hence, advected Dirac impulses are transformed to Heaviside Step functions in time when evaluating the IR, see Appendix C.1. Consequently, the IR of a Bunsen ﬂames does not show any Dirac Impulses as depicted in Fig. 6.013 a. Impulse I adds a constant negative contribution to the overall IR ( ), while Impulse II adds an decreasing, positive value to the overall IR, which disappears at t ∗ = 0.05, i. e. in dimensional time at t = τc ( ). The speciﬁc nature of the Bunsen ﬂame heat-release dynamics (integral of ξ) leads to a dispersion of the ﬂame response in time. This, in turn, goes along with a relatively low cut-off frequency of the associated FTF, see Fig. 6.011 ( ). This can be explained by the fact that integration imposes a 1/ω behavior in Consequences of Flame Geometry 0 0. 5 1 − 1 t∗ [-] h∗ (a) Bunsen ﬂame 0 0. 5 1 − 1 t∗ [-] h∗ (b) Slit ﬂame 0 0. 5 1 − 2 − 1 t∗ [-] h∗ (c) W edge ﬂame Figure 6.013: Impulse responses of the three different ﬂame conﬁgurations.

Parameters are the same as those described in Fig. 6.011. frequency domain, see T ab. C.2 in Appendix C.1: The integral of a Dirac impulse is the Heaviside step function and, consequently, the amplitude of the one-sided Fourier transform of the latter shows an 1/ω behavior while it is unity for the former. The situation is very different when a Slit ﬂame is considered. The instantaneous ﬂame front displacement according to the DIC model is qualitatively the same as for a Bunsen ﬂame, see Fig. 6.012 a. However, since the ﬂame surface area ﬂuctuation of Slit ﬂames depends to leading order only on the ﬂame tip movement, see Sec. 6.02, Dirac impulses inξ lead to the appearance of Dirac impulses in the IR. More specif- ically, as shown in Fig. 6.013 b, Impulse I adds a negative Dirac impulse at t ∗ = 1 (in dimensional time at t = τr ). Impulse II has no impact as it vanishes at the ﬂame tip. The negative impulse at t ∗ = 1 leads to an FR gain tending to unity instead of zero for f → ∞, see Fig. 6.011 ( ). All in all, the response of a Slit ﬂame constitutes a time delayed, direct effect of ﬂame front perturbations. No spatial integration of ﬂame displacements, as in the Bunsen case, is present, which leads to an FR lacking a low-pass ﬁltering behavior. The global heat-release rate of Bunsen ﬂames responds to the integral of a ﬂame front perturbation, while Slit ﬂames react to ﬂame front deﬂections directly once they reach the ﬂame tip. Bunsen ﬂames are, in consequence, a more sedate source of sound than Slit ﬂames for a given ﬂame front perturbation. This fact might, besides other effect such as ﬂame curvature or burner-plenum acoustics, contribute to the lower sound pressure levels of combustion noise produced by turbulent Bunsen type ﬂames compared to Slit ones, as reported by Kotake and T akamoto and Pausch et al. 6.06 V alidation of Flame Response Models In terms of response characteristics, W edge ﬂames are in some aspects similar to Slit ﬂames and in others more close to Bunsen ﬂames. A snapshot of the resulting ﬂame front deﬂection due to an impulse velocity forcing is shown in Fig. 6.012 b. Again, two ﬂanks appear, which are advected downstream. Impulse I depends on the non- dimensional rod radius˜r and has a constant, non-zero value for ˜r > 0. Contrary to Bunsen and Slit ﬂames, Impulse II now increases in amplitude while it is advected downstream. Consequently, both impulses lead to the occurrence of Dirac impulses in the IR of W edge ﬂames, see Fig. 6.013 c. Thus, the gain of the corresponding FR never reaches zero and shows several recurring peaks of high magnitude, similar to a Slit conﬁguration, see Fig. 6.011 ( ). While the phase of a Slit ﬂame decays with a constant slope, which corresponds to the one of a system with a ﬁxed time delay τr, the phase of a Bunsen ﬂames decays with a slope corresponding to a time delay τr /2. The phase of a W edge ﬂame with α = π/4 behaves similar to the one of a Bunsen ﬂame, as depicted in Fig. 6.011. For longer ﬂames ( α ↓) the phase of a W edge ﬂame would approach the one of a Slit ﬂame (not shown). The response of W edge ﬂames integrates ﬂame front perturbationsand also directly responds to them once they reach the ﬂame tip. In that sense they are a hybrid of Slit and Bunsen ﬂames. Since, however, their ﬂame front deﬂection according to the DIC model is different to that of Bunsen and Slit ﬂames, see Fig. 6.012, they are not a pure hybrid and additionally bring some individual response characteristics, such as the presence of pronounced positive and negative contributions in their IR. As explicated by Blumenthalet al, this is a necessary condition for the occurrence of peak gain values exceeding unity. Indeed, the gain shown in Fig. 6.011 afﬁrms this statement. In this section it is illustrated that each of the three considered ﬂame conﬁgurations has its own peculiar response characteristics. As will be shown in the following, the incompressible-convective velocity model is able to predict frequency and impulse responses, which qualitatively and also quantitatively agree with CFD and experi- mental data, if a Gaussian instead of a Dirac kernel is used. In doing so, the Dirac impulses, appearing in the IRs of Slit and W edge ﬂames, are transformed to Gaussian impulses. This corresponds to a dispersion in time and, hence, to a decreased cut-off frequency, which brings the desired low-pass behavior of the predicted FTFs. 6.06 V alidation of Flame Response Models Figs. 6.014, 6.015 and 6.016 visualize FTFs identiﬁed from the CFD simulations in- troduced in Sec. 6.01 for all three ﬂame conﬁgurations ( ). Additionally, predic- tions from the convective and the incompressible-convective velocity model (DIC and GIC) are shown. The free parametersτr, τc and ˜r are computed according to Eqs. (6.021) and (6.022) using the physical and geometrical quantities introduced in Sec. 6.01 and a laminar ﬂame speed of s L = 0.0278 m/s.

(see e. g. ), we have to adjust τr for the Slit and the W edge setup compared to the results provided by Eq. (6.021) in order to match the CFD/SI data. This correction is applied by ﬁtting the reduced order models to the CFD/SI IR data such that the po- sition of the ﬁrst negative part of the IRs coincide. Conﬁnement effects are negligible for the Bunsen ﬂame setup. The respectively values ofτr are provided in the ﬁgure captions of the FTF data. Concerning the empirical parameters of the GIC model, for the Bunsen and the Slit results presented here, we choseσ = 1.02 ms and K = 1.03 in order to match the CFD data. For the W edge case, K = 1.03 could be applied as well, however, we use an in- creased standard deviation of σ = 1.09 ms. This results in a non-dimensionalized stan- dard deviation σ∗ = σ/τr of σ∗ ≈ 0.0064 for the Slit and Bunsen setup and σ∗ ≈ 0.0142 for W edge case. Hence, at least for the three cases discussed here, some universality of these parameter values can be assumed. By evaluating the FTF for both a Dirac and a Gaussian kernel, the importance of the dispersion in time, which was mentioned in Sec. 6.04, becomes apparent. W edge and Slit ﬂames have Dirac impulses in their DIC model based predictions, see (, impulses as ) in Figs. 6.014 and 6.016. The corresponding FR gain curves oscillate without decaying to zero, which does not reﬂect the observed low-pass ﬁltering be- havior of ﬂames.

IR become Gaussian impulses such that the gain of the associated FR shows a similar cut-off behavior as the CFD/SI data. Generally, very good agreement between the GIC model and the CFD/SI data is found for the three investigated conﬁgurations. It shall now be analyzed if the respective ﬂame front displacements also resemble the CFD data and how they are connected to speciﬁc features of the IR. For that purpose, it was decided to representatively analyze the Slit conﬁguration since the relation between the global heat-release rate and ﬂame displacements is very straight forward here. The respective data for the Bunsen and the W edge ﬂame are brieﬂy discussed afterwards. Fig. 6.017 compares the IR of a Slit ﬂame to its associated normalized ﬂame front displacementsξ/ ˆξ, one time for the CFD data ( ) and one time for the IC velocity model employing a Dirac (, impulses as ) and a Gaussian ( ) kernel. Here, the reference displacement is deﬁned as ˆξ = ∫ t 0 u′ 1 dt. The displacements of the CFD data are evaluated from a simulation that is excited by an impulse forcing of 10%u 1 amplitude. It was veriﬁed that the resulting global heat-release rate of this impulsively forced setup corresponds to the IR estimated from the broad-band data (not shown). Snapshots at four instants in timet 1 to t 4 of the displaced ﬂame front are plotted in Fig. 6.017 (lower half). The corresponding temporal positions are marked in the plot of the IR (upper half) by horizontal dashed lines.

Having a look at the corresponding GIC and DIC data, it is apparent that displace- ment amplitudes are overpredicted until they reach the ﬂame tip, where they match the CFD results reasonably well. Knowing that the global heat-release rate of Slit ﬂames depends solely on ﬂame tip movements, it becomes clear that the matching of amplitudes at the tip region is the crucial property that determines the quality of the associated IR prediction. Figs. 6.018 and 6.019 show the corresponding results for a Bunsen and W edge conﬁg- uration, respectively. Again it can bee seen that although ﬂame displacements pre- dicted by CFD and the GIC model do not perfectly match, the IRs of the global heat-release agree well. The GIC model is able to qualitatively capture the dynam- ics of an impulsively perturbed ﬂame front. For harmonic forcing Baillotet al reported good agreement between experiment and the DIC model in terms of ﬂame shapes. Since the GIC model improves response predictions compared to the DIC model, it can be conjectured that the GIC model should further improve that already good match. It is interesting to note that while Slit and Bunsen conﬁgurations exhibit ﬂame front displacements that grow in amplitude, the ones for W edge ﬂames show a decaying behavior (Fig. 6.019, ). The reason for this is unclear. Further, the initial displace- ments at t = 0 are very similar for all three conﬁgurations, which means that, qual- Consequences of Flame Geometry 0 0. 5 1 − 0. 5 0. 5 t 1 x F 1/L f [-] ξ/ ˆξ [-] 0 0. 5 1 t 2 x F 1/L f [-] 0 0. 5 1 t 3 x F 1/L f [-] 0 0. 5 1 t 4 x F 1/L f [-] 0 1 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t∗ [-] h∗ [-] Figure 6.019: Comparison of IR (top) and the corresponding normalized ﬂame front displacementξ/ ˆξ of the W edge conﬁguration resulting from an impulse forcing at four instants in time, shown for the CFD/SI data ( ) as well as for the incompressible-convective velocity model employing a Dirac (, impulses as ) and a Gaussian ( ) kernel, see also Fig. 6.016. Compare to Fig. 6.012 b for clariﬁcation. itatively, the results presented in Chap. 4 seem not to be limited to Slit ﬂames but are rather universal. Finally, the deviation of displacements of the DIC from the GIC model for Slit and W edge conﬁgurations illustrates the importance of the Gaussian impulses for the overall response characteristics. Comparing predictions of the ﬂame front displacements shown in Fig. 6.017 from the DIC (, impulses as ) and the GIC ( ) model, one realizes that the Gaussian kernel disperses unphysical, very localized Dirac displacements of the DIC model in space. Such a dispersion might be related to effects of ﬂame stretch, particularly curvature, as well as to the ﬁnite width of the initial ﬂame displacements of the CFD data att 1, which is an essentially inviscid effect. As a consequence of the oscillatory displaced ﬂame front, Slit ﬂames show a decay- ing oscillatory IR with alternating positive and negative contributions of decreasing amplitude, see Figs. 6.014 and 6.017. The GIC model captures the ﬁrst period of this signal and then immediately decays to zero. The negative part of the predicted IR is caused by theu′ 2 component of the velocity model, see Eq. (6.018), which corresponds to a vortical velocity ﬁeld, as described in Sec. 6.04. It is hence deduced that, In the proposed models, the ﬁrst negative minimum (the second for W edge ﬂames) of all IRs is caused by vortical structures. Slit ﬂames show a very high peak gain value, which is not at all predicted by the plain convective velocity model, see Fig. 6.014 ( ). For the other two geometries, this model agrees reasonably well with the CFD/SI data. It correctly predicts the cut- off behavior of Bunsen ﬂames and only misses to capture the reoccurring maxima in the gain forf ∗ > 1.05, as depicted in Fig. 6.015. For W edge ﬂames, Fig. 6.016 shows that the gain exceeding unity at f ∗ ≈ 1.03 is qualitatively captured, however, the maximum 6.06 V alidation of Flame Response Models gain value is underestimated. The most important feature added by the DIC model, compared to the convective one, is the occurrence of impulses in the IR ( ). Slit ﬂames show one negative impulse at t ∗ = 1, right at the position of the ﬁrst minimum of the IR. W edge ﬂames have two of them, a negative one at t ∗ = 1 and a positive one at t ∗ = τc /τr, both at positions of local extreme values of the IR. Having a closer look at the IRs, it is found that the time scale deﬁned by τr − τc plays an important role. As already pointed out by Blumenthal et al, the difference between the restorative and the convective time deﬁnes the frequency of maximum gain for (sharp) W edge ﬂames. The IRs of all three ﬂame conﬁgurations show oscil- lations of decaying amplitude. They are most prominent for the Slit and the W edge conﬁguration, see Figs. 6.014 and 6.016. The width of half a period of these oscillations very well agrees with the timeτr − τc. The corresponding oscillation frequency is approximated by a Strouhal number f ∗ O = τr 2(τr − τc ) = 1 ( 1 − cos 2 (α) K ), (6.023) which is f ∗ O ≈ 1.07 for all shown cases. Around this frequency the Slit and the Bunsen ﬂame show a local maximum in the gain of their FR. The peak value of the W edge ﬂame is shifted to a lower Strouhal number of about 1.01. As stated by Eq. (6.023), the frequency of maximum gain depends on K and, hence, provides a physically motivated criterion to estimate this parameter. It is therefore presumed that the width of the Gaussian kernel function, set by the standard devi- ationσ, determines the cut-off frequency of the FTF and the parameter K ﬁxes the frequency of maximum gain. Physically, the value of the ﬁrst might be connected to diffusive processes and the one of the latter to (baroclinic) generation of vorticity. This ﬁnding is exploited in order to compare the proposed models to data from the literature. Since W edge setups comparable to the ones described here could not be found (i. e. no swirl and no inﬂuence of vortex shedding), only Bunsen and Slit con- ﬁgurations are used. Information about the experimental data is provided in T ab. 6.02. Fig. 6.020 shows the adopted frequency responses (FR), as well as the ﬁtted FTF pre- dictions of the GIC models. For each data set, a frequency is identiﬁed where the gain has a local maximum and Eq. (6.023) is used to compute an associated value for K. The values of cos 2 (α), which is according to Eq. (6.022) required to compute τc, and τr are estimated from the cited references. The standard deviation σ is then ad- justed until the cut-off frequency of the GIC model agrees sufﬁciently well with the experimental data. All ﬁt parameters are provided in T ab. 6.02. Since all Bunsen setups show a very similar trend, only one single model (f ∗ O ≈ 1.085) was ﬁtted. On the contrary, the FR of Slit ﬂames has a high variance and is strongly affected byτr : the maximum gain value and the cut-off frequency rise with increas- ing τr. Accordingly, the non-dimensional frequency f ∗ O shifts from 0.09 over 2.04 to 4.04. Since the GIC model consistently overpredicts the gain for low frequencies, it is Consequences of Flame Geometry Source Fit Parameter τr Fig. 6.020 Bunsen (Fig. 3.06, 2 m/s) K = 1.033 σ = 1.02 ms cos 2 (α) = 0.097 14.08 ms (Fig. 3.08) – 26.01 ms (Fig. 6.012, 0.0396 g/s) – 31.07 ms Slit (Fig. 7, T 50 h) K = 2.01 σ = 1.045 ms cos 2 (α) = 0.095 12.050 ms (CBB) K = 1.018 σ = 1.09 ms cos 2 (α) = 0.094 38.03 ms (UBB) K = 1.004 σ = 1.09 ms cos 2 (α) = 0.092 46.06 ms T able 6.02: Summary of experimental data adopted from the literature, see Fig. 6.020. 0. 5 Magnitude 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 -8π -4π f∗ [-] Phase (a) Bunsen Magnitude 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 -18π -12π -6π f∗ [-] Phase (b) Slit Figure 6.020: Experimental frequency response data of selected conical (a) and a slit ﬂames (b) adopted from the literature (see T ab. 6.02).

Besides this, it is able to capture both gain and phase sufﬁciently well. This is remarkable considering the fact that in particular for Slit ﬂames, the convective as well as the DIC model lead to very inaccurate FTF predictions, see also Fig. 6.014. Finally, it should be pointed out that the phase of all Bunsen FTFs coincides with the one of a system with a constant time delayτr /2, while Slit ﬂames resemble a system of time delay τr, see Fig. 6.020. This result corresponds to the ﬁndings of Duchaine 6.07 Summary and Conclusions et al and is captured correctly by both of the convective velocity models (DIC and GIC), see Sec. 6.05. 6.07 Summary and Conclusions This chapter analyzed the consequences of ﬂame geometry for the linear ﬂame re- sponse, namely the ﬂame transfer function (FTF). This was done by following a well established, G-equation based modeling approach and analyzing it with respect to geometry-related differences of Slit, Bunsen and W edge type ﬂame conﬁgurations. The process of how a wrinkled ﬂame front leads to ﬂuctuations in the global heat- release was identiﬁed as the key mechanism, which distinguishes the response of each ﬂame. Therefore, the ﬂame surface integral was analyzed in detail and analyt- ical expressions for stifﬂy anchored, symmetric ﬂames were derived. By extending the well-known incompressible-convective velocity model with a Gaussian Kernel, analytical FTF expressions were derived, which very well coincide with FTF predic- tions from numerical simulations for all three considered ﬂame conﬁgurations. The derived models rely on two empirical parameters, namely the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel and the advection velocity of the convective ﬂow perturbation relative to the mean ﬂow velocity. By relating the latter parameter to the frequency of maximum gain and the ﬁrst to the cut-off frequency of the FTF, it was possible to provide good predictions of gain and phase of experimentally determined FTFs taken from the literature. The main ﬁnding of the present analysis are: 1. The integral heat-release of Bunsen ﬂames is proportional to the integral of the ﬂame front displacement, the ﬂame tip movement is negligible. Consequently, heat-release rate ﬂuctuations induced by a displaced ﬂame front are dispersed in time, which leads to a relatively low cut-off frequency, such that the FTFs of Bunsen ﬂames look always quite similar when plotted over Strouhal number. The phase of the FTF is dominated by half the time of restorationτr /2. 2. The integral heat-release of Slit ﬂames is proportional to the ﬂame tip move- ment. Therefore, ﬂame front displacements directly affect the heat-release rate once they reach the tip. Compared to Bunsen ﬂames, this leads to an increased cut-off frequency and, hence, to a higher response variance of Slit ﬂame setups. Slit frequency responses show a high maximum gain value, which increases with the time of restorationτr. The heat-release of Slit ﬂames responds time delayed to ﬂame front perturbations, which leads to an FTF phase dominated by the characteristic ﬂame time of restorationτr. 3. The integral heat-release of W edge ﬂames is proportional to the ﬂame tip movement and the integral of the ﬂame front displacement. Their impulse re- sponse shows signiﬁcant positive and negative parts, which lead to gain values Consequences of Flame Geometry exceeding unity. The phase behaves similar to the phase of a Bunsen ﬂame and approaches the behavior of a Slit ﬂame for long ﬂames. 4. The impulse responses of all ﬂame conﬁgurations, identiﬁed from CFD data, show a strongly damped oscillatory behavior, which leads to a local maximum in the FTF gain close to the oscillation frequency. In the proposed modeling framework, this frequency could be related to the difference in the time of restoration and the one of distortion,τr − τc. This dependency can be exploited in order to compute the two empirical parameters of the proposed Gaussian incompressible-convective (GIC) velocity model. 5. For surface integration, it is important to choose a coordinate system that ac- counts for the possible ﬂame movements at the boundaries. Otherwise, variable integration limits are required. Based on these results, the ﬁndings of Part II, which are based on Slit ﬂames, can be transferred to Bunsen and W edge geometries. Since the ﬂame sheet dynamics essen- tially remains the same for all discussed conﬁgurations, differences emerge mainly from how ﬂame shape translates to heat release. These integrals could simply be im- plemented into the low-order modeling framework suggested in Part II, which would allow for an approximation of the respective response characteristics. Summary and Conclusions This doctoral thesis analyzed the linear acoustic response of laminar premixed Bunsen-type ﬂames primarily relying on ﬁrst-principle-based, low-order modeling approaches. A literature review on the dynamics of laminar ﬂames and interactions between acoustics and burner-stabilized ﬂames laid the foundation for all subse- quently performed investigations and provided guidance for the identiﬁcation of rele- vant physical mechanisms determining the response characteristics. While, in the lit- erature, the understanding of the dynamics of burner-stabilized ﬂames whose anchor- ing is mechanically displaced, is based on the concepts of the Darrieus-Landau insta- bility and thermal-diffusive mechanisms, the interpretation evolves around the notion of convected velocity perturbations in the case of acoustically perturbed ﬂames. This is particularly surprising knowing that their dynamics should in fact be very similar, since acoustics predominately displaces the ﬂame base region in both cases. Motivated by this realization, a ﬁrst principles-based incompressible low-order mod- eling framework was introduced, relying on methods adopted from aero-acoustics: the ﬂow ﬁeld is represented by a number of ﬂow-ﬁeld singularities combined with a conformal mapping technique and a Kutta condition. In a ﬁrst step, ﬂame-ﬂow feedback was neglected and primary acoustics-ﬂame interactions were assessed. It was found that consequences of shed vorticity for the ﬂame response are negligible and that the irrotational part of the acoustic perturbations displaces essentially the ﬂame base region. Hence, convective sources of ﬂame displacement, as assumed by state-of-the-art low-order modeling approaches in the limit of negligible ﬂame-ﬂow feedback, could not be identiﬁed. Comparing low-order predictions to high ﬁdelity CFD data, it could be shown that the resulting ﬂame front displacements match only well right at the moment when the acoustic impulse hits the ﬂame. At later times, secondary mechanisms come into play, causing secondary displace- ments as well as the convective growth of displacement amplitudes. These effects could be associated with ﬂame-ﬂow feedback which essentially has two contribu- tions: (i) a vortical one relying on ﬂame-generated vorticity and (ii) an irrotational one relying on a ﬂame-normal acceleration of the ﬂow across a ﬂame sheet together with a ﬂame displacement-induced geometrical focusing. While the former mecha- nism causes a perturbed ﬂame sheet to behave like a vortex sheet of varying strength, the far ﬁeld of the latter resembles the one of advected dipoles. The upstream in- Consequences of Flame Geometry ﬂuence of each of these two mechanisms onto the unburned ﬂow induces convected velocity perturbations. This explains observations reported by previous experimental studies. Concerning the linear response of the global heat release, it could be shown that both mechanisms of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback lead to the occurrence of peak FTF gain values signiﬁcantly exceeding unity. All those investigations were performed for Slit ﬂame conﬁgurations; the literature, however, mostly reports on Bunsen ﬂames. Therefore, in the ﬁnal part of this thesis, consequences of ﬂame geometry — namely of Slit, Bunsen and W edge conﬁgurations — for the acoustic response were analyzed. It was found that the process of how a wrinkled ﬂame front leads to ﬂuctuations in the global heat-release constitutes the key mechanism that distinguishes the responses of different ﬂame geometries. By extending the well-known incompressible-convective velocity model with a Gaussian Kernel, analytical FTF expressions were derived, which coincide very well with FTF predictions from numerical simulations for all three considered ﬂame geometries. The main achievements of this work can be summarized to: • The linear thermoacoustic response (FTF) of a laminar premixed ﬂame is essentially governed by hydrodynamic mechanisms that lead to (i) primary acoustically induced perturbations acting predominantly at the ﬂame base and (ii) ﬂame-ﬂow feedback interacting with these primary ﬂame front displace- ments while they are convected downstream. • Flame-ﬂow feedback has vortical and irrotational contributions and is respon- sible for FTF peak gain values signiﬁcantly exceeding unity. Further it explains the observations of convected velocity perturbations upstream a wrinkled ﬂame sheet. • G-equation-based low-order models are usually based on the ad hoc assump- tion of convected velocity perturbations. They only implicitly include con- sequences of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback and, thus, do not faithfully represent the causality of the underlying ﬂow physics. • Flame geometry signiﬁcantly impacts the dynamics of the global heat release rate, while the respective ﬂame sheet dynamics remains essentially unchanged. Each geometry has its own unique response characteristics. Based on the analysis performed in this thesis, some questions still remain open and, additionally, some new issues have been raised. One important point that requires further investigations concerns the quantitative analysis of ﬂame-ﬂow feedback: It is still unclear whether the irrotational or the vortical component is more important, although the computed data suggests the former. Furthermore, the prevailing mech- anisms that impose a damping of ﬂame front perturbations and their respective con- sequences for the ﬂame response still need to be assessed. Based on these results, the introduced low-order modeling framework could then possibly be extended such 6.07 Summary and Conclusions that it allows for quantitative FTF predictions. Another point of interest concerns the observed oscillatory behavior of the impulse response of the global heat release rate. It would be of high value to explain the underlying mechanism in detail and pro- vide an estimate of the oscillation frequency. This is of particular interest knowing that this frequency is closely related to the frequency where the FTF gain exhibits its maximum. A detailed analysis of the ﬂame anchoring dynamics might assist these efforts. From a global point of view, the main outcome of this thesis is that modeling of the ﬂame response in a thermoacoustic context should be driven by ﬁrst-principle based analyses in future studies. It was shown in this work that one of the currently most wide-spread low-order models, the so-called convective velocity model, relies at its core on an ad hoc hypothesis that does not faithfully respect causality. While this may be acceptable for preliminary and academic studies on the global thermoacous- tic behavior of a system, it prevents detailed analyses of acoustic-ﬂame interactions. Particularly the ﬂame-ﬂow feedback driven high gains of the ﬂame transfer function found for Slit ﬂames provide strong hints that a more rigorous analysis would also be of high technical relevance. Furthermore, knowing that the ﬂame is the main source of non-linearity in thermoacoustic systems, improved ﬂame models would allow to compute amplitudes of non-linear self-sustained oscillations and thereby would en- able more detailed stability predictions of combustors. The theoretical fundamentals required to this end have already been laid in other ﬁelds of research. A ﬁrst step was conducted in this work to bring this knowledge into the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics. Consequences of Flame Geometry Appendices A Numerical Response Analysis Throughout this work numerical data is used for validation purposes or to provide guidance on identiﬁcation of the essential underlying physical mechanisms regard- ing acoustics-ﬂame interactions. This high-ﬁdelity data is computed using numerical simulations employing a 2-step chemical reaction scheme combined with means of system identiﬁcation. In order to efﬁciently extract information from this numerical simulations, various forcing signals and post-processing methods are applied. Details on all of these points are provided in the following. First of all, Sec. A.1 introduces the setups of the analyzed ﬂame conﬁgurations. Then, Sec. A.2 outlines the applied CFD/SI method using illustrative and representative ex- amples. An excursion on the various different ways of representing and analyzing the linear ﬂame response, with special focus on causality, will be provided in Sec. A.3. Finally, it is described in Sec. A.4 how ﬂame front displacements are computed from CFD ﬁeld data, which is speciﬁcally important for post-processing simulations of impulsively perturbed ﬂames. A.1 T est Case Setups In this thesis, premixed laminar premixed ﬂames, as sketched in Fig. 2.01, are investi- gated. In order to reduce complexity, only lean methane-air ﬂames of an equivalence ratio ofφ = 0.08 are considered, which all have Lewis numbers of approximately unity and an expansion ratio of e ≈ 6.07. All assessed ﬂame conﬁgurations are anchored by a separation induced low-speed region. Considering conﬁned ﬂames, all setups can — based on their cross-sectional view — be idealized as backward-facing step com- bustors, see Fig. A.1. A length Ri deﬁnes the half-width of the inlet or feed duct and a length Ra the half-width of the combustion chamber. For axisymmetric (conical) con- ﬁgurations, these two lengths deﬁne the respective radii. For W edge conﬁgurations, additionally, a central rod of radius Rr is added. A stream of fresh premixed reac- tants enters the domain at a bulk ﬂow velocity u 1, temperature Ti n = 300 K, ambient pressure and equivalence ratio φ. Depending on the temperature boundary as well as the initial condition, either a W edge or a Bunsen ﬂame establishes. In order to reduce complexity, all walls are assumed to be adiabatic. There are two exceptions: (1) the walls of the feed duct, which are set to a temperature of TF = 300 K in order to avoid a ﬂushing back of the Numerical Response Analysis Figure A.1: Cross-sectional view of the considered idealized combustor geometry. ﬂame and (2) the back-plate of the combustion chamber (rod face plate for wedge ﬂames), which is set to a temperature TBP that allows to established different anchor- ing conditions. Details on the numerical setup as well as the identiﬁcation process are speciﬁed in the following. A.2 CFD/SI Method CFD simulations of laminar ﬂames of different conﬁgurations are performed and their respective linear response behavior in terms of their FTF is identiﬁed. So-called ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) models are trained from broad band input/output CFD data, which are shown to capture the dynamics very well. The applied procedure combines means of system identiﬁcation (SI) with CFD simulation and is thus known in the literature as the CFD/SI approach, see e. g. Polifke. It will be explained in the following. Sec. A.2.01 introduces the numerical setup and settings used for all CFD simulations. Details on the identiﬁcation process relying on transient numerical data can be found in Sec. A.2.02. Finally, Sec. A.2.03 provides an overview on methods that allow to assess the goodness of the identiﬁed models. Representative example cases are used in order to illustrate the outlined proceeding. A.2.01 Incompressible Numerical Simulations Numerical simulations employing well established means of computational ﬂuid dy- namics (CFD) of all ﬂame conﬁgurations, are performed. In each case, a perfectly premixed laminar methane-air ﬂame of ﬁxed equivalence ratio is stabilized at a sud- den expansion of a duct, which connects the feed duct to the combustion chamber. All setups are chosen to be as simple as possible, in order to serve as a clean refer- ence. Further, the mechanisms governing the ﬂame response to acoustic perturbations should be similar for all cases, i. e. negligible interaction with vortical structures shed A.2 CFD/SI Method from the burner mouth for the W edge conﬁguration. Here, this shed- ding process is suppressed by adding a straight lateral wall constraining the ﬂame, see Fig. 6.01 b. All setups can be considered to be acoustically compact up to the respective cut-off frequency of the FTF. Since such ﬂames hardly respond to acoustic pressure ﬂuctu- ations, their acoustic response can numerically be evaluated by imposing (upstream) velocity perturbations applying an incompressible (low-Mach number) method, see e. g. In doing so, possible thermoacoustic instabilities are avoided and bound- ary conditions are simpliﬁed. The open source software Open FOAM is em- ployed. Chemical reactions are respected by adopting the reduced chemical kinetic 2-step mechanism (2 S-CM 2) proposed by Bibrzyckiet al. Schmidt numbers for all six considered species are set according to Duchaine et al. This solver setup has been used successfully in previous studies for transient and steady state sim- ulations. A 2 D uniform structured rectangular grid with a cell density of 40 cells/mm 2 and a slight increase of the axial cell width towards the boundaries after the ﬂame region is adopted for all cases. Steady state solutions for three exemplary setups are shown in Fig. 6.01. The color denotes absolute velocity and the region of maximum heat release is plotted in green. Additionally, the analytically predicted mean ﬂame front (see Sec. 2.02.01) is included ( ). For all setups, the steady state solutions show an accelerating ﬂow with a separating shear layer. Flow velocities of the burned gases are highest for the W edge and lowest for the Bunsen case. Also, the shear layer is least pronounced for the W edge case compared to the two other setups. A.2.02 System Identiﬁcation In the following it is explained how a ﬂame response model is ﬁtted to transient CFD input/output data such that it represents the underlying linear dynamics. For this purpose, a black-box approach is chosen. The resulting model is then used to evaluate and analyze the respective impulse and frequency responses of the simulated ﬂames. All means of system identiﬁcation described below are explicated in much more detail in the books by Ljung, Keesman or T angirala. In a ﬁrst step, a model structure has to be chosen that adequately represents the sys- tem of interest. Hence, the investigated ﬂame system needs to be characterized. In doing so, it can be constituted that the structure and parameters of all considered combustors usually do not vary over time and are, therefore,time invariant. Further- more, since the desired ﬂame model is used in a network model in order to assess linear stability, it has to be inherentlylinear. Conceptually, the input and output of a the ﬂame response is constructed such that its transfer behavior reﬂects causal- ity, i. e. that all outputs only depend on past and present inputs. The idea of a ﬂame transfer function (FTF) representing a ﬂame in an acoustic network model usually as- Numerical Response Analysis Figure A.2: Assumed model structure of the ﬂame system: An input signal u is mapped to an output y by the system F. The measured output ym is additionally inﬂuenced by white noise e. sumes bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the ﬂame element, see e. g. Subramanian et al. Finally, the response of an impulsively perturbed ﬂame is assumed to decay quickly, which is equivalent to the assumption of a high damping rate. For these reasons, a causal and BIBO stable linear time invariant (L TI) model structure is required. As depicted in Fig. A.2, such systems – in the following denoted as F – are assumed to transform an input signal u to an output signal y. The measured signal ym that constitutes the available output time series data is then the superposition of the de- terministic system outputy and an erratic signal e, which is in a ﬁrst approximation assumed to exhibit white noise characteristics. The ratio of the power of the signals y and e is called the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and determines the available infor- mation in the output data: A signal ym,1 whose SNR is higher than that of a signal ym,2 contains more information 1 for a given signal length, which allows for identiﬁ- cation of less ambiguous input-output models. It should be mentioned that the detailed characteristics of the erratic signale (white or colored noise) is not impor- tant for the ﬂame setups considered here due to the obtained very high SNR for all conducted simulations, which is a consequence of the prevailing laminar conditions. That means,e can be neglected and, to good approximation, a relation ym ≈ y holds. All system properties of F described above are met by a so-called ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) model. It is discrete in time and relates the in- and output signals by convolution of the inputu with an impulse response h y [n] = h 0 u[n] + h 1 u[n − 1] + ··· +h N u[n − N ] = N∑ i =0 hi u[n − i ]. (A.1) Here, y [n] denotes the input signal at a time step n ∈ N and hi the i -th impulse re- sponse coefﬁcient. Such a model consists of N + 1 ﬁnite valued coefﬁcients hi and is, consequently, inherently BIBO stable since ∑ ∞ k=0 |hk | < ∞holds. Causality is reﬂected by the fact that hi ≡ 0, ∀i < 0, which explains why the sum in Eq. (A.1) only starts at i = 0. FIR models are a subset of L TI models, since their output is computed by the convolution of an impulse response with an input signal, which is a linear op- eration. The frequency response associated with a given FIR model is computed from 1 White noise, as one limiting case, does not contain any information A.2 CFD/SI Method Figure A.3: Illustration of the CFD/SI approach applied to identify a FIR model us- ing broad band input/output CFD data. The “∗”-operator denotes tem- poral convolution. the z -transform of the impulse response F (ω) = N∑ i =0 hi exp (−iωi ∆t ) (A.2) with the imaginary unit i (not to confuse with the summation index i ), the sampling time of the FIR coefﬁcients ∆t and the real valued angular frequency ω. One known general disadvantage of FIR models is the high number of coefﬁcients, which have to be identiﬁed, particularly for weakly damped systems having a pole close to the unit circle. However, as stated above, all ﬂames show sufﬁcient damping such that the available time series data allows for good estimates of all required FIR coefﬁcients. FIR models are fairly robust against noisee, more specif- ically, Gaussian white noise of zero mean. For systems with a rather low SNR that are exposed to non Gaussian white noise or for systems that are less damped, other model structures, such as ARX or Box-Jenkins type models, have to be applied, see for example. All in all, FIR models fulﬁll all demanded requirements of an appropriate model structure and are, thus, an appropriate choice for the type of systems encountered in this thesis. Determining the FIR coefﬁcientshi based on available data is referred to as the actual process of system identiﬁcation. The associated process is illustrated in Fig. A.3: In a ﬁrst step, transient CFD simulations are performed, where the inlet velocity is excited around its mean, i. e.u 1 (t ) = u 1 + u′ 1 (t ). The amplitude of these ﬂuctuations is set to 2 − 5% of the mean velocity in order to not trigger non-linear effects but, at the same time, to achieve an adequate SNR. The input signal u ( ) used for identiﬁcation is the normalized velocity ﬂuctuation at the domain inlet u′ 1 (t )/u 1 and the output signal ym the normalized heat release rate ﬂuctuation ˙Q ′/ ˙Q integrated over the whole domain ( ). Feeding the FIR model with the same input data as the CFD simulation results in a model output ˜y ( ) according to Eq. (A.1). Now, those values of the FIR coefﬁcients hi are searched, which minimize the quadratic Numerical Response Analysis error between the CFD output time series ym ( ) and the model output ˜y ( ), formally written as ˆθ = arg min θ M M∑ j =1 ( ym [ j ] − ˜y [ j |θ ] )2, (A.3) where ˆθ = hi denotes the solution vector containing all FIR coefﬁcients. Hence, com- putation of the optimal parameters ˆθ requires the solution of a linear least squares problem and, therefore, it has to be ensured that the number of sampling instants M is signiﬁcantly higher than the number of FIR coefﬁcients N + 1. For such linear models, the predicted model output can be written in terms of a multiplication of an input matrixΦ and the solution vector ˜y = Φ ˆθ. Using this deﬁnition, the linear least squares problem formulated above leads to a set of linear equations whose solution is the desired optimal parameter vectorˆθ: ΦT Φ ˆθ = ΦT ym. (A.4) Essentially, four free parameters exist that determine the quality of the resulting ﬁt: (1) The type of input signalu, (2) the length of the input/output time series, (3) the number of FIR coefﬁcients N + 1 and (4) the sampling interval of the IR ∆t. These points are discussed one after another in the following. In order to ensure identiﬁability, the system input needs to excite all frequencies of interest. Otherwise, the information available in the input/output data is not sufﬁcient for identifying a response model. For example, if the input time series data resem- bles a sine of only one distinct frequency, no information about the response to other frequencies is available in the input/output data set. In order to obtain infor- mation on as many frequencies as possible at reasonable computational costs, it has been shown to be advantageous to use a broad band input signal that excites several frequencies at once. The lower bound of the frequency content of such a signal is limited by the length of the signal and the upper bound by the sam- pling time (Nyquist frequency). Practically, the upper bound has to be set well beyond the expected cut-off frequency of the FTF. Decreasing the lower bound is expensive, since longer time series data requires longer simulations. One way of improving the low-frequency accuracy atω → 0 is to use a step input signal: The new steady state that develops after the input velocity has been rapidly increased (step forcing) deﬁnes the zero frequency response at very high accuracy (neglecting noise). In the case of perfectly premixed ﬂames its value is unity. All models shown in this thesis are identiﬁed by use of a broad band input signal as proposed by Föller and Polifke and correctly capture this low frequency behavior. Determining the optimal number of FIR coefﬁcients N + 1 and sampling time ∆t for a given setup, is an iterative and rather intuitive process. The goal is to use as few coefﬁcients as possible by, at the same time, retaining a good representation of the system behavior. This avoids overﬁtting and reduces the required time series A.2 CFD/SI Method length, since only a minimal number of parameters need to be estimated. A heuristic approach to ﬁnding these two parameters starts with a small number of coefﬁcients and a sampling time that is related to a characteristic time of the ﬂame, which could be the time of restorationτr. A reasonable initial guess would be to use N + 1 = 15 coefﬁcients that are separated by a sampling time of ∆t = 2τr /N, since the expected IR is known to have a length of the order of τr. For this speciﬁc choice of parameters, the goodness of the resulting ﬁt has to be evaluated and based on that, N and ∆t have to be adjusted. This has to be repeated until a satisfactory model is retained. Although, in principle, it might be possible to develop an algorithm that manages this iterative process, two points should be kept in mind: (1) Similar ﬂames require similar parameters and (2) ﬁnding an adequate model is a rather fast process since estimation of the ﬁt parameters is computationally relatively cheap and only two free parameters are available. Hence, due to efﬁciency, the author decided to rather rely on his intuition than to develop an algorithm. Efﬁciently adjusting the two FIR parameters requires some basic understanding of the physics as well as the identiﬁcation process. T ools that allow to judge the goodness of a speciﬁc ﬁt are discussed in the following. A.2.03 Goodness of the Identiﬁed Model While – as shown above – the process of determining the optimal set of FIR parame- ters N and ∆t is a rather intuitive and iterative process, assessment of the goodness of the results follows well-deﬁned processes. Several established methods exist, which are introduced in the following. Representative examples from the ﬂame response data presented in this chapter are provided for the sake of illustration. Generally, a good ﬁt captures all of the deterministic part ofym that depends (here: linearly) on the input u and ﬁlters out the noise e. Given a speciﬁc data set, it shall provide the corresponding parameter vector ˆθ that represents most likely the real sys- tem behavior. At the same time, overﬁtting the given data set, i. e. capturing features by the deterministic model that rely on probabilistic processes, shall be avoided 1. In this thesis, three points are checked: 1. Check of plausibility 2. Quantiﬁcation of the uncertainties of the parameter vectorˆθ 3. Quantiﬁcation of how well the deterministic linear process is captured by the ﬁtted model 4. Demonstration that the model does not suffer from overﬁtting 1 In a low-noise environment overﬁtting is not a severe problem, nevertheless, it should be kept in mind.

Shown are the identiﬁed FIR coefﬁcient ( ) that are connected by lines ( ) and the associated 3σ conﬁdence intervals (gray area, framed by ). All of them are discussed in the following. Plausibility First of all, prior knowledge of the expected response model should be exploited. That is, the resulting transfer function can, e. g. be compared to available low-order models in terms of cut-off frequency, low frequency limit (should be unity), excess of gain or phase decay. Furthermore, characteristics of the IR, such as the time delay or the overall shape (decay to zero, rather smooth), can be checked. Fig. A.4 shows the FIR coefﬁcients resulting from identiﬁcation of a Slit and a Bun- sen ﬂame conﬁguration. Both are smooth functions of timet ∗ and their character- istics compare well to reduced order model predictions (see Chap. 6). Evaluation of the associated frequency response would result in a low-frequency limit of unity (not shown) and the IR decays to zero after a time that is of the order ofτr. Hence, the result shown can be considered to plausibly represent the system dynamics. Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation Conﬁdence intervals of the parameter vectorˆθ can be constructed that allow to quan- tify the uncertainties of the ﬁt with respect to the length and the SNR of the underly- ing time series data. The shorter the available time series and the higher the SNR, the less information is contained in a given data set, which will result in a more uncertain identiﬁcation of the parameter vectorˆθ. While experimental data suffers essentially from rather low SNRs, the critical issue for CFD is the length of the available time A.2 CFD/SI Method series data, since transient CFD simulations usually require a signiﬁcant amount of computational resources. For all performed simulations of laminar ﬂames, the SNR is very high and time series of a length of about 10τr have been proven to be sufﬁcient. In order to quantify uncertainties resulting from noisy ﬁnite length time series data, the covariance matrix of the identiﬁed model parameters is employed: Cov ( ˆθ ) =        σ2 00 σ2 01 ··· σ2 0 N σ2 10 σ2. σ2 N 0 ··· σ2 N N        (A.5) where σ2 i j= E [( ˆθi − θi ) (ˆθj − θj )] denotes the covariance of two parameters ˆθi and ˆθj with the estimated parameter vector ˆθ and the expected (or “true”) value of that parameter vector θ. Bias errors (i. e. lim M →∞ E [ ˆθ ] ̸=θ) shall be excluded here. The diagonal elements of the matrix contain the variances of each parameter and the off- diagonal elements the covariances of each pair of parameters. Assuming the covari- ance matrix is known and the estimated parameters follow a normal distribution, conﬁdence intervals can be constructed: E [ ˆθi ] ∈ [ ˆθi − 3σi i, ˆθi + 3σi i ] (with 99.073% conﬁdence). (A.6) Here a 3σ conﬁdence interval is assumed, which states that, based on the provided data, there is only a 0.027% chance that ˆθi is outside of that interval. Usually, the covariance matrix is a priori unknown and, hence, needs to be estimated from the data provided, as well. It can be shown that it is given by ˆCov ( ˆθ ) = ˆλ0 [ ΦT Φ ] −1 (A.7) where ˆλ0 denotes the (estimated) variance of the residuals ǫ = ym − ˜y [ j | ˆθ ] and ΦT Φ the matrix of the linear regressor deﬁned in Eq. (A.4). The former needs to be estimated from the data by ˆλ0 = 1 M − (N + 1) M∑ j =1 ( ym [ j ] − ˜y [ j | ˆθ ] )2. (A.8) Knowing that the SNR of a signal is computed by the quotient of the variance of the signal over the variance of the noise, it now becomes clear that the conﬁdence intervals scale with the SNR. Fig. A.4 depicts the 3σ conﬁdence intervals resulting from identiﬁcation of the shown FIR coefﬁcients. They are very small in both cases and, thus, the shown coefﬁcients ˆθi = hi very likely represent the actual underlying dynamics of the system. All other setups discussed in this thesis exhibit similarly small conﬁdence intervals. Therefore, visualizations of conﬁdence intervals are omitted for all IR and FR plots. In order to further clarify the presentation by leaving out unnecessary information, throughout the thesis, impulse responses are shown as line plots ( ) and leave out a visualiza- tion of the FIR coefﬁcients ( ). Numerical Response Analysis Residual Analysis A set of very useful tests on how well the resulting model is able to capture the de- terministic part in the output signalym considers the residuals ǫ = ym − Φ ˆθ, i. e. the differences between model predictions ˜y = Φ ˆθ and the actually measured output time series data ym. Assuming that the model structure shown in Fig. A.2 describes reality and the length of the available time series data approaches inﬁnity, the respectively estimated model parameters would asymptotically converge to those of the “real sys- tem” — assuming zero bias and a sufﬁcient number of FIR coefﬁcients. The model obtained would then ﬁlter out all of the deterministic contenty from the measured signal ym and, thus, the resulting residual time series data would be perfectly erratic. Based on this fact, it is possible to assess the quality of an estimated model and how reasonable the chosen model structure is. The ability of a model to capture the deter- ministic part of the input/output relation can be evaluated by statistically analyzing the resulting residual time series dataǫ: the more erratic and less correlated to the input signal it is, the better the estimated model performs. Consequently, the model requiring the smallest number of parameters while fulﬁlling the aforementioned two criteria should be chosen. This avoids overﬁtting, i. e. capturing erratic contents of the output signal by the deterministic model, and ensures that the underlying system dynamics is properly grasped. T wo correlations need to be evaluated: (1) The (sample) cross-correlation of the resid- uals with the input signal ˆγu e[n] = M∑ i =1 ǫ[i ]u[i + n] √ M∑ i =1 ǫ[i ]ǫ[i ] √ M∑ i =1 u[i ]u[i ] (A.9) and (2) the (sample) auto-correlation of the residuals ˆγe e[n] = M∑ i =1 ǫ[i ]ǫ[i + n] M∑ i =1 ǫ[i ]ǫ[i ] (A.10) where the lag τ = n∆t is an integer multiple of the sampling time ∆t. Both are again estimates of the “true” correlations based on the provided data, assuming zero mean ofǫ and u. The auto-correlation of ǫ is deﬁned as the covariance of the time series ǫ with an instance of itself shifted by a lag τ and normalized by its variance. Plotting ˆγe e(τ) over the time lag τ provides an estimates of inherent correlations of the residuals ǫ. Assuming ǫ was purely erratic (white noise), this plot would be zero everywhere but for lag zero, where it is unity. Of course, since ˆγe e(τ) is only an estimate of the residual auto-correlation, its values at different lags are uncertain. In order to test a A.2 CFD/SI Method − 1 γee [-] − 2 − 1 0 1 2 − 1 τ∗ [-] γue [-] (a) Slit − 1 γee [-] − 2 − 1 0 1 2 − 1 τ∗ [-] γue [-] (b) Bunsen Figure A.5: Auto- and cross-correlation data of residuals ˆγe e and ˆγu e, respectively, resulting from the identiﬁed models shown in Fig. A.4, plotted over a non-dimensionalized lagτ∗ = τ/τr. 3σ conﬁdence regions are added (gray area, framed by ). signal for whiteness, intervals can be provided within which ˆγe e is not signiﬁcant, i. e. although it might be different from zero it can to good degree be assumed to be zero. For sufﬁciently high M, this interval can be computed as ±3/ ∝∇adicallow M, which corresponds to a 99.073% region of conﬁdence. Similarly, the cross-correlation is deﬁned as the covariance of u and ǫ at different lags τ normalized by the standard deviations of u and ǫ at zero lag. Hence, any value of | ˆγe e| >3/ ∝∇adicallow M would suggest a linear relation of u and ǫ at the corresponding lag τ (with a conﬁdence of 99.073%). Fig. A.5 shows the auto- and cross-correlations of the residuals that correspond to the identiﬁed models depicted in Fig. A.4 plotted over a non-dimensionalized lag τ∗ = τ/τr. All cross-correlation coefﬁcients are within the above deﬁned region of conﬁdence and, hence, are not signiﬁcant. Therefore, no signiﬁcant hint of linear deterministic input/output relations not captured by the models can be found in the data. It can be concluded, that (1) the assumed structure of the system (see Fig. A.2) captures the real behavior very well and that (2) the identiﬁed FIR model represents the transfer behavior to a very good degree. A similar conclusion can be draw from the auto-correlations. However, the plot of the Slit ﬂames shows some signiﬁcant coefﬁcients at lags|τ∗| <1. Since the cross- correlation shows no hint of input/output relations not captured by the model, they have to be a consequence of the chosen model structure. The damped oscillatory be- havior of the Slit ﬂame IR shown in Fig. A.4 a requiring 44 FIR coefﬁcients indicates Numerical Response Analysis an autoregressive behavior of the system, i. e. the present output of the system does not only depend on past and present inputs but also on past outputs. Using a system structure that allows for such autoregressive interactions, such as an ARX model, could reduce the required number of model parameters. At the same time, also the erratic parte would be subjected to the autoregressive system behavior and, hence, its contribution to ym would be colored instead of white. It has been shown by So- vardi (Sec. 4.02.05) that for such situations, application of an ARX model would indeed lead to a reduction of the residual auto-correlation. It was checked by the au- thor of this thesis that this also holds for the Slit ﬂame case discussed here. However, although the auto-correlation ofǫ exhibits strong hints that the underlying signal is not white, its relevance for the time series data is very minor due to the fact that the amplitude ofǫ is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of ym. This will be illustrated in the following section where the model output is compared with the CFD data output using a test data set. For that reason, it can be concluded that the chosen FIR model performs very well for both types of ﬂames. Comparison with T est Data Set It is a common practice in regression analysis to split the available time series data into a training and a test data set. The ﬁrst is used in order to identify the model parametersˆθ, the second to evaluate the predictive quality of the model on a statisti- cally independent data set. Usually the distance between the model predictions (; Fig. A.3) and the CFD output (; Fig. A.3) is measured in terms of a norm, also known as the ﬁt value: FIT = 100        1 − √ M∑ i =1 ( ym [i ] − ˜y [i ] )2 √ M∑ i =1 ( ym [i ] − ym,mean )2        % (A.11) where ˜y denotes the model output, ym the CFD time series and ym,mean its mean value. Computing the model output for a test data set of the two identiﬁed models shown in Fig. A.4 ( ) results in the time series shown in Fig. A.6. V ery good agreement with the CFD data output ym ( ) is found and results in ﬁt values of 93.087% and 95.08% for the slit and the Bunsen type conﬁguration, respectively. Since the test data set is independent from the trainings data set, it can be concluded that both models are not overﬁtted to the trainings data.

Fit values are 93.087% and 95.08% for the slit and the Bun- sen type conﬁguration, respectively. A.3 Time vs. Frequency Domain Based Response Analysis Besides CFD/SI methods relying on broad band data, there are also other methods to estimate the IR of a ﬂame conﬁguration. A simple direct approach relies on an impul- sively excited ﬂame using a input signalu resembling a Dirac impulse. For example, a Gaussian impulse of small variance and sufﬁciently low amplitude (to not trigger non-linear effects) can be used as input signal. The normalized associated response of the global heat release then provides an estimate of the IR. Such a procedure has one signiﬁcant advantage: It allows for a direct and rather simple analysis of the transient CFD ﬁeld data and, thus, the physical processes that determine the system behav- ior. Without use of further computationally expensive statistical evaluations, such a post-processing of the data is not possible for broad band excitation. The reason behind this property is that an impulsive forcing constitutes the optimal input signal for analyzing causalities. Analyzing transient CFD data subjected to har- monic forcing, for example, might lead to identiﬁcation of coherent (ﬂow) structures that have a strong impact on the respective ﬂame response. However, it is not easy to reveal causal relations, since in a fully established oscillatory state, as it is inherently assumed in frequency domain representations, one cannot distinguish between cause and effect. This can be improved by using broad band forcing, however, as stated above, elaborate and computational expensive computations are required in order to reveal spatially resolved causal relations. Application of an impulsive forcing allows to identify causalities by just naively inspecting the transient CFD ﬁeld data: any change in a certain snapshot has to be directly related to information present in the preceding snapshots. This advantage is payed for by, compared to broad band based methods, less robust response predictions that are caused by the reduced amount of data and, hence, in- Numerical Response Analysis 0 0. 5 1 1. 5 2 − 8 − 4 t∗ [-] h∗ [-] (a) Slit 0 0. 5 1 1. 5 − 1 t∗ [-] h∗ [-] (b) Bunsen 0 0. 5 1 1. 5 2 2. 5 3 − 4 − 2 t∗ [-] h∗ [-] (c) W edge Figure A.7: Comparison of IR predictions resulting from impulsive forcing ( ) as well as from the CFD/SI approach ( ) for three representative se- tups (one for each ﬂame geometry). All simulations were performed at a maximum perturbation velocity amplitude of 2% u 1. For the slit case additionally a simulation at 10% amplitude was performed ( ). formation: the total length of usable time series data equals exactly one times the IR length. Furthermore, conﬁdence intervals as well as quality measures quantifying the resulting model (residual analysis) cannot be speciﬁed without further consider- ations. Hence, in order to get both good estimates of the (linear) response behavior andthe possibility to analyze physical causalities, one has to jointly analyze broad band and impulsively forced systems. It should be noted that the evaluation of the latter is usually only informative for systems exhibiting very low noise levels, such as laminar ﬂames. Processing LES simulations of turbulent ﬂames, the turbulent ﬂuc- tuations will contaminate the output time series data of a step or impulse forcing and cannot be correlated out (using a single simulation). Applying such a joint analysis, it has to be ensured that the impulsively forced sys- tems exhibits the same linear response as the model identiﬁed from broad band data. If that is the case, non-linearities or noise related effects most probably can be ruled out to contaminate the CFD data. Fig. A.7 compares IR predictions resulting from an impulsive forcing ( ) to the ones from the CFD/SI approach ( ) for three representative setups. All setups were forced by a narrow Gaussian impulse with an amplitude of 2% of the bulk ﬂow velocity u 1, see Appendix A.4 for more details. For the Slit setup additionally a forcing with 10% forcing amplitude is shown ( ), which still exhibits the same transfer behavior as the two other cases. Overall, very good agreement can be found for all three conﬁgurations. Only the Bunsen case in Fig. A.7 b shows a minor discrepancy att ∗ ≈ 1.03 but also here the overall IR is captured very well. This result allows to safely analyze impulsively forced CFD data and draw conclusion regarding the physics that governs the linear response. This fact is exploited in Parts II and III by analyzing the transient behavior of ﬂame normal displacements.

Fig. A.8 analyses the amplitude dependence of a Slit ﬂame in more detail. It shows that the linear behavior is to a good degree preserved up to amplitudes of 20%. Only at 40% amplitude non-linear effects signiﬁcantly kick in and effect the response. As shown in Chap. 6, Slit ﬂames exhibited the strongest response of all three investigated ﬂames. Therefore, it can be expected that Bunsen and W edge ﬂames should stay in the linear regime for even higher forcing amplitudes.

(b): Flame shape computed from an CH 4 -isoline of a CFD data snapshot including its normals. The transient behavior of ﬂame normal displacements of impulsively excited ﬂames is discussed in several sections of this thesis, see for example Fig. 5.01 (middle). De- tails on the computation and post-processing of theses results are provided in the following. Background information on the motivation for such a kind of analysis is Numerical Response Analysis provided in Sec. A.3. The forcing signal employed for all impulsively forced simulations is illustrated in Fig. A.9 a. It exhibits a normalized amplitude, which has yet to be scaled by the level of forcing, e. g. byǫ = 2% u 1. Its shape is described by f (t ) = exp ( −(t − t 0 )2 σ ), (A.12) where t 0 denotes the time at which the impulse forcing has to be applied and σ = 5 e − 7 the width of the Gaussian-like distribution. The temporal integral deﬁnes a reference displacement ˆξ = ∫ ∞ 0 ǫf (t )dt. Having performed the impulsively forced transient numerical simulations, snapshots at several instants in time are taken and CH 4 -isolines extracted. The respective CH 4 values are chosen such that the resulting isoline adequately captures the spatial distri- bution of the heat release. The ﬁrst snapshot corresponds to a time before the forcing is applied (t < t 0 ) and is deﬁned to represent the unperturbed steady state solution. For this snapshot, ﬂame normals are evaluated. An exemplary result is sketched in Fig. A.9 b. Having done this, ﬂame normal deviations from the steady state are eval- uated for all subsequent snapshots. Finally, the resulting ﬂame normal displacements from the steady state ﬂame are normalized by the aforementioned reference displace- mentˆξ in order to ensure comparability with other simulations or with LOM predic- tions. B Impact of the Anchoring W all T emperature Some of the shown CFD/SI results shown in this work were conducted at different temperatures of the wall above which the ﬂame is anchored, denoted as TBP. The literature provides evidence that this temperature has a crucial impact on the associ- ated acoustic ﬂame response. Therefore, its consequences for the FTF of the investigated ﬂame conﬁgurations are assessed in the following. In order to specify wall temperatures, a non-dimensional quantity T ∗ BP = TBP /Tad is introduced relating the temperature of a wall TBP to the adiabatic ﬂame temperature Tad. Adiabatic walls hence have a non-dimensional temperature of unity. Figs. B.1 and B.2 show steady state and acoustic response data of three Slit and Bun- sen ﬂames, respectively, anchored above a back-plate exhibiting different temperature boundary conditions: (1) adiabatic walls, (2)TBP = 700 K and (3) TBP = 373 K. These boundaries were chosen as limiting cases of the range of possible (uncooled) wall temperatures. The study of Kornilovet al speciﬁed the prevailing wall tem- perature of a Slit ﬂame setup to 373 − 423 K. This serves as an estimate of the lower threshold of possible temperatures and, hence, TBP = 373 K deﬁnes a ﬁrst sampling point. According to Mejia et al, the temperature of their cylindrical bluff body could reach temperatures up to 700 K. Since around temperatures of 750 − 800 K the backplate would start to radiate light in the visible wavelengths (“incandescence”), which is not reported from experimental studies, a temperature of TBP = 700 K was chosen to deﬁne the upper limit of temperatures of interest. The adiabatic chase was added primarily because of academic interests. Such conﬁgurations deﬁne the limit- ing cases where the ﬂame is anchored directly at the trailing edge. All shown frequency and impulse response data are non-dimensionalized by use of the characteristic time of restorationτr. It is determined here by demanding that all IRs have to coincide at t ∗ = 1. This exploits the fact that all IRs are qualitatively very similar and that the main difference can be related to a scaling of the frequency and time scales of the FR and IR representations, respectively. In order to effectively visualize the behavior of the characteristic time of restoration, relative changes of the time of restoration ∆τ∗ r= τr − τr,ref τr,ref (B.1) are plotted in Figs. B.1 and B.2. Hereby, the characteristic time of the conﬁgurations exhibiting the minimalτr serves as the reference time τr,ref. Impact of the Anchoring W all T emperature Figure B.1: Effect of temperature of the back-plate TBP on on the FTF (left) and the mean ﬂow ﬁeld (right) for Slit ﬂame conﬁgurations at Re = 650, φ = 0.08 and Cr = 0.04. Close-up views of the steady state ﬂame anchoring are provided for each setup (middle and lower row, right half). Figure B.2: Effect of temperature of the back-plate TBP on on the FTF (left) and the mean ﬂow ﬁeld (right) for Bunsen ﬂame conﬁgurations at Re = 650, φ = 0.08 and Cr = 0.04. Close-up views of the steady state ﬂame anchoring are provided for each setup (middle and lower row, right half). From the data shown it becomes clear that variations of the wall temperature mainly lead to variations ofτr, while the qualitative behavior of the IR/FR representations are essentially maintained. This directly translates to a signiﬁcant change of the FTF phase of the three setups, when plotted over dimensional frequency. It is hence con- cluded that variations of the wall temperature right at the ﬂame anchoring predomi- nantly lead to signiﬁcant changes in the phase of the corresponding FTF and only to rather weak changes of the gain. While all analyzed data provides evidence thatτr increases with rising TBP, the gain does not behave as regularly and can show both higher and lower amplitudes. On the detailed mechanisms that are responsible for this behavior can only be speculated. From the data provided, it seems that cooled walls lead to a low speed region upstream of the ﬂame base, which might lead to an increase ofτr. All in all, comparing FR/IR representations of different TBP in non- dimensionalized form, it can in a ﬁrst approximation be assumed that their overall shape remain unchanged and predominantly the respectiveτr varies. Impact of the Anchoring W all T emperature C Flame T ransfer Functions In the following, analytical FTF expressions for two different models are provided, which were both introduced in Chap. 6. C.1 Convective Incompressible FTFs with Gaussian Kernel By solving Eq. (1.032) (assumingl M = 0) using the velocity perturbations speciﬁed by Eqs. (6.019) and (6.020), we get for the ﬂame front displacement of Slit and Bunsen ﬂames ξΛ(x F 1, t ) = sin(α) τr τr − τc { ( 1 + f g τc τr − τc )[ G ( t − x F L f τc ) −G ( t − x F L f τr )] + f g τc [ 1 − x F L f ] g ( t − x F L f τc ) −f g τc g ( t − x F L f τr ) }, (C.1) and for the one for W edge ﬂames ξV (x F 1, t ) = sin(α) τr τr − τc { ( 1 − f g τc τr − τc )[ G ( t − x F L f τc ) −G ( t − x F L f τr )] + f g τc [ ˜r 1 − ˜r + x F L f ] g ( t − x F L f τc ) −f g τc ˜r 1 − ˜r g ( t − x F L f τr ) }. (C.2) Here, G (y ) is deﬁned as the antiderivative of g (y ): G (y ) = ∫ g (y )dy. Similarly, a quantity Γ(y ) = ∫ G (y )dy is deﬁned. T ab. C.1 summarizes all those expressions for a Dirac and a Gaussian kernel function.

Abstract This thesis discusses the modeling of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. On the one hand two different types of hybrid CFD/low-order models are inves- tigated. These models resolve the ﬂame and its immediate vicinity with reactive ﬂow simulations. The acoustic ﬁeld is modeled via a coupled acoustic low- order model. One of the hybrid CFD/low-order models resolve the ﬂame with a fully compressible and reactive CFD simulation. So called Characteristic Based State-Space Boundary Conditions (CBSBC), which have been developed within this thesis, are used to couple the simulation via characteristic wave amplitudes to the acoustic low-order model. The other hybrid CFD/low-order model inves- tigated resolves the ﬂame with a low-Mach CFD simulation. Here, the coupling is based on the ﬂuctuations of a reference velocity and of the global heat release rate. A cross-validation in terms of a bifurcation analysis shows good agreement between the two models. This corroborates that premixed ﬂame respond pre- dominantly to ﬂuctuations of the upstream velocity and that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects and ﬂame kinematics. Hybrid CFD/low-order models describe thermoacoustic oscillations accurately and reduce the computational costs signiﬁcantly compared to fully compressible simulations of the whole domain. However, the computational effort is still con- siderable. Therefore, on the other hand, nonlinear extensions of the CFD/system identiﬁcation (SI) approach are investigated. The CFD simulation is forced with a broadband, high-amplitude signal and the time series of the ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity and of the global heat release rate are collected. Thereafter, system identiﬁcation is applied in order to obtain nonlinear low-order models. Artiﬁcial neural networks are used as nonlinear model structure. It is found that these models can reproduce the forced response up to a certain amplitude level. The nonlinear low-order models are then combined with a thermoacoustic network model in order to model the self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. Unfortunately, the oscillations predicted differ signiﬁcantly from the ones pre- ii dicted by the hybrid models. Theoretically, good agreement can be achieved, if sufﬁciently long time series are available. Our analysis indicates that generating sufﬁciently long time series is prohibitively expensive. Hybrid CFD/low-order models, such as those developed in the present thesis, appear to be more promis- ing. It is expected that with this methodology it is possible to simulate self- excited thermoacoustic oscillations with high accuracy and reasonable compu- tational effort. iii Contents Abstract ii Acknowledgment vi List of supervised Students vii 1 Introduction 1 2 A few words on systems theory 5 2.01 Continuous-time models. 6 2.02 Discrete-time models. 10 3 System identiﬁcation 13 3.01 Setting up the CFD simulation. 14 3.02 Running the simulation. 14 3.03 Post-processing of the time series collected. 14 3.04 Fit a model to the data. 15 3.05 Validation of the model. 16 4 Modeling of thermoacoustic oscillations 19 4.01 Modeling of the acoustics. 20 4.02 Modeling of the ﬂame dynamics. 22 5 Summary of achievements and papers 25 5.01 P APER -GREY BOX. 26 5.02 P APER -CBSBC. 27 5.03 P APER -HYBRID. 28 5.04 P APER -ANN. 29 6 Outlook 31 iv Bibliography 33 Appendices A.1 P APER -GREY BOX. 41 A.2 P APER -CBSBC. 51 A.3 P APER -HYBRID. 66 A.4 P APER -ANN. 74 v Acknowledgment The ﬁnancial support from the Research Association for Combustion Engines (Forschungsvereinigung Verbrennungskraftmaschinen e.

A self-amplifying feedback between an unsteady heat source and the surrounding acoustic ﬁeld yields large oscillations of the ﬂow variables. These oscillations can reach amplitude levels at which they cause serious damage to the engine. For the case of a perfectly premixed ﬂame, the fundamental mech- anism is illustrated and explained in Fig. 1.01. As noted by Culick et al, thermoacoustic instabilities have been observed during the development of prac- tically all rocket engines. In gas turbine combustion chambers thermoacoustic oscillations limit the operational ﬂexibility. Giacomazzi discuss the problems occurring when gas turbines are used as backup solution for re- newable power plants, such as wind turbines or solar power plants. For this purpose gas turbines have to compensate the unsteady power generation of the renewable power plants and therefore, have to adjust their operating condition quickly and ﬂexibly. A well established method to describe thermoacoustic instabilities is linear sta- bility analysis [14–18]. This methodology allows to predict stable and unstable operating ranges. A generic stability map is shown in Fig. 1.02. Typically, it is assumed that the stable operating range is acceptable and that the unstable oper- ating range should be avoided. This, however, is a very conservative assumption. As indicated in Fig. 1.02, according to the linear analysis small perturbations de- cay exponentially in the stable regime and grow exponentially in the unstable regime. Theoretically, according to the linear stability analysis, small perturba- tions grow to inﬁnity in the unstable regime. Obviously, this is unphysical. In real engines nonlinear effects will become important and the engine exhibits a thermoacoustic oscillations with a ﬁnite amplitude. If this amplitude is below a certain threshold, the oscillation will not damage the engine. Hence, knowing the oscillation amplitude allows to extend the operating range of the engine. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is the development of methods to predict the amplitude of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. Thermoacoustic oscillation can be very complex. Kabiraj et al observed periodic, aperiodic and chaotic oscillations as well as hysteresis while study- ing a laminar premixed ﬂame. Such complex oscillations can only be described with nonlinear models. For gas turbine engines the two most important non- linear effects are the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics [20–22] and nonlinear acoustic damping. The present thesis focuses on modeling the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. The most common model is the ﬂame describing function 3 (FDF) proposed by Dowling. Noiray et al demonstrated that an FDF com- bined with a linear model for the acoustics can predict limit cycle amplitudes, mode switching and instability triggering with good accuracy. The conﬁgura- tion investigated was a laminar matrix burner. With the FDF it is also possi- ble to model thermoacoustic oscillations of turbulent combustors (see e.g. ). The FDF framework has two signiﬁcant drawbacks: (1) It can describe only harmonic limit cycles, i.e. thermoacoustic oscillations with a single dom- inant frequency. More complex types of oscillations cannot be predicted. (2) It is very expensive to determine an FDF. Commonly, a given conﬁguration is forced with harmonic signals at a large number of frequencies and amplitudes. This procedure can in principle be applied to experimental as well as to simulated ﬂames [29–32]. However, this approach is prohibitively expen- sive for large parameter studies in industrial applications. A detailed discussion on other nonlinear models proposed is provided in Sec. 4.02. The methods investigated in this thesis aim to overcome both issues. On the one hand, in PAPER -CBSBC and P APER -HYBRID, hybrid CFD/low-order models are investigated: The ﬂame is simulated with a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) solver, which is coupled to a linear model of the acoustics. These mod- els can describe self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations accurately, and reduce the effort compared to a CFD simulation of the whole conﬁguration signiﬁ- cantly. The novelty of the hybrid formulations developed in the present thesis is their consistency, (no spurious waves are generated), and their robustness and ﬂexibility (complex impedances can be imposed and the formulation works for laminar as well as for turbulent ﬂows). However, the hybrid models are still ex- pensive. Therefore, on the other hand, CFD/system identiﬁcation (SI) ap- proach is investigated: a transient simulation is forced with a broadband signal and time series are collected from which low-order model are deduced via sys- tem identiﬁcation. In PAPER -GREY BOX linear grey-box models are discussed, 3 A describing function is a frequency response which depends on the amplitude of the excitation signal (see also Sec. 4.02). ¯u+ u′ ¯˙q+ ˙q′ Figure 1.01: Thermoacoustic coupling: A perturbation u′ of the mean ﬂow velocity ¯ucauses a ﬂuctuation ˙q′ of the mean heat release rate ¯˙q. The additional heat yields an expan- sion of the gas surrounding the ﬂame. Thus, the ﬂame acts as an unsteady volume source and consequently as a sound source. The acoustic waves emitted, are re- ﬂected at the combustion chamber walls and again cause a perturbation u′ of the mean ﬂow at the ﬂame base. This closes the feedback. which allow among other things to estimate the heat release rate ﬂuctuations from acoustic measurements only. Following the work of Selimefendigil et al [34–36] in P APER -ANN a nonlinear extension of the CFD/SI approach is in- vestigated. Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are used to model the nonlinear dynamics of a laminar premixed ﬂame. In theory, when very long time series are available, the ANN identiﬁed should represent the CFD model accurately. The uncertainty of the prediction made by the models identiﬁed is assessed. The results indicated that generating sufﬁciently long time series is prohibitively ex- pensive and that more sophisticated models are required. The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: In Chap. 2 some fundamen- tal properties of dynamical systems are derived and discussed. System identi- ﬁcation is discussed in detail in Chap. 3. Chap. 4 focuses on the modeling of thermoacoustic oscillations. In Chap. 5 the publications contributing to this the- sis are summarized. stable=good! unstable=bad? parameter 2 parameter 1 p(t) p(t)p(t) t t p(t)p(t) t t t exponential decay exponential growth thermoacoustic oscillation Figure 1.02: Generic example of a linear stability map and possible types of oscillations occur- ring in the stable and in the unstable regime. 2 A few words on systems theory The present thesis builds on a system theoretic perspective of the modeling of thermoacoustic oscillations. This perspective has been developed over the last decades by several authors. The most important results of systems theory are discussed in the present chapter. A detailed review of the literature related to thermoacoustics is provided in Chap. 4. The material discussed in the present chapter is well known to the systems theory community and can be found in a large number of books. The author of the present thesis used the books by Lunze. In Fig. 2.01 a generic dynamical system G is shown. It connectsminputs u(t) = [u 1(t),u m(t)]T and p outputs y(t) = [ y 1(t),y p(t)]T. Mathematically, we write this as y(t) = G ◦ u(t). G denotes the operator of the system and tthe time. The symbol “◦” describes the dynamic mapping of the inputs u to the outputs y via the operator G. The most general classiﬁcation of systems is between linear and nonlinear sys- tems. Linear systems fulﬁll the principle of additivity G ◦ (u 1 + u 2) = G ◦ u 1 + G ◦ u 2, and the principle of homogeneity G ◦ (αu) = α(G ◦ u). If at least one of these principles is violated the system is callednonlinear. This is the only common feature of nonlinear systems and thus, these systems are hard to characterize in general. Indeed, an large eddy simulation (LES) solver can be considered as a nonlinear system. In the present work, we will discuss the ﬂame dynamics as a speciﬁc type of nonlinear systems in Sec. 4.02. Within the present chapter we focus the discussion on linear systems. G u 1 um y 1 yp. Figure 2.01: Generic dynamical system 2.01 Continuous-time models A linear system can be represented without loss of generality in state-space form: ˙x = Ax + Bu, (2.01) y = Cx + Du, (2.02) with the system matrices A ∈ Rn×n,B ∈ Rn×m,C ∈ Rp×n,D ∈ Rp×m and the state-vector x ∈ Rn×1. Here, n is the order of the system. The system matrices can be determined in manifold ways. In PAPER -CBSBC an overview of the most appropriated approaches to obtain these matrices for thermoacoustic systems is provided, written by the author of the present thesis. A state-space model is not a unique representation of a speciﬁc system. We can introduce a transformation matrix T ∈ Rn×n with full rank and deﬁne the transformation x = Tz. Inserted in (2.01) this yields ˙z = T−1 ATz+ T−1 Bu, y = CTz + Du. For example, such a transformation can represent a transformation of units or a reordering of equations. All system matrices are changed, while the system still describes the same physics. Consequently, many properties (e.g. stability, transfer behavior) of the model are preserved. Please note that although the system describes the same physics, the transformation can change its numerical properties signiﬁcantly. A linear state-space model is essentially a system of ordinary differential equa- tions (ODE). A large number of properties can be deduced from this perspec- tive. The solution of the ODE can be found with the matrix exponential function given as e At = In + At+ A 2 2! t 2 + A 3 3! t 3 +. with the identity matrix In ∈ Rn×n. An important property of the matrix ex- ponential function is that for a diagonal matrix Λ with the values λi on the diagonal the matrix exponential function can be calculated according to eΛt =   eλ1. eλn  . Its inverse is ( e At)−1 = e−At, and the temporal derivative is given as d dte At = Ae At = e At A. In order to solve the ODE we use the ansatz x(t) = e Atk(t). (2.04) Inserting this expression in Eq. (2.01) yields ˙x = Ae Atk + Bu = Ae Atk + e At˙k ⇒ ˙k = ( e At)−1 Bu = e−At Bu(t) ⇒ k(t) = k(0) + ∫ t e−AτBu(τ)dτ. Together with Eq. (2.04) and the initial condition k(0) = x 0 we obtain x(t) = e Atx 0 + ∫ t e A(t−τ)Bu(τ)dτ + Du(t). Considering the output equation (2.02) of the state-space model this yields the general solution of (2.01) y(t) = Ce Atx 0 + ∫ t Ce A(t−τ)Bu(τ)dτ + Du(t). (2.06) The system matrix A can be decomposed according to A = VΛVT. Here, V is a matrix containing the eigenvectors of A. In the scope of this tutorial we restricted the discussion to eigenvalues with an algebraic multiplicity of one. Thus, Λ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues λi on the diagonal. Using V as transformation matrix, the general solution (2.06) of the state-space model becomes y(t) = CVe VT AVt Vx 0 + ∫ t CVe VTAV(t−τ)VTBu(τ)dτ + Du(t) = CVeΛt VTx 0 + ∫ t CVeΛ(t−τ)VTBu(τ)dτ + Du(t). (2.07) Thus, the response of the system can be described in terms of a sum of expo- nential functions. The response will decay if and only if all real parts of the eigenvalues λi are smaller than zero. In this case the response to an arbitrary initial excitation of the model will decay exponentially. Such models are called asymptotically stable. For an impulse excitation, i.e. u(t) = δ(t) one obtains y(t) = ∫ t Ce A(t−τ)Bδ(τ)dτ + Dδ(t) = Ce At B   h(t) +Dδ(t) Here, h(t) is the impulse response. Inserting this expression in (2.06) one obtains y(t) = ∫ t h(t− τ)u(τ)dτ + Du(t) (2.09) If h(t) is known, the output of the system to an arbitrary input signal can be computed. In that sense the system is characterized by its impulse response. The representation (2.09) is also known is inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) model. Please note that according to Eq. (2.07) the impulse response can be described by exponential functions. For a stable system these functions will decay expo- nentially and thus, never be exactly zero. Therefore, the impulse response of a continuous-time model is always inﬁnite in time. To model thermoacoustic systems the response of the model to harmonic forc- ing signals is of particular importance. Therefore, we consider the response of the state-space model (2.01) to the input signal u(t) = u 0 est. Here, u 0 is the vector of amplitudes of the signal and sis the Laplace variable s= σ+ jω, with the angular frequency ω, the growth rate σ. The response to an harmonic input signal oscillating at frequency ω corresponds to s = jω. Inserting this ansatz in Eq. (2.07) yields y(t,ω) = CVeΛt VTx 0 + ∫ t CVeΛ(t−τ)VTBu 0 esτdτ + Du 0 est. The ﬁrst term represents the transient response and will vanish for long times. y(t,ω) = CV (∫ t eΛ(t−τ)esτdτ ) VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = CV (∫ t eΛτes(t−τ)dτ ) VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = CV (∫ ∞ eΛτes(t−τ)dτ − ∫ ∞ t eΛτes(t−τ)dτ ) VTBu 0 + Du 0 est, for t→∞ the second integral tends to zero as the size of the integration interval decreases. y(t,s) = CV (∫ ∞ eΛτe−sτdτ ) est VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = CV (∫ ∞ e−(s In−Λ)τdτ ) est VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = CV [ −(s In − Λ)−1 e−(s In−Λ)τ ]∞ est VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = CV (s In − Λ)−1 est VTBu 0 + Du 0 est = [ CV (s In − Λ)−1 VTB + D ] u 0 est = [ C ( s In − VΛVT)−1 B + D ] u 0 est = [ C (s In − A)−1 B + D ]    =G(s) u 0 est. G(s) is called the transfer matrix of the state-space model (2.01) G(s) =   G 11(s) ··· G 1 m(s). Gp 1(s) ··· Gpm(s)  = C (s In − A)−1 B + D. The elements Gij = Yi(s)/Uj(s) of the transfer matrix G(s) are the transfer functions from the j-th input to the i-th output of the state-space model. Please note, this result can be obtained in a much simpler manner via the Laplace transform. With the modal transformation it can also be shown that each transfer function is a rational polynomial function G(s) = C (s In − A)−1 B + D = CV (s In − Λ)−1 VTB + D = CV   s− λ1. s− λn   −1 VTB + D =   ˜c 11 ··· ˜c 1 n. ˜cp 1 ··· ˜cpn     s−λ1. s−λn     ˜b 11 ··· ˜b 1 m. ˜bn 1 ··· ˜bnm  + D = n∑ i=1 s− λi   ˜bi 1˜c 1 i ··· ˜bim˜c 1 i. ˜bi 1˜cpi ··· ˜bim˜cpi  .

Here, k is the discrete time increment deﬁned as t = k∆twith the time step ∆t. The general solution of the discrete-time state-space model is given as y(k) = Cd Ak dx 0 + k−1∑ i=0 Cd Ak−1−i d Bdu(i) + Ddu(i) (2.014) This solution can be found by inserting Eq. (2.013) iteratively into itself. A discrete-time state-space model is stable if all eigenvalues of Ad have a magni- tude smaller than 1. As for continuous-time models, the impulse response model of a discrete-time time model can be deduced imposing an impulse excitation, i.e. δd(k) = { 1/∆t for k= 0 0 else This yields y(k) = Cd Ak−1 d Bd/∆t   hd(k) +Ddδd(k). Inserted into Eq. (2.014) yields y(k) = k−1∑ i=0 hd(k− i)∆tu(i) + Ddu(i) Thus, as for the continuous-time models, knowing the impulse response is suf- ﬁcient to calculate the output of a discrete-time model for an arbitrary input signal. The impulse response of discrete-time models has one signiﬁcant dif- ference compared to the impulse response of continuous-time models: If the matrix Ais Nilpotent 4 the impulse response will be ﬁnite. The corresponding model is called ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) model. Applying the z-transform to Eq. (2.02) yields the frequency response of the model G(z) = Cd(z In − Ad)−1 Bd + Dd. (2.015) As for continuous-time models it can be shown that the z-transfer matrix can be represented as rational polynomial function. In order to calculate the response of the model to a harmonic excitation at frequency ωwe set z = ejω∆t. 4 i.e. it exists a k∈ N such that Ak = 0. All eigenvalues of a Nilpotent matrix are equal to zero. The z-transfer matrix of a discrete-time model can be converted in to a continuous-time transfer matrix. For this we ﬁrst discretize the continouse-time state-space model (2.01) in time using a forward Euler scheme: xk+1 = (I + ∆t A)   Ad xk + ∆t B Bd uk yk = C Cd xk + D Dd uk inserting these expressions for the system matrices of the discrete-time model into Eq. (2.015) yields G(z) = C (z In − (I + ∆t A))−1 ∆t B + D = C  z− 1 ∆t =s In − A   −1 B + D Thus by choosing s= z− 1 ∆t ⇔ z = 1 + s∆t a continuous time transfer matrix can be transformed into a discrete-time trans- fer matrix and vise versa. This transformation is an approximation and intro- duces the error made by the use of the forward Euler scheme. The methodol- ogy can be extended for other schemes. As shown in, applying a Crank- Nicholson discretization of Eq. (2.01) yields the famous Tustin transformation. 3 System identiﬁcation The most common way to build models is to use the relations provided by fun- damental principles, such as mass or energy conservation etc. This, however, is a very challenging task and the agreement with validation data is often insufﬁ- cient. One way to overcome this issue is to ﬁt some or even all of the model pa- rameters to measured data. This creates the risk of over-ﬁtting. Nevertheless, the quality of the predictions made by such empirical models is often signiﬁcantly higher than models built entirely on fundamental principles. System identiﬁca- tion (SI) provides a general framework to build empirical models in an efﬁcient and consistent manner. Dependent on the data available different methods are needed. Experimental data is often provided in terms of a frequency response. Bothien et al and PAPER -CBSBC discuss, with a focus on thermoacoustic problems, how to use this kind of data to build models. Typically, frequency re- sponses are determined by forcing a given system at several distinct frequencies and by post-processing the data collected with a Fourier transform. Applying the same procedure to a CFD simulation is extremely expensive, as it requires a large number of simulations. In the present chapter we discuss system identiﬁ- cation methods that allow to deduce a model from a CFD simulation efﬁciently. The key idea is to force the simulation with a broadband signal. This signals excites all frequencies simultaneously and allows to deduce an empirical low- order model from data generated by a single simulation. The procedure is called CFD/SI approach. Polifke provides an overview of this approach. Overall, the method can be divided into four steps: Setting up the CFD simulation, run- ning the simulation, pre-processing the data, ﬁtting the model to the data and validating the model. A schematic overview of the method is shown in Fig. 3.01. In the remainder of this chapter these steps are discussed in detail. 3.01 Setting up the CFD simulation The ﬁrst step is to setup a CFD simulation. This step does not differ from any other CFD simulation, except that one has to be able to impose a forcing sig- nal and to collect the output signal. For example. if, as in the present case, one wants to obtain a low-order model for the ﬂame dynamics, one has to be able to force the inﬂow velocity with an arbitrary signal and to collect the result- ing ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate. Many CFD solvers provide this functionality out of the box, otherwise the necessary modiﬁcations are minimal. This makes the CFD/SI approach applicable to a large number of problems. 3.02 Running the simulation The second step is to run the simulation with an appropriate excitation signal. A general method to create signals well suited for the CFD/SI approach was proposed by F ¨oller et al. The most important property of the signal is the cutoff frequency. It should be chosen such that all frequencies of interest are excited. Besides this the excitation amplitude is to be selected. For the linear CFD/SI approach a constant amplitude with a value as large as possible without exciting nonlinear effects should be chosen. For the nonlinear CFD/SI approach larger amplitudes and preferably non-constant amplitudes should be used. Addi- tionally, the time series have to be signiﬁcantly longer. Indeed, in PAPER -ANN time series that are up to 30 times longer than time series sufﬁcient for the linear CFD/SI approach are used. It is found that even for these extremely long time series the variance of results is signiﬁcant. 3.03 Post-processing of the time series collected After running the simulation, the time series collected have to be pre-processed before the system identiﬁcation methods can be applied. On the one hand this means to normalize the data. On the other hand the data is sampled down. This step is necessary, as discrete time models are commonly used for the identiﬁca- tion. Consequently, the time steps of the model and of the data have to be equal. The down sampling rate is an additional parameter which has to be chosen. This step can be avoided if continuous-time models are used for the identiﬁcations (see e.g. ). To the best of our knowledge continuous time system identiﬁca- tion has not yet been applied to thermoacoustic problems. 3.04 Fit a model to the data The next step is to choose a suitable model structure given as y(t,Θ) = G(Θ) ◦ u(t), with the vector of unknown parameters Θ. In the linear regime a state-space model (see Eq. (2.02)) provides a general model structure 5. In the nonlinear regime a large number of different model structures are available. At this point we refer to Isermann et al and Nelles. Nonlinear models suitable to model the ﬂame dynamics are discussed in Sec. 4.02. The vector of unknown parameter can be determined by solving a least squares optimization problem ˆΘ = argmin Θ { N∑ i=0 ∥y(ti) − ˆy(ti,Θ)∥2 }. Here, ˆΘ is the identiﬁed parameter vector, N is the number of sampled data points, y denotes the measured output signal and ˆy the output predicted by the model. Depending on the model structure, different algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. Using a fully parametrized state-space model as given in Eq. (2.02), which provides a general structure for linear models, how- ever, yields numerical difﬁculties. This is because a state-space model has a large number of redundant parameters. As discussed in the previous chapter a state-space model can be transformed into a transfer function described by rational polynomial functions. This transformation preserves the input-output behavior of the model. However, the state-space model hasn 2 +(m+p)n+pm parameters while, the corresponding transfer function only n−1 +npm. Thus, the parameters of the state-space models are linearly dependent in respect to the transfer behavior of the state-space model. This results in a poorly condi- tioned optimization problem, which is why for a long time only transfer func- tions were used for identiﬁcation. The Wiener-Hopf inversion used frequently to identify the ﬂame transfer function is one of these techniques. Ro- bust algorithms for the identiﬁcation of fully parametrized state-space models are the subspace identiﬁcation methods [53–55] and gradient based algorithms, which calculate the search direction according to the data-driven local coordi- nates (DDLC) parametrization. These algorithms are expected to be ad- vantageous for problems with a large number of input and output signals. For 5 Note, in this work only a deterministic model is discussed. The CFD/SI approach can be extended in such a way that model of the noise source is identiﬁed. This is extensively discussed by Sovardi et al [42–48]. nonlinear system identiﬁcation the parameters used depend strongly on the non- linear model structure. The algorithm used to identify artiﬁcial neural networks is called error back propagation. Using an V olterra series 6 yields an linear optimization problems. A variety of algorithms has been proposed to identify Hammerstein-Wiener models (see e.g. [56–59]). A discussion from a thermoa- coustic perspective for some model structures can be found in [34–36] and in PAPER -ANN. As LES requires a huge computational effort, the time series used for the CFD/SI approach are often very short. In this limit regularization can improve the quality of the models identiﬁed. The idea is to add constraints to the opti- mization problem: ˆΘ = argmin Θ { N∑ i=0 ∥y(ti) − ˆy(ti,Θ)∥2 2 + ΘTRΘ }, with the regularization matrix R. This allows to use assumptions e.g. that the impulse response of the model identiﬁed is smooth and decays exponentially. An overview on the methods available can be found in. 3.05 Validation of the model The ﬁnal step is to validate the models identiﬁed. Here, experimental data can be used to validate the CFD simulation only. A comparison of the models iden- tiﬁed and experimental data should only be done if one is sure that the model identiﬁed represents the CFD simulation accurately. In order to investigate this a number of strategies and methods are available. The most reliable methods re- quire to generate additional data. For example one compares the FDF deduced directly from the CFD simulation against the one predicted by the nonlinear model identiﬁed. When self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations are to be mod- eled, it is ideal to compare the oscillations predicted by the CFD simulation against the one predicted by the nonlinear model identiﬁed. In order to avoid additional error sources the CFD simulation and the nonlinear model should be coupled with the same model for the acoustics. This was done within the scope of the present thesis in P APER -ANN. Other methods are residual analysis or Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). These methods do not require addi- tional data. However, their reliability is much lower and they can be used only in the linear regime. 6 This model structure is also called nonlinear auto regressive (NLARX) models. The validation of the model can fail for several reasons. In order to ﬁnd the error source in a systematic manner one may follow the steps shown in Fig. 3.01 from bottom to top. A possible error source is the identiﬁcation algorithms used. As non-deterministic algorithms are used to identify artiﬁcial neural networks, simply restarting the optimization can yield a better model. For the Wiener- Hopf inversion the regularization can be changed. The next possible error is the model structure. Here, one can e.g. change the number of the impulse response coefﬁcients or the structure of an artiﬁcial neural network. Another error source is the pre-processing of the data used for the identiﬁcation. This kind of error is most often related to an incorrect down sampling rate. However, one should also check the normalization of the data. If all these possible errors sources can be excluded, the issue is related to the CFD simulation. At best the time series are too short. In this case one should simple continue the simulation. In order to obtain a continuous time series, it is necessary that the broadband excitation sig- nal is long enough. Therefore, it is best practice to create an excitation signal, which is at least ten times longer than the required simulation time expected. Obviously, this signal should be created before the ﬁrst simulation is started. In the linear regime conﬁdence intervals allow to estimate the uncertainty of the model with respect to the length of the time series used. Sovardi et al discuss this strategy and use it to identify the scattering matrix of an oriﬁce. With sufﬁciently long time series one should always be able to identify a proper model. Please note, as shown in PAPER -ANN in the nonlinear regime one may not be able to create sufﬁciently long time series. Another possible issue with the excitation signal is the amplitude. For the linear regime it should be as high as possible without exciting nonlinear effects. In the nonlinear regime the exci- tation signal should excite all amplitudes of interest. Additionally, the excitation signal should excite all frequencies of interest. Once all issues mentioned above have been solved, one has ensured that the model identiﬁed represents the CFD simulation accurately. The next step is to validate the model identiﬁed against experimental data. If no agreement is obtained the issue either caused by CFD simulation or by the experiment.

Adapted from 4 Modeling of thermoacoustic oscillations In Fig. 4.01 (top) a generic sketch of a premixed combustor is shown. At the left hand side premixed gas is injected into the plenum of the combustor. For swirl ﬂames the swirler coincides with the area contraction. The ﬂame stabilizes after the area expansion. For certain working conditions the combustor will ex- hibit thermoacoustic oscillations. The ﬁrst step to model these oscillations is to separate the acoustics and the ﬂame dynamics, as shown in Fig. 4.01 (middle). In the present project only low-frequency oscillations are considered. In this limit the acoustic wave-lengths are much larger than the relevant length scales of the cross-sections. Therefore, all acoustic waves are plane and can be described in terms of the characteristic wave amplitudes f and g(see e.g. ) f = 1 (p′ A ¯ρ¯c + u′ A ), g = 1 (p′ A ¯ρ¯c − u′ A ), with the density ρ, the speed of sound cand the acoustic ﬂuctuation of pressure p′ A and of velocity u′ A. The symbol (¯·) denotes the temporal average. As shown in Fig. 4.01, f corresponds to the wave traveling in downstream direction and g to the one traveling in upstream direction. In order to model thermoacoustic oscillations, a model which describes how an unsteady heat source ˙q′ generates acoustic waves is necessary. For low- frequency oscillations the minimal acoustic wave length is signiﬁcantly smaller than the axial expansion of the ﬂame. Thus, the ﬂame is acoustically compact and can be considered to be inﬁnitesimally thin. Evaluating the one dimen- sional momentum and energy equations over this inﬁnitesimal ﬂame yields the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. They are given in state-space form as [65–67] [gu fd ] = 1 ζ+ 1 [1 − ζ 2 θ¯u 1 2ζ ζ − 1 θζ¯u 1 ]  fu gd ˙q′  , (4.017) with ζ = ¯ρ3¯c 3/¯ρ4¯c 4 and θ = ¯T 4/¯T 1 − 1. ¯T is the temperature. The index uand ddenote the position upstream and downstream of the ﬂame front, respectively. The Rankine-Hugoniot equation describe a static relationship. Therefore, the corresponding state-space model consists only of the matrix D. The matrices A,B and C are equal to zero. With the Rankine-Hugoniot equations a model that describes how the unsteady heat source acts on the acoustics is available. In order to close the thermoa- coustic feedback loop a model which describes how the acoustics acts on the unsteady heat source is necessary. Perfectly premixed ﬂames react predomi- nantly to ﬂuctuations of the velocity upstream of the ﬂame. Therefore, the ﬂame dynamics can be represented as the dynamical system ˙q′ = Gﬂame ◦ u′. (4.018) In the remainder of this chapters we will ﬁrst discuss the modeling of the acous- tics and then the modeling of the ﬂame dynamics. Finally, we discuss hybrid CFD/low-order modeling approaches of thermoacoustic oscillations. 4.01 Modeling of the acoustics Plane acoustic waves can be described with acoustic network models [14–16]. As shown in Fig. 4.01 (bottom), the key idea is to divide the conﬁguration into several elements. The elements are modeled separately from each other. In a ﬁnal step, all models are interconnected in order to obtain a model for the whole conﬁguration. The internal elements can be represented as scattering matrix [gu fd ] = [S 11(s) S 12(s) S 21(s) S 22(s) ][fu gd ]. The coefﬁcient S 11 describes the reﬂection of the wave fu, which results in the wave gu, and so on (compare Fig. 4.02). The boundary elements can be modeled as reﬂection coefﬁcients Ru(s) and Rd(s). Both the scattering matrix and the reﬂection coefﬁcients describe linear dynam- ical systems and can be represented as linear state-space models. The models for the internal elements are given as ˙x S = ASx S + BS [fu gd ], [gu fd ] = CSx S + DS [fu gd ].

It was ﬁrst proposed by Schuermans et al. The methodology was then gen- eralized by Bothien et al and Emmert et al. A simple model for an area jump is given as (see e.g. ) [gu fd ] = [α−1 α+1 α+12α α+1 α−1 α+1 ]    =Darea jump [fu gd ], with the area ratio α = A 2/A 3. This is a static model and thus, its state-space representation consists of the feed through matrix, only. For the duct sections a model based on the linearized one-dimensional Euler equations can be found. A detailed derivation by the author of this thesis is pro- vided in P APER -CBSBC. Emmert et al discuss how general geometries can be modeled via numerical discretization of linearized perturbation equa- tions. Within the scope of the dissertation of T. Emmert a thermoacoustic network framework called ta X 7 was developed. The author of this thesis supported the development with a lot of discussions, some coding and by being the ﬁrst user. All network models used for the present work were generated with ta X. 4.02 Modeling of the ﬂame dynamics In the limit of small perturbation a linear model can capture the ﬂame dynamics. This linear model is known as ﬂame transfer function (FTF). Well estab- lished methods exist to obtain an FTF. It can be determined from experiment by harmonic forcing or from CFD via the CFD/SI approach, as discussed in the previous chapter. For higher levels of perturbations nonlinear models are necessary. Here, several modeling approaches have been proposed. One model proposed is the ﬂame describing function (FDF). The FDF is 7 https://tax.wiki.tum.de/ an amplitude dependent FTF FDF(ω,A) = F {˙q′(ω,A)} F {u′(ω,A)} with the excitation amplitude A. F {·}denotes the Fourier transform. It has been shown that the FDF in combination with a network model for the acous- tics can predict thermoacoustic oscillations of laminar and turbulent ﬂames. In order to obtain an FDF, a given ﬂame is forced at different frequencies and amplitudes and the resulting ﬂuctuations of the global heat re- lease rate are recorded. With this information the FDF can be obtained via a Fourier transform of the signals. This procedure works for real ﬂames in an ex- periment as well as for simulated ﬂames. For the latter, however, the procedure is extremely expensive as a large number of simulations are necessary. Heckl developed an analytic model based on the FDF. Unfortunately, it is not straight forward (and at the best of our knowledge not possible) to use the ideas behind the FDF in order to develop an identiﬁcation algorithm. This is because the amplitude of a broadband excitation signal is not known in the time domain. Therefore, other model structures are necessary. Another model structure proposed are Hammerstein-Wiener models. As shown in Fig. 4.03, the core of these models is a linear transfer function G(s). The nonlinearity is modeled via two static nonlinear functionsγ1(t) and γ2(t). From the analysis of the FDF it is known that the response of the heat release rate saturates for high excitation amplitude. This effect can be modeled by using a saturation function for γ2(t). In, system identiﬁcation with a Hammerstein-Wiener model was used to determine low-order models of a ﬂame modeled via the G-equation. A very general nonlinear model structure are artiﬁcial neural networks. A generic artiﬁcial neural networks is shown in Fig. 4.04. It consists of several neurons. The structure can be extended by increasing the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer. This allows to model complex nonlinearities. Selimefendigil et al [34–36] used artiﬁcial neural networks to model the non- linear dynamics of the heat transfer of an cylinder in pulsating cross-ﬂow. The potential and limitations of artiﬁcial neural networks to model the dynamic of a laminar premixed ﬂame are investigated in PAPER -ANN. A model for laminar premixed ﬂame is based on the G-equation. The non- linear dynamics of this model agrees qualitatively with experimental results. However, the results depend strongly on the velocity model used and there- fore no quantitative agreement with experimental results is achieved. y G(s) u γ1(t) γ2(t) Figure 4.03: General Hammerstein-Wiener model structure. u(t) u(t− n∆t) σ(·). σ(·) σ(·) σ(·) σ(·) σ(·) σ(·) y(t) layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 Figure 4.04: Generic artiﬁcial neural network (PAPER -ANN) The most accurate, though most expensive, way to model the ﬂame dynamics is a CFD simulation. For low frequencies, as discussed in the present work, the ﬂame is compact. This allows us to utilize a low Mach 8 simulation. Kornilov et al modeled the linear dynamics of a laminar ﬂame with a low Mach CFD solver and compared the results against experiment. Good agreement was reported. Moeck et al and Jaensch et al (P APER -HYBRID ) coupled a low Mach simulation with an acoustic network model in order to model self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. In the coupling is based on the upstream and the downstream velocity. In P APER -HYBRID the coupling is based on the up- stream velocity and the global heat release rate. By inserting Eq. (4.018) into Eq. (4.017) one can easily show that both formulations are equal. If the ﬂame is modeled with a fully compressible simulation, self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations can be captured without the need of an acoustic network model. Nevertheless, it can be advantageous to couple the simulation with an acoustic model: This allows to change the acoustic boundary conditions without chang- ing the mesh. P APER -CBSBC provide an overview over these so called time- domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC). 8 I.e. the density depends on the temperature, but not on pressure. 5 Summary of achievements and papers In this section the achievements and the papers of this doctoral research project are summarized. An overview of all papers is provided in Fig. 5.01. Major parts of the present manuscript were already submitted as ﬁnal report of the FVV project nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. In P APER -GREY BOX a grey-box identiﬁcation approach for thermoacoustic network models was developed. This ansatz allows to use a priori knowledge of the physics of thermoacoustic oscillations (e.g. the Rankine-Hugoniot equa- tions) for the results of the CFD/SI approach. This enables us to deduce the FTF and to the estimate ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate from acoustic measurements only. Furthermore, within this paper the modeling of thermoa- coustic oscillations was analyzed from a system theoretic perspective. In that sense PAPER -GREY BOX can be considered as foundation of the present thesis. In P APER -CBSBC the system theoretic perspective, developed in P APER - GREY BOX, was extended to a novel formulation of time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC). The so called “characteristics based state-space boundary conditions” (CBSBC) allows to impose almost arbitrary reﬂection co- efﬁcients or impedances at the inﬂow and outﬂow boundary conditions of large eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations. In contrast to other TDIBC formulations found in the literature, CBSBC is at the same time numerically robust, avoids drift of the mean ﬂow variables and does not introduce artiﬁcial reﬂections at the boundary. It already has been decided to include the algorithm to the release version of A VBP 9 (Cerfacs and IFP). Furthermore, CBSBC forms the basis of the time-domain impedance BC implemented in LESLIE 10 (Com- putational Combustion Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology). CBSBC made possible the coupling of a compressible CFD code to a low or- der acoustic model. In P APER -HYBRID this was utilized to conduct a bifurca- tion analysis of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations of a laminar premixed ﬂame. As illustrated in Fig. 5.01, the results obtained with the model based on 9 http://cerfacs.fr/en/computational-ﬂuid-dynamics-softwares/ 10 http://www.ccl.gatech.edu/leslie CBSBC were compared against a second model. The second model is based on a low-Mach CFD solver, which is coupled to an acoustic network model ac- cording to the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. Good agreement between the two models was observed. PAPER -HYBRID is the ﬁrst bifurcation study of a laminar ﬂame with high-ﬁdelity models. In PAPER -ANN an extension of the CFD/SI approach to the nonlinear regime is investigated. Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are utilized to model the non- linear dynamics of a laminar ﬂame. A large parameter study was conducted in order analyze the robustness of the method. The results from P APER -HYBRID allowed us to compare self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations predicted by the ANNs identiﬁed directly with the oscillations predicted by the hybrid CFD/low- order models (compare Fig 5.01). Unfortunately, the agreement observed was poor. It is concluded that more sophisticated methods are needed. The main achievements of PAPER -ANN are the systematic way the quality of the nonlin- ear model was investigated and the direct comparison of the quantity of inter- est i.e. the amplitude of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. The procedure proposed should always be used to analyze the capability of novel nonlinear low-order models to predict self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. 5.01 P APER -GREY BOX A G REY-BOX IDENTIFICATION APPROACH FOR THERMOACOUSTIC NET- WORK MODELS S. Jaensch, T. Emmert, C. F. Silva, and W. Polifke, GT 2014-27034, in Pro- ceedings of ASME Turbo Expo, D¨usseldorf, Germany, 2014, 10.01115/GT 2014- 27034. Abstract: This work discusses from a system theoretic point of view the low order modeling and identiﬁcation of the acoustic scattering behavior of a ducted ﬂame. In this context, one distinguishes between black-box and grey-box mod- els. The former rely on time series data only and do not require any physical modeling of the system that is to be identiﬁed. The latter exploit prior knowl- edge of the system physics to some extent and in this sense are physically mo- tivated. For the case of a ﬂame stabilized in a duct, a grey-box model is for- mulated that comprises an acoustic part as well as sub-models for the ﬂame dynamics and the jump conditions for acoustic variables across the region of heat release. Each of the subsystems can be modeled with or without physical a priori knowledge, in combination they yield a model for the scattering behav- ior of the ﬂame. We demonstrate these concepts by analyzing a CFD model of a laminar conical premixed ﬂame. The grey-box approach allows to optimize directly the scattering behavior of the identiﬁed model. Furthermore, we show that the method allows to estimate heat release rate ﬂuctuations as well as the ﬂame transfer function from acoustic measurements only. Contribution: I implemented the SI routines which are not part of Matlab’s SI toolbox, applied the system identiﬁcation methodology and analyzed the results. Additionally, I wrote most of the manuscript. 5.02 P APER -CBSBC ON THE ROBUST, FLEXIBLE AND CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF TIME DOMAIN IMPEDANCE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOW SIMULATIONS S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W. Polifke, Journal of Computational Physics, vol. 314, pp. 145–159, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.jcp.2016.003.0010. Abstract: The accurate simulation of compressible ﬂows requires the appropri- ate modeling of the reﬂection of acoustic waves at the boundaries. In the present study we discuss time domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC). The formulation proposed allows to impose a desired reﬂection coefﬁcient at the inﬂow and outﬂow boundaries. Our formulation is an extension of the well known Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions. The frequency depen- dent reﬂections at the boundaries are implemented with a state-space model in the time domain. We provide a comprehensive discussion on how such state- space models can be constructed and interpreted. This discussion shows that the state-space description allows a robust and ﬂexible implementation. It al- lows to consider complex reﬂection coefﬁcients and account for non constant CFD time steps in a straight forward manner. Furthermore, we prove analyti- cally and demonstrate numerically that the formulation proposed is consistent, i.e. the formulation ensures that the ﬂow simulation exhibits the reﬂection co- efﬁcient imposed accurately, as long as the waves impinging on the boundary are plane, and it prohibits drift of the mean ﬂow variables. Finally, the boundary conditions are tested successfully for laminar and turbulent ﬂows. Contribution: I developed the method, implemented a ﬁrst version of CB- SBC in LESLIE 11, conducted the validation simulations and wrote most of the manuscript. 11 Computational Combustion Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology 5.03 P APER -HYBRID HYBRID CFD/ LOW-ORDER MODELING OF NONLINEAR THERMOACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS S.

Abstract: This paper proposes and compares two nonlinear time-domain mod- els of self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities of laminar premixed ﬂames. The ﬂame and its immediate vicinity are resolved with reactive ﬂow simulations. Simultaneously, the acoustic ﬁeld is modeled with low-order models which are coupled to the reactive ﬂow simulations. On the one hand a model based on the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. Here, the low-order model is coupled to the simulation via the characteristic wave amplitudes at the inlet boundary. The other model resolves the ﬂame with a weakly compressible reactive ﬂow simulation. In order to include the thermoacoustic feedback, this model is coupled with an acoustic network model by the global heat release rate and the ﬂuctuation of the axial velocity at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame. A bifurcation analysis using the plenum length as bifurcation pa- rameter is conducted. Both models exhibit complex nonlinear oscillations. A bifurcation analysis shows that both models are in good agreement with each other. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling of a linear acoustic model and a nonlinear ﬂame model via reference velocity and global heat release rate is sufﬁ- cient to accurately capture nonlinear oscillations of thermoacoustic instabilities. This implies that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrody- namic effects and the ﬂame kinematics. Additionally, the study provides further evidence that premixed ﬂames predominantly respond to ﬂuctuations of the up- stream velocity-pressure ﬂuctuations and acoustic waves act on the ﬂame only in an indirect manner, as they cause ﬂuctuations of the upstream velocity. Contribution: I implemented the coupling of the low Mach simulation and the acoustic network model. I conducted the low Mach simulations and wrote most parts of the manuscript.

Abstract: Artiﬁcial neural networks are a popular nonlinear model structure and are known to be able to describe complex nonlinear phenomena. This arti- cle investigates the capability of artiﬁcial neural networks to serve as a basis for deducing nonlinear low-order models of the dynamics of a laminar ﬂame from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The methodology can be interpreted as an extension of the CFD/system identiﬁcation approach: a CFD simulation of the ﬂame is perturbed with a broadband, high-amplitude signal and the resulting ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate and of the reference velocity are recorded. Thereafter, an artiﬁcial neural network is identiﬁed based on the time series collected. Five data sets that differ in amplitude distribution and length were generated for the present study. Based on each of these data sets, a parameter study was conducted by varying the structure of the artiﬁcial neural network. A general ﬁt-value criterion is applied and the 10 artiﬁcial neu- ral networks with the highest ﬁt values are selected. Comparing of these 10 ar- tiﬁcial neural networks allows to obtain information on the uncertainty encoun- tered. It is found that the methodology allows to capture the forced response of the ﬂame reasonably well. The validation against the forced response, however, depends strongly on the forcing signal used. Therefore, an additional validation criterion is investigated. The artiﬁcial neural networks are coupled with a ther- moacoustic network model. This allows to model self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. If the training time series are sufﬁciently long, this coupled model allows to predict the trend of the root mean square values of ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate. However, the prediction of the maximal value of the ﬂuctuation amplitude is poor. Another drawback found is that even if very long- time series are available, the behaviour of artiﬁcial neural networks cannot be guaranteed. It is concluded that more sophisticated nonlinear low-order models are necessary. Contribution: I conducted the parameter study, implemented the coupling be- tween artiﬁcial neural networks and the acoustic network models and wrote most of the manuscript.

Tud- isco et al use CBSBC to investigate the Continuously Variable Resonance Combustor (CVRC) rig located at Purdue University. The rig is a single injec- tor rocket engine type combustor. With CBSBC it should also be possible to model the inﬂuence of Helmholtz resonators and dissipative liners in LES of gas turbine combustion chambers. The methods are also expected to improve combustion noise simulations. The noise measured from a real ﬂame depends strongly on the acoustic boundary conditions. This can be modeled via CB- SBC. With the hybrid low-Mach formulation proposed it should, in theory, be possible to simulate combustion noise with an incompressible simulation. In the FVV follow-up project ROLEX 12 it is planned to use the hybrid formulations to model annular and multi-can combustors of modern gas turbines. Other possible applications are thermoacoustic engines or HV AC systems. CBSBC can be applied as long as the waves impinging on the boundary condi- tions are plane. The limitation of the hybrid low-Mach model is the compactness assumption of the heat source. Further effort should be spent to overcome these limitations. As the computational effort of the hybrid models is still considerable, methods to build nonlinear low-order models of the ﬂame dynamics in a general and con- sistent way are required. In the scope of this thesis, in P APER -ANN, artiﬁcial neural networks have been used to extend the CFD/SI approach to the nonlin- ear regime. Unfortunately, a high uncertainty of amplitudes of thermoacoustic oscillations predicted was observed. Hence, more sophisticated methods are re- quired. One way to improve the results are white- or grey-box models, which account for the physics of the ﬂame more accurately. Another idea is to use not only the time series of the input and output signal to identify the model, but also 12 Hybrid Reduced Order / LES Models of self-e Xcited Combustion Instabilities in Multi-Burner Systems ﬁeld data. This allows to use more information to build the models which should reduce the length of the time series required. These models should be validated in the systematic procedure proposed in PAPER -ANN. Bibliography W.

In this context, one distinguishes between black -box and grey-box models. The former rely on time series data only and do not require any physical modeling of the system that is to be identified. The latter exploit prior knowledge of the system physics to some extent and in this sense are physically motivated. For the c ase of a flame stabilized in a duct, a grey -box model is formulated that comprises an acoustic part as well as sub-models for the flame dynamics and the jump conditions for acoustic variables across the region of heat release. Each of the subsystems ca n be modeled with or without physical a priori knowledge, in combination they yield a model for the scattering behavior of the flame. We demonstrate these concepts by analyzing a CFD model of a laminar conical premixed flame. The grey -box approach allows to optimize directly the scattering behavior of the identified model. Furthermore, we show that the method allows to estimate heat release rate fluctuations as well as the flame transfer function from acoustic measurements only.

They go along with high fluctuations of pressure and heat release rate and therefore, can lead to a significant reduction of the life time of the engine. Due to the today limited computational capacities it is not possible to simulate a whole gas turbine with CFD in order to A.1 P APER -GREY BOX S. Jaensch, T. Emmert, C. F. Silva, and W.

Instead, the gas turbin e is divided into several subsystems and a low-order model for each of the subsystems is determined. Then, all low-order models are connected in order to predict the stability of the whole system. This type of model s is called “thermoacoustic network model ” [2–6]. Point of discussion of the present study is the low -order modeling of the acoustic scattering behavior of a flame stabilized in a duct. This is the relationship between acoustic waves that are impinging on a flame and the resulting reflected and transmitted acoustic waves. The state of the art ansatz is to combine the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions with the flame transfer function (FTF). Thereby, t he Rankine -Hugoniot equations represent the linearized, one dimensional momentum and energy equations evaluated over the flame. They relate the incoming and outgoing acoustic waves with the fluctuation of the global heat release rate. The FTF closes the equations by relating the velocity fluctuation at a reference position with the fluctuation of the heat release rate. We can distinguish between two different types of models used for the FTF. On the one hand there are analytic models like the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model [8–10]. On the other hand the FTF can be determined with an approach that combines CFD simulations with system identification (SI) techniques. Thereby, at first the CFD model is excited with broadband signals in order to generate data. Afterwards, the SI methods are used to derive models from the time series. This approach is called CFD/SI approach and was originally proposed in. The part of the identification does not require any physical assumptions and therefore, is a black-box approach. As we will see grey-box modeling establishes a connection between the analytical white-box models and the black-box modeling of the CFD/SI approach. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First an overview of thermoacoustic network models and the basic theory of system identification is provided. Th en the modelling of the scattering matrix of an acoustic flame element is analyzed from a system theoretic perspective and different models of the flame dynamics are discussed. Finally, the approach is validated using a CFD model of a laminar premixed conical flame. THERMOACOUSTIC NETWORK MODELS This section gives a brief overview on the modeling of thermoacoustic networks, as it is used in the paper. The classical modeling of acoustic networks is in frequency domain. An alternative way of the modeling is based on state-space models in the time domain. It is possible to show that both formulations are equivalent. Further details on t he implementation used in the present work are given in. The modeling of t he acoustic network is based on the assumption of plane waves. This is justified, as the cross section length of the acoustic elements is muc h smaller than the characteristic wavelength relevant in those systems. In order to obtain a causal formulation of the acoustic network, the acoustic perturbations are formulated throughout the paper in terms of the characteristic wave amplitudes 𝑓 and 𝑔. They are defined as 𝑓 = 1 2( 𝑝′ 𝜌̅ 𝑐̅ + 𝑢′),𝑔 = 1 2 ( 𝑝′ 𝜌̅ 𝑐̅ − 𝑢′) ( 1 ) with the fluctuation of pressure 𝑝′ and of velocity 𝑢′ and the mean density 𝜌̅ and speed of sound 𝑐̅. Acoustic elements like d ucts, area jumps and flames are described by their corresponding scattering system s. In an abstract way it is given as 𝑮𝑆:[𝑔1 𝑓1 ] ↦ [𝑓2 𝑔2 ] ( 2 ) As shown in Figure 1 it relates the acoustic waves upstream and downstream of the element. We omit entropy waves because entropy waves generated by the flame couple with acoustic perturbations only in regions of strong mean flow acceleration, which are not discussed in the present work. However, the presented framework can be extended without essential difficulty to account for this effect. Commonly, a scattering system is expressed in terms of the scattering matrix. We use the terminology “system” to point out that we describe a dynamic relationship between the input output signals and that it is unnecessary to restrict oneself to the frequency domain or to a specific model structure. For elements like ducts and area jumps analytic expressions for the scattering systems exist. Scattering systems of complex elements can be derived from experiments or from CFD. In the latter case two main approaches are used : On the one hand solvers based on a linearized formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and on the other hand solvers based on the full Navier -Stokes equations. The present study considers the determination of the scattering systems from fully compressible CFD s imulations. Here, the computationally most efficient method is the CFD/SI approach [11,16–18]. The approach forms the basis for this work and therefore, is discussed in the subsequent sections. SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION With SI we can derive dynamical models from time series data. Within this section we explain the general procedure, which consists of three steps: collection of the time series data, selection of the model structure and the determination of the unknown parameters of the model [19–21].

Data Acquisition The first step is the collection of the data. For a given experimental setup or, as in the present case, a CFD simulation one first defines the input s and output s of interest. When the scattering system is to be identified, the inputs and the output s are the incoming and outgoing acoustic waves, resp ectively. Afterwards, input signals are designed in order to make the experiment as informative as possible. One requirement is to excite all frequencies of interest with an amplitude as high as possible, i.e. without bringing the amplitude to levels where non- linear effects are important. When the experiment has more than one input channel, the data is more informative if the correlation of the input signals of each channel is low. The input signals used for the present study are given in and meet these requirements. Selection of the Model Structure The second step is the selection of the model structure. As shown in Figure 2, a dynamical model describes the relationship between the 𝑛𝜐 input signals 𝜐𝑖 and the estimates of the 𝑛𝑦 output signals 𝑦̂𝑗. The mapping is described by a function 𝑓(𝝊,𝚯). Here, 𝚯 is the vector of unknown parameters that are to be determined during the identification process. Within this work we consider the function 𝑓(𝝊,𝚯) to be linear. A general description for linear models is given by the so called transfer function notation 𝑦̂𝑗(𝑡) = ∑ 1 + 𝑎1,𝑖,𝑗𝑞−1 + ⋯+ 𝑎𝑛𝑎,𝑖,𝑗𝑞 −𝑛𝑎𝑖,𝑗 𝑏0,𝑖,𝑗 + 𝑏1,𝑖,𝑗𝑞−1 + ⋯+ 𝑏𝑛𝑏,𝑖,𝑗𝑞 −𝑛𝑏𝑖,𝑗 𝑛𝜐 𝑖=1 𝜐𝑖(𝑡) ( 3 ) where 𝑞 is the time-shift operator, and 𝑎𝑘,𝑖,𝑗 and 𝑏𝑘,𝑖,𝑗 are the coefficients of the polynomials. An equivalent formulation is the state space structure. It is given as [𝒙(𝑡 + 𝛥𝑡) 𝒚̂(𝑡) ] = [𝑨 𝑩 𝑪 𝑫][𝒙(𝑡) 𝝊(𝑡)] ( 4 ) Here, 𝒙(𝑡) ∈ ℝ𝑛 is the state vector, 𝒚̂(𝑡) and 𝝊(𝑡) are the vectorized output and input signals as given in Figure 2, Δ𝑡 is the sampling time and 𝑨, 𝑩, 𝑪,and 𝑫 are the system matrices of appropriate size. The integer 𝑛 denotes the order of the system. The parameters for this type of model are the coefficients of the system matrices. A model structure commonly used for the CFD/SI approach is the finite impulse response (FIR) model, it is given as 𝑦̂𝑗(𝑡) = ∑ ∑ ℎ𝑘,𝑖,𝑗𝜐𝑖(𝑡 − 𝑘𝛥𝑡) 𝐿𝑖,𝑗 𝑘=0 𝑛𝜐 𝑖=1 ( 5 ) The unknown parameters for this model structure are the coefficients of the impulse response ℎ𝑘,𝑗. 𝐿𝑖 is the length of the impulse response. With 𝑗 = 1,…,𝑛𝑦 equation ( 5 ) describes an FIR model with 𝑛𝜐 inputs and 𝑛𝑦 outputs. The FIR model ( 5 ) is a simplification of transfer function model ( 3 ) and the state space model ( 4 ). For the transfer function model this can easily be seen by setting the parameters to 𝑎𝑘,𝑖,𝑗 = ℎ𝑘,𝑖,𝑗, 𝑏0,𝑖,𝑗 = 1, 𝑏𝑘≠0,𝑖,𝑗 = 0 and 𝐿𝑖,𝑗 = 𝑛𝑎𝑖,𝑗. For the state -space model one ca n show that if all eigen values o f the Matrix 𝑨 are equal to zero, the state space model has a finite impulse response and hence, is an FIR model. Throughout the paper we separate between black-box, grey- box and white box models as follows. When we use a black-box model, only the input and output signals of the model have a physical meaning and we do not have any insight regarding the mechanisms leading to the specific relationship between these signals. Mathematically the model can be described as a sta te- space model where all coefficients of the system matrices are to be estimated by system identification routines. A Grey-box models uses some physical knowledge to determine the model structure. This means that some of the parameters of the system matrices are known from physical considerations and the remaining parameters are identified. As we will show later on the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model may be considered as an example of a grey- box model. Accordingly, a white-box model is a model where all parameters are known from physical considerations and none of the parameters is identified. Determination of the Parameters The last step is to determine the unknown parameters of the model. Therefore, we define an optimization problem based on the least squares approach. The parameters are determined by minimizing the cost function 𝑉(𝜣) = ∑ 𝑒(𝑘 𝛥𝑡,𝜣)2 𝑁 𝑘=1 ( 6 ) with the length of the time series 𝑁 and the prediction error 𝑒(𝑡) = 𝑦(𝑡) − 𝑦̂(𝑡,𝚯). Hereby, 𝑦(𝑡) and 𝑦̂(𝑡,𝚯) are the measured and the estimated output, respectively. If the model is an FIR filter, the resulting optimization problem can be solved analytically and is known as the Wiener -Hopf equation. For a general state-space model the optimization can only be solved using iterative algorithms. Wills and Ninness give an overview over these algorithms. As long simulation times are very expensive, the time series used in the CFD/SI approach are typically very short. In this case Figure 2: General dynamical model 𝜐1 𝑦̂1 𝜐𝑛𝜐 𝑦̂𝑛𝑦 𝑓(𝒖,𝚯) ⋮ ⋮ A.1 P APER -GREY BOX S. Jaensch, T. Emmert, C. F. Silva, and W.

Reprinted with permission from ASME. the quality of the identified model can be improved by regularization. Thereby, the cost function 𝑉(𝚯) is extended to 𝑉(𝜣) = ∑ 𝑒(𝑘 𝛥𝑡,𝜣)2 𝑁 𝑘=1 + 𝜆𝜣𝑇𝜣 ( 7 ) with the regularization parameter 𝜆. A study on the influence of the regularization to the CFD/SI approach is given in. Chen et. al. discuss different ways to interpret regularization using the example of the FIR model. FROM BLACK-BOX TO WHITE-BOX MODELLING In this section we analyze the modelling of a thermoacoustic flame element from a system theoretic perspective. We start with a black-box model that does not require any physical knowledge. Then we show that physical relationships allow us to split the black-box model into several subsystems with different physical interpretation. At first we model each of these subsystems again as black-box model. Afterwards, we discuss how the subsystem representing the flame dynamics can be modeled. Black-box Modeling of the Scattering System Using the black-box approach we see the scattering system as shown in Figure 1. We know th e physical meaning of inputs and outputs and the black-box identification provides the transfer behavior between them. However, we do not get an understanding of the physical mechanisms that lead to the specific scattering behavior. Grey-box Modeling of the Scattering System The following derivation of the scattering system is motivated by the analysis in. In the grey-box approach the scattering system of the flame is seen as shown in Figure 3. The schematic diagram in Figure 4 represents the same configuration in a more abstract way. Here, the whole system is separated into three subsystems: 1) the system 𝑮𝐹 describing the dynamic s of the flame, 2) the system 𝑮𝐴 describing the acoustic part and 3) the system 𝑮𝐽𝐶 describing the jump condition over the flame. Each of these subsystems is discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section. The system 𝑮𝐹 represents the dynamics of the flame. It links the velocity fluctuation 𝑢′ at a reference position to the fluctuation of the global heat release 𝑞̇′. We def ine the corresponding system as 𝑮𝐹:𝑢′ ⟼ 𝑞̇′ ( 8 ) Secondly, t he acoustic system 𝑮𝐴 describes the dynamic behavior of the acoustic waves. Its main components are the scattering systems 𝑮𝑺 𝑢 and 𝑮𝑺 𝑑 of the acoustic elements upstream and downstream of the flame, respectively. The upstream scattering system 𝑮𝑺 𝑢, linking the acoustic waves upstream of the flame position, is given as 𝑮𝑺 𝑢:[𝑓1 𝑔2 ] ⟼ [𝑔1 𝑓2 ] ( 9 ) According to Figure 3 this scattering system represents a duct/area-jump configuration. The corresponding transfer behavior of the system can be determined in manifold ways, e.g. by the CFD/SI approach or by analytical modelling. In analogy the downstream scattering system 𝑮𝑺 𝑑:[𝑓3 𝑔4 ] ⟼ [𝑔3 𝑓4 ] ( 10 ) relates the acoustic waves traveling on the downstream side of the flame. For the reference velocity we define the following expression 𝑢′ = 𝑓1 − 𝑔1 ( 11 ) Finally, the acoustic system 𝑮𝐴 is retrieved by assembling ( 9 ) to ( 11 ) and is given as 𝑮𝐴:[ 𝑔2 𝑓3 𝑓1 𝑔4 ] ⟼ [ 𝑔1 𝑓4 𝑔3 𝑓2 𝑢′] ( 12 ) Figure 3: Grey-box model for the scattering behavior of a flame stabilized in a duct Figure 4: Schematic diagram of the configuration from Figure 3 𝑞̇′ 𝑔1 𝑓1 𝑔4 𝑓4 + − 𝑮𝐹 𝑢′ duct area jump flame duct reference position 𝑮𝐴 𝑓1,𝑔4 𝑔1,𝑓4 𝑮𝐹 𝑮𝐽𝐶 𝑢′ 𝑞̇′ 𝑓2,𝑔3 𝑔2,𝑓3 A.1 P APER -GREY BOX S.

The system 𝑮𝐽𝐶 represents the jump condition over the flame and closes the formulation. It relates the following properties 𝑮𝐽𝐶:[ 𝑓2 𝑔3 𝑞̇′ ] ⟼ [𝑔2 𝑓3 ] ( 13 ) A specific structure of this system can be derived from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump equations. Grey-box Modeling of the Flame Dynamics In the previous section the flame is treate d as black -box model. However, there a re different grey -box and white -box models for the flame dynamic s. As a n FIR model it can be described as 𝑮𝐹: 𝑞̇′(𝑡) = ∑ ℎ𝑘𝑢′(𝑡 − 𝑘𝛥𝑡) 𝐿 𝑘=0 ( 14 ) with the sampling time Δ𝑡 and the coefficients of the impulse response ℎ𝑘. From a system theoretic point of view the FIR model is typically seen as black -box model. However, Blumenthal et. al. show that a linearized G-equation model of the flame has indeed a finite impulse response. Furthermore, it can be shown that the flame response can be discussed in terms of perturbations, which are convected along the flame front with distributed time delays. The FIR model also a ccounts for this effect, thus it should be considered as grey-box model of the flame. The 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model is a further grey-box model for the flame dynamics. It can be derived from the FIR model. Thereby, the coefficients of the FIR model ( 14 ) are calculated according to ℎ𝑘 = 𝛥𝑡 𝜎√2𝜋 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−1 2(𝑘𝛥𝑡 − 𝜏 𝜎 ) ) ( 15 ) Here, 𝜏 and 𝜎 are the unknown parameters that are to be identified. The occurrence of the time step Δ𝑡 in equation ( 15 ) is discussed in the appendix. The 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model is a parameterization of the FIR model and reduces the number of unknown parameters from 𝐿 to 2. This helps to interpret the model. If both o f these parameters are determined by analytic equations, we obtain a white-box model of the flame. APPLICATION TO A LAMINAR PREMIXED FLAME In this section we use the grey -box modeling to investigate a 2 D CFD simulation of a laminar premixed flame. At first we show the CFD setup and discuss the network model. Afterwards we discuss the results of the identification. CFD Setup The CFD configuration is based on an experiment from Le Helley. This experiment was studi ed numerically in and. With the exception of the inflow and outflow boundary conditions (BCs), we use the 2 D CFD model shown in utilizing the CFD solver AVBP. With Plane wave masking we obtain boundaries with low reflection. The geometry is shown in Figure 5 and was discretized using a mesh with a minimum cell s ize of about 3.042 ⋅ 10−15 𝑚3. At the inlet we impose a stoichiometric propane -air mixture at 300 𝐾 with a mean velocity of 4𝑚/𝑠. The intake walls are adiabatic non slip walls whereas the chamber walls are modeled as adiabatic slip walls. In a cross validation study three simulations with different ways of excitation were performed. One simulation with excitation from upstream (case Exu), one with excitation from downstream (case Exd) and one with a simultaneous excitation at both sides of the flame (case Exu,d). The excitation signal in all cases was a broadband wavelet signal proposed in. In the case Exu,d with simultaneous excitation both input signals were statistically independent. In all cases the outgoing acoustic waves as well as the fluctuation of the heat release rate were measured as output signals. Each simulation was run for 0.002𝑠. Using a sampling interval of 2.02 ⋅ 10−5𝑠 this provides 899 data samples. The characteristic time scale 𝜏𝑐 of the configuration is given as 𝜏𝑐 = 2𝑅 𝑢̅ 𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝛼) = 0.07141𝑚𝑠 ( 16 ) Here, 𝑅 = 0.065𝑚𝑚 is the radius, 𝑢̅ = 4𝑚/𝑠 is the inlet velocity and 𝛼 = 13.0536° is the flame angle. This time scale is used to normalize all frequencies and times in the subsequent part of this work.

Direct Identification of the Flame Dynamics Direct identification of the flame dynamics means to identify the system 𝑮𝐹 from the time series of the velocity fluctuations and of the heat release fluctuation. In the previous section we introduced the FIR model and the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model as a grey-box model for the flame. In this section we use the collected time series of velocity and of the heat release rate fluctuation to directly estimate the unknown parameters of the flame models. For the identification of the FIR model we use the Wiener-Hopf inversion. The unknown pa rameters of the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model are determined in the following way. We start with an initial guess of the parameters and calculate the coefficients ℎ𝑘 of the impulse response according to equation ( 15 ). Using this guess and the collected time series of the velocity fluctuation, we can calculate an estimate of the heat release fluctuation with equation ( 14 ). With this estimate we can evaluate the cost function ( 6 ). In order to minimize the cost function we use the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. We used an FIR model with 50 coefficients. The estimated values of the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model are 𝜏/𝜏𝑐 = 0.09831 and 𝜎/𝜏𝑐 = 0.02597. In Figure 6 amplitude and phase of the estimated FTF are shown. Polifke and Lawn showed that the low frequency limit of the gain of the FTF of a premixed flame is equal to one. As this knowledge was used to derive the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model, the model exactly fulfills this condition whereas the FIR model slightly violates is. Both models exhibit a linearly decreasing phase angle. This is in agreement with the analytic G-equation model from Schuller et al. Identification of the Scattering System As aforementioned, we can model the scattering system of the flame with a black-box and a grey-box ansatz. The grey-box ansatz is very general and consists of several subsystems, which again have to be modeled themselves. For the acoustic subsystem 𝑮𝐴 we need models for the scattering systems 𝑮𝑺 𝑢 and 𝑮𝑺 𝑑. According to Figure 3, the scattering system 𝑮𝑺 𝑢, which relates the acoustic waves upstream of the flame, has to represent a duct-area jump configuration. For the present study we model the duct as a time delay and the area jump as a static gain. However, due to the abstract formulation of the problem the use of less simplistic models for the scattering system is straight forward. The scattering system 𝑮𝑺 𝑑 for the waves downs tream of the flame we use a simple time delay model. To model the system 𝑮𝐽𝐶 we use the Rankine -Hugoniot equations in order to describe this system. In state -space form they are given as 𝑮𝑅𝐻:[𝑔2 𝑓3 ] = 1 𝜁 + 1[1 − 𝜁 2 𝜗𝑢̅1 2𝜁 𝜁 − 1 𝜗𝜁𝑢̅1 ] [ 𝑓2 𝑔3 𝑞̇′ ] ( 17 ) with ζ = ρ̅2 c̅2 ρ̅3 c̅3 and ϑ = T 3 T 2 − 1, where ρ̅ denotes the mean density, c̅ the mean speed of sound, T the temperature and 𝑢̅1 the mean velocity at position 1. The position of the indices is shown in Figure 3. Here again, we use of the Rankine -Hugoniot equations because they describe the investigated configuration sufficiently well. However, the framework allows to consider more complex models for the jump conditions as well. This may be useful when non-compact flames are investigated. Finally, we need a model for the system 𝑮𝐹 describing the dynamics of the flame. We introduced the FIR model and the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model. As the results for both models are very similar we only show the results for the FIR model in this section. The analytic models for the system 𝑮𝐴 and 𝑮𝐽𝐶 require only parameters that depend on the geometry and on the mean flow properties. Therefore, the unknown parameters of the grey -box model are the coefficients of the impulse response ℎ𝑘. For these parameters we can either use the estimate we obtained in the previous section or use a grey-box identification algorithm. The latter approach has the advantage that we can directly optimize the scattering behavior of the identified system. Furthermore, it does not require the collected time series of the heat release fluctuation. This is an advantage when experimentally determined time series are analyzed because the measurement of fluctuations of heat release rate with quantitative accuracy is in general very diffi cult. The procedure of the grey-box identification is similar to the identification of the parameters of the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model. We start with an initial guess f or th e coefficients ℎ𝑘. This guess has to fulfill the requirement that the resulting model is stable. Now, by simulating the model with the time series of the incoming acoustic waves, we obtain an estimate of the time series of the outgoing acoustic waves. This enables us to evaluate the cost function ( 6 ). Using the state - space representation of the grey -box model, we can directly Figure 6: Identified FTF.

Reprinted with permission from ASME. apply the algorithms discussed in in order to find parameters that minimize the cost function. In Figure 7 the resulting estimate of the scattering system are shown in terms of the estimated gain of the scattering matrix. Here, the scattering matrix is defined as 𝑮𝑆:[𝑔1 𝑓4 ] = [𝑆11 𝑆12 𝑆21 𝑆22 ][𝑓1 𝑔4 ] ( 18 ) We compare the following identification results: 1. A black-box estimate using a n FIR filter with 150 coefficients for each entry of the scattering matrix. In order to obtain the full scattering matrix on this way from a single CFD run, we have to excite the domain simultaneously from the inlet an d the outlet. Therefore, the results shown were based on the data set Exu,d. 2. A combination of the grey-box model and the FTF that was directly estimated fro m velocity and heat release fluctuations. This approach allows to determine the full scattering matrix from a CFD run excited only at the inlet or from the outlet. For the results shown in Figure 7 we used the data from CFD case Exu, which was excited from the inlet only. 3. We use the grey-box identification routine. This allows us to use our physical understanding of the problem and yet, to directly identify the scatter ing behavior of the system. Also this approach allows to determine the full scattering matrix from a single CFD run, which was excited only fr om the inlet or the outlet. In order to perform a cross validation, we used the third data set Exd, which was excited from the outlet only. Each of the models shown in Figure 7 were calculated using a different data set. Nevertheless, a ll estimates are in good agreement. However, there are oscillations in the curve of the black-box FIR model. The reason is that the black-box model has 600 unknown parameters, whereas the grey-box model has only 50 parameters. The high number of unknown parameters of the FIR model is necessary, as the black-box model has to model the dynamic of the acoustic and of the flame simultaneously. Therefore, the black-box identification of the FIR model requires much longer time series for the same accuracy. Indirect Identification of the Flame Dynamics As noted in the previous section, the grey-box identification of the scattering system does not require the time series of the heat release fluctuation. Nevertheless, we obtain an estimate of the impulse response coefficients. Therefore, we can indirectly estimate the flame dynamic s. The resulting estimate of the impulse response is plotted in Figure 8. As the first ten parameters of the impulse response could only poorly be estimated, they were fixed to zero. We can obtain an estimate 𝑞̇̂′ of the time series of the heat release rate fluctuations by imposing the measured velocity fluctuation to the identified system 𝑮𝐹. In table 1, the real and the estimated heat release fluctuations are compared in terms of the normalized root mean square error, also known as fit value, which is given as fit = 100 (1 − ‖𝑞̇′ − 𝑞̇̂′‖ ‖𝑞̇′‖ ) ( 19 ) As expected, the highest values are achieved by the direct identification. However, inverting the Rankine -Hugoniot equations by the use of the grey-box identification routine gives almost the same estimate without the usage of 𝑞̇′, although the corresponding time series was not used for the estimation. Figure 8 shows that the regularization smooth the resulting estimate of the impulse response. This lea ds according to table 1 to an improvement of about 4% points of the fit value. The regularization parameter 𝜆 was choosen to maximize the fit value for the case Exu,d. The corresponding fit value shows the best improvement we can receive with by regularizing the estimate. Looking at the fit values for the other two regularized cases we can state that the regularization indeed improves the results. However, choosing the regularization parameter in this way is only possible, if the time series of the heat release fluctuation is known. Figure 7: Magnitude of the elements of the scattering matrix.

CONCLUSION The low order modelling of the scattering behavior of a laminar flame stabilized in a duct was analyzed. Starting from a black-box description we showed that the scattering behavior can be represented by three interconnected subsystems. One subsystem models the acoustic part, a second subsystem models the flame dynamic s and third subsystem models the jump condition over the flame. Each of these subsystems can either be identified as a black -box model or be modeled using first principles. This allows to validate physical assumptions separately. The approach was validated by means of a CFD model of a laminar conical flame. We showed that grey-box identification allows to exploit the physical knowledge for the identification. This allows to directly optimize the scattering behavior of the identified system and still use the relationships of the network modelling. Furthermore, the approach allows to indirectly estimate the fluctuation of the heat release rate from the acoustic field. The grey -box approach was introduced in a very general way and therefore, it can easily be extended to more complex configurations. It is also possible to adjust the identification routine depending on the quantity of interest and the data available.

In continuous time the impulse response ℎ̅(𝑡) of the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model is given as ℎ(𝑡) = 1 𝜎√2𝜋 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−1 2(𝑡 − 𝜏 𝜎 ) ) ( 20 ) According to the impulse response characterizes a linear time invariant causal system. The output 𝑞̇′(𝑡) of the system can be calculated by convoluting the input signal 𝑢′(𝑡) with the impulse response ℎ̅(𝑡). This is 𝑞̇′(𝑡) = ∫ ℎ̅(𝜏) ∞ 𝑢′(𝑡 − 𝜏)𝑑𝜏 ( 21 ) Sampling this equation with a time step Δ𝑡 yields after 𝑘 intervals 𝑞̇′(𝑘𝛥𝑡) = ∫ ℎ̅(𝜏) ∞ 𝑢′(𝑘𝛥𝑡 − 𝜏)𝑑𝜏 ( 22 ) Assuming ℎ(𝑡) and 𝑢′(𝑡) to be constant over a time interval Δ𝑡 gives 𝑞̇′(𝑘𝛥𝑡) ≈ ∑ ℎ̅(𝑘𝛥𝑡)𝑢′(𝑘𝛥𝑡 − 𝜏)𝛥𝑡 ∞ 𝑘=0 ( 23 ) Comparing the equations ( 14 ) and ( 23 ) the coefficients of the discrete impulse response of the 𝑛 − 𝜏 − 𝜎 model are ℎ𝑘 = ℎ̅(𝑘𝛥𝑡)𝛥𝑡 ( 24 ) This yields the factor Δ𝑡 in equation ( 15 ).

In the present study we discuss time domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC). The formulation proposed allows to impose a desired reﬂection coeﬃcient at the inﬂow and outﬂow boundaries. Our formulation is an extension of the well known Navier–Stokes characteristic boundary conditions. The frequency dependent reﬂections at the boundaries are implemented with a state-space model in the time domain. We provide a comprehensive discussion on how such state- space models can be constructed and interpreted. This discussion shows that the state- space description allows a robust and ﬂexible implementation. It allows to consider complex reﬂection coeﬃcients and account for non-constant CFD time steps in a straight forward manner. Furthermore, we prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that the formulation proposed is consistent, i.e. the formulation ensures that the ﬂow simulation exhibits the reﬂection coeﬃcient imposed accurately, as long as the waves impinging on the boundary are plane, and it prohibits drift of the mean ﬂow variables. Finally, the boundary conditions are tested successfully for laminar and turbulent ﬂows. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The simulation of unsteady compressible ﬂows in particular by large eddy simulation (LES) or by direct numerical simula- tion (DNS) requires the appropriate modeling of the reﬂection of acoustic waves at the boundaries. Otherwise, the simulation results will be unphysical and will not match experimental data or numerical instabilities occur. Except for some special cases (a chocked inlet, say), the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcient depends on the frequency of the acoustic waves. This de- pendency is a property of the conﬁguration investigated. The boundary conditions discussed in the present work provide a solution to this issue as they allow to impose a frequency dependent reﬂection coeﬃcient. The concept is known as “time domain impedance boundary conditions” (TDIBC). For example, the TDIBC formulation proposed in the present work, can facilitate an LES simulation of a gas turbine combustion chamber, which accounts for the acoustic feedback of compressor and turbine. A sketch of such a conﬁguration and the corresponding LES model is shown in Fig. 1. The combustion chamber is resolved with an LES. Simultaneously, * Corresponding author.

Jaensch et al / Journal of Computational Physics 314 145–159 Fig. 1.Schematic diagram of a gas turbine (top) and the corresponding LES model using a TDIBC formulation (bottom). a TDIBC accounts for the acoustic feedback by imposing the acoustic impedance at the inlet and the outlet. Additionally, turbulence created upstream of the combustion chamber is modeled by a turbulence generator. This modeling reduces the computational costs, signiﬁcantly, and makes an LES of a gas turbine combustion chamber, which accounts for the acoustic feedback, possible even with today’s computational resources. A similar scenario can be considered for rocket engine combustion chambers. Here, the inﬂuence of a large number of injectors can be modeled via a TDIBC formulation, eﬃciently. A TDIBC formulation has to solve two problems: (1) A time-domain model of the frequency dependent reﬂection coef- ﬁcient or of the impedance is required and (2) this model has to be coupled with the ﬂow simulation. The time-domain model has to be robust and ﬂexible so that complex reﬂection coeﬃcients can be modeled with a reasonable effort. The coupling of the ﬂow simulation and the time-domain model has to ensure that the formulation is consistent. This means that the ﬂow simulation exhibits the reﬂection coeﬃcient imposed, accurately, without introducing artiﬁcial reﬂections, and that drift of the mean ﬂow variables is avoided. Furthermore, the TDIBC should not constrain the ﬂow simulation, e.g. by requiring a constant time step. In the present work we review existing TDIBC formulations and propose a formulation that is robust, ﬂexible and consistent at the same time. The time-domain model can either model the acoustic impedance or the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcient. The former relates primitive acoustic variables and the latter uses characteristic wave amplitudes. One can show that formally both expressions are equivalent. For TDIBC a time-domain model of one of the expressions is required. Several authors [1–9] suggested to apply an inverse Laplace- or z-transform to the reﬂection coeﬃcient or the impedance. This yields a convolution integral in the time domain, which can be integrated in a CFD code. Schuermans et al proposed, independently, to use discrete-time state-space models. State-space models are inherently causal, numerically more robust and more ﬂexible. Furthermore, as discussed in section 4.01, they allow a physical meaningful interpretation. The coupling of the time-domain model with the ﬂow simulation can be done based on primitive variables or on charac- teristic wave amplitudes. Formulations based on primitive variables use a, possible simpliﬁed, version of Myers’s condition in the time domain in combination with a time-domain model for the impedance. These formulations work well for solvers of perturbation equations. However, when applied as inﬂow or outﬂow boundary condition (BC) to an LES or DNS this coupling yields drift of the mean variables. Therefore, Schuermans et al proposed to stabilize the sim- ulation with a high pass ﬁlter. This method was also utilized by Huber et al. However, as we will show analytically in the present work, it yields an incorrect reﬂection coeﬃcient for low frequencies. Kaess et al proposed to extend “plane wave masking” (PWM) to a TDIBC. PWM itself is an extension of the low-reﬂective Navier–Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBC). It minimizes the reﬂection of plane acoustic waves propagating in the direction per- pendicular to the boundary surface. Therefore, this formulation is suitable for conﬁgurations which are ducted in the region close to the boundary condition (see Fig. 2). In this case waves with a frequency below the cut-off frequency of the ﬁrst higher order mode are plane. In the present work we combine the formulation of Kaess et al with state-space description of the reﬂection coeﬃ- cient as proposed by Schuermans et al. Therefore, we call the BC proposed Characteristic Based State-space Boundary Condition (CBSBC). We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that when PWM is used for the coupling drift is avoided and the ﬂow simulation exhibits the reﬂection behavior imposed, accurately. We show that the coupling based on primitive variables yields drift of the mean ﬂow variables and that the use of a high pass ﬁlter avoids the drift but yields incorrect results for low frequencies. In contrast to we use continuous time state-space models this allows to use non- constant time steps in a straight forward manner. Furthermore, we propose to use a state-space model with two inputs. The ﬁrst input is the characteristic amplitude of the outgoing wave and the second input is an external excitation signal. The latter allows e.g. to consider a loud speaker or a turbulent noise source inside the region of the acoustic model. We demonstrate by a numerical example that CBSBC works well with unstable state-space models. We discuss how state-space models can be determined in most practically relevant situations.

To the best of our knowledge the formulation proposed should work also with implicit pressure-based codes. The paper is organized as follows: In the next section we recapitulate the separation of the ﬂow variables in mean ﬁeld and turbulent and acoustic ﬂuctuation. In section 3 we recall NSCBC and PWM. How PWM can be extended to TDIBC is shown in section 4. In subsection 4.01 we give a comprehensive introduction to the modeling of the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcients in the state-space form. The advantages of the state-space formulation are discussed in subsection 4.02. In sub- section 4.03 we provide a pseudo-code example of CBSBC. In subsection 4.04 the properties of the BC proposed and of other formulations are discussed. Finally, in section 5 we illustrate the theory discussed in the previous sections with numerical examples and demonstrate that CBSBC works well for laminar as well as for turbulent ﬂows. 2. Plane acoustic waves As shown in Fig. 2, we consider conﬁgurations that are ducted in regions close to the inlet/outlet BC at which CBSBC are applied. In these conﬁgurations waves with a frequency lower then the cut-off frequency of the ﬁrst higher order mode will be plane. In this situation the ﬂow ﬁeld can be separated in p(t,x, y, z) = ¯p(x, y, z) + p′ T(t,x, y, z) + p′ A(t,x), (1 a) u(t,x, y, z) = ¯u(x, y, z) + u′ T(t,x, y, z) + u′ A(t,x), (1 b) with pressure p and velocity u. Variables with bar (¯ ·) are temporal averaged ﬁelds and the indexes “T” and “A” denote the turbulent and the acoustic ﬂuctuations, respectively. The argument t is the time and x, y, z are spatial coordinates as given in Fig. 2. Please note, as we assumed that only plane waves are propagating the acoustic ﬂuctuation depends only on time and axial coordinate (along the length of the duct section). Plane acoustic waves can be described by the characteristic wave amplitudes f and g f = 1 (p′ A ¯ρ¯c + u′ A ), g = 1 (p′ A ¯ρ¯c − u′ A ). (2) Here, ρ and c are the density and the speed of sound, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, f corresponds to the wave traveling in downstream direction and g is traveling in upstream direction. In order to determine f and g from a compressible ﬂow simulation we have to determine the acoustic ﬂuctuations p′ A and u′ A. As the spatial correlation length of the turbulent ﬂuctuations is very small these ﬂuctuations vanish if a spatial average is applied. Therefore, the acoustic ﬂuctuations are given as p′ A = ⟨p − ¯p⟩, (3 a) u′ A = ⟨u − ¯u⟩. (3 b) Here, ⟨·⟩ represents a spatial average of a plane perpendicular to the traveling direction of the acoustic waves. For highly turbulent ﬂows this area average might not be suﬃcient. The separation can be improved with characteristic based ﬁltering (CBF). At ﬁrst f and g are determined locally at n planes, which are perpendicular to the traveling direction of the acoustic wave. Considering the time lags resulting form the speed of propagation of the waves one can average over the local values of f and g f(t,x) = 1 n n−1∑ i=0 f ( t + /Delta 1 xi ¯c + ¯u,x+ /Delta 1 xi ), (4 a) g(t,x) = 1 n n−1∑ i=0 g ( t − /Delta 1 xi ¯c − ¯u,x+ /Delta 1 xi ).

As demonstrated in, this additional ﬁltering allows to determine f and g in highly turbulent ﬂows. For the reminder of this work ⟨·⟩ denotes an CBF average, which simpliﬁes to a plane average for n = 1. 3. Non-reﬂective BC with plane wave masking The boundary conditions proposed in the present work are based on plane wave masking (PWM). Therefore, we recapitulate PWM in the present section. The NSCBC framework deﬁnes the boundary conditions for pressure and velocity as ∂p ∂t + 1 ¯ρ¯c(L 5 + L 1) = 0, ∂u ∂t + 1 2 (L 5 − L 1) = 0. (5) Here, L 1 and L 5 are locally (on the boundary patch) deﬁned derivatives of the characteristic wave amplitudes traveling in the up- and downstream direction, respectively. A spatial average over the L-waves yields the derivatives of f and g ∂ f ∂t = 1 2 ⟨L 5⟩, ∂g ∂t = 1 2 ⟨L 1⟩. (6) Using the original NSCBC a low-reﬂective outﬂow BC can be constructed as follows. L 5 leaves the domain and can be determined from the internal ﬁeld L 5 = (u + c) (∂p ∂x + ρc∂u ∂x ). (7) L 1 is entering the domain and has to be imposed L 1 = σ ¯ρ¯c (p − p∞), (8) with the desired pressure at the outﬂow p∞. σ is the relaxation parameter and the term (p − p∞) is known as linear relaxation term. An inﬂow boundary condition can be constructed on a similar way. This BC is partially reﬂective. As shown by Selle et al and Polifke et al the resulting reﬂection coeﬃcient R(ω) is a ﬁrst-order low pass ﬁlter R(ω) = ˆgd ˆfd = −1 1+ 2 iω/σ, (9) with the angular frequency ω. The hat ( ˆ · ) labels variables in the frequency domain. The relaxation parameter σ determines the cut-off frequency of the ﬁlter. Using this formulation it is not possible to control phase and magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient independently from each other. A small value of σ yields a low cut-off frequency and thus, lower reﬂections. However, if σ is chosen too low, drift of the mean variables is observed. Polifke et al extended the NSCBC with PWM, in order to minimizes the reﬂection of plane acoustic waves at the bound- aries. The idea is “to identify outgoing plane waves at the boundary, and then explicitly eliminate outgoing wave contributions from the linear relaxation term”. According to PWM the linear relaxation term for a outﬂow BC is modiﬁed L 1 = σ ¯ρ¯c (p − ¯ρ¯c( fd + gx) − p∞) + 2∂gx ∂t. (10) Here, ¯ρ¯c( f + gx) = p′ A represents the acoustic part of the pressure ﬂuctuation. This term compensates any plane-wave acoustic ﬂuctuation at the boundary condition. The external excitation gx is the amplitude of an imposed plane wave entering the domain. As in the NSCBC formulation, the relaxation term of PWM avoids drift of the mean values. PWM yields non-reﬂective boundary conditions, if (1) all waves close to the boundary are plane and (2) one can accurately separate between mean ﬁeld, turbulent ﬂuctuations and acoustic ﬂuctuations. As discussed in section 2 the ﬁrst assumption limits the BC to the low frequency regime and to ducted conﬁgurations. CBF allows to separate the ﬂow ﬁeld, accurately. In summary, one can state that PWM yields very low reﬂection coeﬃcients for plane acoustic waves, as demonstrated in. A non-reﬂective inﬂow boundary condition can be constructed, analogously. Here, the wave L 1 leaves the domain and can be calculated from the internal ﬁeld L 1 = (u − c) (∂p ∂x − ρc∂u ∂x ). (11) According to PWM the ingoing wave L 5 is given as L 5 = σ (u − ( fx − gu) − u T) + 2∂ fx ∂t, (12) where fx is the amplitude of a plane wave imposed at the boundary. A.2 P APER -CBSBC S.

Characteristic based state-space boundary conditions (CBSBC) In the previous section the wave amplitudes fx and gx were considered to be independent external excitation signals. In order to impose a speciﬁc reﬂection behavior this excitation has to be calculated from the characteristic wave leaving the domain according to a proper acoustic model (compare Fig. 3). In the sake of better readability we restrict the discussion in this section to an outﬂow BC. The corresponding expressions for an inﬂow boundary can be derived, analogously. The necessary changes for the implementation are brieﬂy summarized in section 4.03. For many conﬁgurations of practical interest the reﬂection of acoustic waves can be assumed to be linear and causal. Hence, it can be described with a linear state space model ˙x = Ax + B [ fd ex,d ]  u (13 a) gd y = Cx + D [ fd ex,d ]  u (13 b) Here, u denotes the input vector of the model. Its ﬁrst element fd is the amplitude of the wave leaving the CFD-domain. The second element is the external excitation signal ex,d. This signal is also ﬁltered by the state-space model and can describe e.g. an excitation with a loud speaker or turbulent sound production inside the acoustic domain. The output signal y of the acoustic model is the amplitude gd of the wave imposed to the CFD simulation. The matrices A, B, C and D are the state space matrices and x is state vector. The state-space model given in (13) is a complete mathematical representation of any linear causal system. Depending on the choice of the matrices A, B, C and D it can represent, e.g. a linear acoustic solver, a measured reﬂection coeﬃcient or a thermoacoustic network model. The only restriction made by using the (linear) state-space structure as such is its linearity. Therefore, the state-space representation allows a very general implementation of TDIBCs. In the remainder of this section, we will ﬁrst explain by examples how a state-space model for TDIBC can be determined in situations of practical interest. Afterwards, we discuss the advantages of using state-space models compared to other model structures that are found in the literature. Then we present a pseudo code implementation of CBSBC. We conclude the section with a discussion of the properties of CBSBC and other TDIBC formulations found in the literature. 4.01. Examples of state-space models for acoustic boundary conditions In this subsection we give examples how a state-space model for the acoustic can be constructed. The results of this subsection are probably familiar to readers with a profound background in control theory. However, in order to apply the boundary condition proposed in practical application, a good understanding of the state space description of acoustic models is mandatory. Therefore, we discuss in this section how such state space models can be determined and interpreted in detail. The best way to determine the parameters of a state space model depends on the information available. We identify three situations that typically occur: (1) A set of linear partial differential equations (PDE) is known to model the acoustic reﬂections. (2) Measurements of the reﬂection coeﬃcient at several distinct frequencies are available. (3) Different modeling approaches are combined using an acoustic network model as discussed by Schuermans et al and Bothien et al. 4.01.01. State-space models deduced from linear partial differential equations In many situations the reﬂection of acoustic waves is well described by a set of linear PDEs, e.g. the linearized Euler or Navier–Stokes equations. In this subsection we discuss how an exhaust duct can be modeled. This is a pedagogical example of how PDEs can be casted in state space form. The same procedure can be extended to three dimensional PDEs and to more sophisticated discretization schemes. As shown in Fig. 4,t h e exhaust is discretized with a homogeneous one-dimensional mesh. Please compare the notation in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W.

The plane-wave acoustic inside the exhaust section can be modeled with the one dimensional Euler equations. Neglecting mean ﬂow gradients they are given as ∂ f ∂t + (¯u + ¯c) ∂ f ∂x = 0, (14 a) ∂g ∂t + (¯u − ¯c) ∂g ∂x = 0. (14 b) The problem is closed with the boundary conditions f (x= 0,t) = f 1 = fd, (15 a) g(x= L,t) = g N = RL f (x= L,t) + ex,d. (15 b) The meaning of all variables is given in Fig. 4. The Dirichlet boundary condition at x = 0 couples the acoustic model with the CFD simulation. The boundary condition at x = L describes the reﬂection of an acoustic wave at the boundary with a scalar (real valued) reﬂection coeﬃcient RL. Additionally, it models an excitation with an acoustic source ex,d, e.g. a loud speaker. We apply a linear upwind ﬁnite difference scheme for the spatial discretization. This yields for (14 a) ∂ fi ∂t =− (¯u + ¯c) fi − fi−1 /Delta 1 x for i = 2,···, N (16) and for (14 b) ∂gi ∂t =− (¯u − ¯c) gi+1 − gi /Delta 1 x for i = 1, N − 1.

In this form the meaning of the parameters of the state space model becomes evident. The state vector x consists of the values of f and g at the nodes of the mesh. The state matrix A is a linear operator. The elements at the diagonal band are determined by the discretization scheme. The off diagonal element couples the state values f N and gn−1 and thus, describes the reﬂection at the outlet of the resonator. The input matrix B models how the input signal u acts on the temporal derivative of the state vector. Again, its elements are determined by the discretization scheme. All but one element of the output vector C are equal to zero. One element is equal to unity and by multiplying the output vector C with the state vector x one obtains the output signal y = gd. The feed through D is a null vector in the case considered. The corresponding reﬂection coeﬃcient is the transfer function of the state-space model. It can be determined by apply- ing a Laplace transform to equation (19) Rd (s) = ˆgd ˆfd = C (s I − A)−1 B 1. (20) Here, ˆgd and ˆfd denotes the Laplace transform of the respective signals, B 1 is the ﬁrst column vector of B, I the identity matrix and s is the complex frequency. Restricting s to purely imaginary values yields the well known interpretation of the reﬂection coeﬃcient, as the response of the model to a harmonic forcing signal. The result with RL = 1 i s shown in Fig. 5. ω is the real valued angular frequency of the excitation signal. The frequency is normalized by the propagation time of the acoustic signal τ = L ¯c + ¯u + L ¯c − ¯u. (21) In Fig. 5 the results are compared against the analytical solution Rd (s) = e−τs. (22) The ﬁgure shows that the state-space model behaves as an acoustic solver of the one dimensional advection equation which utilizes the ﬁrst order upwind scheme. Looking at the gain one can clearly see the dissipative behavior of the scheme. The error increases with the frequency of the excitation and with the time lag of the resonator. It decreases when a ﬁner grid is chosen. It is interesting to note that the linear upwind scheme captures the phase quite well, which is of particular importance for stability analysis.

The full line ( ) is the excitation signal fd (t). We can also determine the response of the model (19) to a Gaussian impulse signal. For this we consider the state-space model as set of ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is to be discretized in time. Fig. 6 shows the results with a Euler forward scheme and a CFL number of 0.03. Again, the results of the state-space model are identical to the results expected from an acoustic solver of the same problem. Considering that the state-space model is a set of ODEs, it becomes evident that the stability of the state-space model is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The model is stable, if the real part of all eigenvalues is smaller then zero. A exhaust duct, as sketched in the present example, may also be modeled eﬃciently within a LES/DNS by coarsening the mesh towards the outline. This approach, however, has a number of disadvantages compared to a TDIBC. A TDIBC formulation allows to impose an arbitrary reﬂection coeﬃcient at the end of the exhaust and to add an external excitation signal. With the latter one can model e.g. loudspeaker or a turbulent sound source. Furthermore, a TDIBC formulation can also be applied at the inlet. Here, the additional diﬃculty arises that besides the acoustic ﬁeld also a mean velocity proﬁle and possibly turbulence has to be imposed. In particular the imposition of a proper turbulence statistics requires a good mesh. In contrast to TDIBC, a coarse grid cannot maintain these properties, accurately. The main take away message of the example is that a state-space model can be interpreted as a complete and exact representation of an acoustic solver. The procedure can also be applied to a more complex set of PDEs, e.g. the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, and to three dimensional meshes. Modeling errors are introduce due to the choice of a speciﬁc set of PDEs or of a speciﬁc discretization scheme. The state-space representation as such does not introduce any additional error. However, developing suitable models is a time consuming task and the discretization of linearized Navier–Stokes equa- tions is prone to numerical instabilities. As these instabilities are unphysical they will yield unphysical results when imposed as boundary condition. Therefore, in practical application it is often more convenient to determine the model based on mea- sured reﬂection coeﬃcients, as discussed in the next section. 4.01.02. Determining state-space models from measured reﬂection coeﬃcients Often, the reﬂection coeﬃcient is known at several distinct frequencies, e.g. from experimental measurements or from an analytical solution. This information can be used to construct a state space model. For the sake of better readability and without loss of generality, we neglect the source term in this subsection. At ﬁrst we apply an algorithm which ﬁts the coeﬃcients ai and bi of the rational polynomial Rd (s) = ˆgd ˆfd = bnb snb +···+ b 1 s+ b 0 sna + ana−1 sna−1 +···+ a 1 s+ a 0, (23) with na ≥ nb to the complex frequency response. A robust algorithm for this ﬁtting is given in. The next step is to apply the inverse Laplace transform to (23). Considering the relation L ( y[n]) = sn ˆy this yields an ODE of order na g[na] d + ana−1 g[na−1] d +···+ a 1 g d + a 0 gd = bnb f[nb] d +···+ b 1 f d + b 0 fd (24) where g[i] d and f[i] d are the ith temporal derivatives of the respective signals. This ODE can be rewritten in the so-called controllability normal form of a state space model (see e.g. ) A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W. Polifke, Journal of Computational Physics, vol. 314, pp. 145–159, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.jcp.2016.003.0010. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier. S.

The ﬁrst na − 1 l i n e s of (25 a) are trivial. The last line of equation (25 a) and equation (25 b) can be veriﬁed in a straight forward manner if bi = 0 f o r i > 0. The remaining terms follow from the linearity of the ODE and the Laplacian transform (compare e.g. ). Once a state space model has been constructed in this way, we can validate its quality by comparing the measured fre- quency response with the frequency response of the model. The frequency response of the model is given in (20). Integrating equation (25) in times allows to determine its response in the time domain. 4.01.03. State-space representation of acoustic network models Determining a state space model for an acoustic BC by ﬁtting its frequency response to a given reﬂection coeﬃcient, is a method which is of particular importance for complex conﬁgurations, where the reﬂection coeﬃcient is known only from experiment. The drawback of this approach is that changes in the experimental setup can be considered only by new experiments. Acoustic network models overcome this drawback with a divide and conquer approach. At ﬁrst a given complex conﬁguration is divided into subsystems. For each of these subsystems a model is determined. Finally, all theses models are interconnected in order to obtain a single model describing the whole conﬁguration. The state space representation of acoustic network models is discussed in detail by Schuermans et al and Bothien et al. Again the ducted exhaust section as already discussed in section 4.01.01 is a good example where network models can be very useful. A network model of this conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 7. The network model consists of two elements. The ﬁrst element models a duct section. For this part an analytical model can be derived analogously to the model shown in section 4.01.01. The second element is an open end. Here, analytical models are available. However, the reﬂection at an open end depends on the geometry behind the open end, which is diﬃcult to model in a general way. Therefore, it is beneﬁcial to describe this part with a ﬁtted model. This network model clearly combines the advantages of analytical and ﬁtted models. A change of the length of the duct section can be considered easily as this is a parameter of the analytical duct model and still an accurate model of the open end can be used. 4.02. The advantage of using continuous time state space models Discretizing the continuous-time state-space model (13) in time with a constant time step /Delta 1 t yields a discrete time state-space model x ((k+ 1)/Delta 1 t) = ˜Ax(k/Delta 1 t) + ˜Bu(k/Delta 1 t) (26 a) y(k/Delta 1 t) = ˜Cx(k/Delta 1 t) + ˜Du(k/Delta 1 t) (26 b) with t = k/Delta 1 t. The discrete state-space matrices are market with (˜ ·). Schuermans et al proposed to utilize this form of a state-space model. The drawback of this formulation is that it requires an interpolation to account for non-constant CFD time steps. Furthermore, transforming a continuous-time state-space model into discrete-time, explicitly, may (depending on the scheme used) yield dense matrices and thus be extremely ineﬃcient. In order to overcome this drawback we propose to use a continuous time state-space model, directly, and to integrated it with an ODE solver. This has the advantage that the behavior of an ODE solver is much better understood, which simpliﬁes a general and eﬃcient implementation. A discrete-time state-space model can be transformed into an IIR model y(k/Delta 1 t) = na∑ i=1 ˜ai y((k− i)/Delta 1 t) + nb∑ i=0 ˜biu((k− i)/Delta 1 t) (27) A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W. Polifke, Journal of Computational Physics, vol. 314, pp. 145–159, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.jcp.2016.003.0010. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier. 154 S. Jaensch et al / Journal of Computational Physics 314 145–159 with na coeﬃcients ˜ai and nb coeﬃcients ˜bi. This form is utilized in many TDIBC formulations [1–3,5–7]. There exists a transformation from the IIR model (27) to a time-discrete state-space model, similar to the transformation discussed in section 4.01.02. Therefore, IIR models can also be imposed if a implementation of TDIBC is based on the state-space represen- tation. As IIR models utilizes a ﬁxed time step, an interpolation scheme is necessary in order to account for non-constant time steps. However, the main problem when using the convolution formulation is that the coeﬃcients ˜ai and ˜bi are on the one hand hardly ever known, directly, and on the other hand that the response of the model can be extremely sensitive to a small change of the coeﬃcients. This diﬃculties arise because the transformation from a state-space model, which can be interpreted as a one-to-one representation of an acoustic solver, to an IIR model is poorly conditioned. Paige demonstrated that this transformation can become problematic for a system of order 10 and should not be used. Therefore, the only general way to determine the coeﬃcients of an IIR model is to ﬁt them to a given frequency response. As discussed in 4.01.02, this is also possible for state space models. Therefore, there exits no situation where IIR models are superior to state-space models. Hence, a general implementation of TDIBC should be based on continuous time state-space models, as proposed in the present work. In summary continuous state-space model have the following advantages: They can be understood as one-to-one corre- spondence to an acoustic solver In section 4.01.01 we have demonstrated this with a simplistic example, but more sophisticated discretization schemes or 3 D formulations are also possible. State-space models allow to account for non-constant CFD time steps in a robust and general way. When only the frequency response of the reﬂection coeﬃcient is known, a state-space model can be determined using a ﬁtting algorithm, which induces the same numerical error as when an IIR model is uti- lized (see section 4.01.02). As discussed in section 4.01.03, it is also possible to obtain a state-space model by interconnecting several state-space models. This is useful in many situations of practical interest. 4.03. Implementation of CBSBC A schematic implementation of CBSBC as outﬂow BC is given in Listing 1. In a pre-processing step the matrices A, B, C and D of the state space model are loaded from data ﬁle. Additionally, an external excitation ex,d (t) is read as a time series from a data ﬁle. The variables x(n−1), e(n−1) x,d and f(n−1) d are necessary in order to perform a clean restart. Here, the exponent (n − 1) denotes values at the last ﬁnal sub-time step. In contrast, the exponent (n) in Listing 1 corresponds to values at the current time or sub-time step. In the processing step at ﬁrst the values of the input signals e(n) x,d and f(n) d of the state space model are calculated. The current value of the external excitation e(n) x,d is determined by interpolating the corresponding time series. The wave leaving the CFD-domain f(n) d is determined by characteristic based ﬁltering according to equation (4 a). This is represented by calling the function cbf(). The second step is to calculate the amplitude g(n) d of the wave imposed to the CFD domain according to the output equation (13 b) of the state space model (13). In order to determine L 1 according to (10) the time derivative of the wave amplitude entering the domain has to be calculated. Therefore, at ﬁrst the derivative in time of the output equation (13 b) is taken ˙gd = C˙x + D˙u. (28) The derivative of the state vector ˙x is determined according to the state equation (13 a). The derivative of the input ˙u is calculated by a ﬁnite difference approximation, which yields the expression in line 7 in Listing 1. The next step is to calculate L 1 according to (10). Finally, at the ﬁnal sub-time step of the current CFD time step, the state space model is integrated in time for the time instance /Delta 1 t. This is indicated by calling the function integrate ODE(). The implementation used in the present study utilizes a forward Euler scheme for this integration. Additionally, the values at time (n − 1) are updated. As LES/ DNS time steps are typically much smaller then the time step required to integrate the acoustic model, the error created by the forward Euler scheme is small. Nevertheless, higher order time integration schemes for the state space models can be applied, if necessary. For an inﬂow BC one has to exchange the following variables in Listing 1 (compare Fig. 3) ex,d → ex,u, fd → gu, gd → fu. (29) Furthermore, at the inﬂow the wave L 5 has to be calculated according to (12). In comparison to the original NSCBC, CBSBC is changing only the way in which incoming waves are calculated. Hence, they can be implemented in a straight forward way on any solver, which already includes NSCBC. 4.04. Properties of the boundary condition The most important property of CBSBC is that the reﬂection coeﬃcient imposed is captured accurately, provided that all assumptions made for PWM hold. That is the acoustic waves impinging on the BC have to be plane and one is able to distinguish between acoustic and turbulent ﬂuctuations with a negligible error. Following we can prove this property A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W.

Hence, in this case the relaxation term vanishes and the CFD simulation will exhibit the reﬂection behavior imposed. In it was proposed to impose an impedance, directly. The velocity is calculated from the internal ﬁeld and the pressure BC is given as p = p∞ + Zd ∗ ⟨u − ¯u⟩. (31) Here, ∗ denotes a convolution. For the further analysis of the BC please recall the transformation from impedance to reﬂec- tion coeﬃcient and vice versa R(s) = Z(s) − ¯ρ¯c Z(s) + ¯ρ¯c ⇐⇒ Z(s) = ¯ρ¯c 1+ R(s) 1− R(s) (32) Applying the Laplace transform to (31) yields the reﬂection coeﬃcient Rd(s) = ˆgd(s) ˆfd(s) = ⟨(ˆp(s) − p∞ ) − ¯ρ¯c (ˆu(s) − ¯u )⟩ ⟨(ˆp(s) − p∞ ) + ¯ρ¯c (ˆu(s) − ¯u )⟩= Zd(s) − ¯ρ¯c Zd(s) + ¯ρ¯c = Rd(s), (33) which seems to be exactly the behavior desired. However, comparing (33) with (30) it becomes evident that imposing an impedance directly implies a relaxation coeﬃcient equal to zero. Hence, the BC given in (31) can be imposed only to linearized Navier–Stokes equations, as they will cause a drift of the mean quantities otherwise. In it was proposed to apply a high pass ﬁlter in order to avoid drift p = ¯p + FHP ∗ Zd ∗ ⟨u − ¯u⟩. (34) Here, FHP denotes the high pass ﬁlter. Its properties are FHP (ω = 0) = 0 and FHP (ω →∞ ) = 1. The resulting reﬂection coeﬃcient is Rd(s) = ˆgd(s) ˆfd(s) = FHP(s)Zd(s) − ¯ρ¯c FHP(s)Zd(s) + ¯ρ¯c ̸=Rd(s). (35) A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W.

Right: With a reﬂective inﬂow BC. As FHP (ω = 0) = 0 t h e reﬂection coeﬃcient for this formulation is equal to unity for low frequencies. This avoids drift, however, the CFD will not exhibit the reﬂection behavior desired for low frequencies. For high frequencies FHP (ω →∞ ) = 1 holds and thus, in this limit the formulation is equivalent to the formulation proposed in the present study. Please note, it is possible to impose a impedance using CBSBC. Therefore, we assume a model of the impedance in state space form is available ˙x = AZx + BZu′ A, (36 a) p′ A ¯ρ¯c = CZx + DZu′ A. (36 b) It has to be transformed into a state space model of the reﬂection coeﬃcient. This is done by inserting (2) into (36).

(37 b) We neglected the source term without essential loss of generality, it can be included in a straight forward manner. DZ =− 1 implies an inﬁnite reﬂection coeﬃcient and thus is unphysical. Please, note the transformation modiﬁes the A matrix of the state space model. Therefore, it may change the stability of the model from stable to unstable or vice versa. Fortunately, as will be demonstrated in the subsequent example, CBSBC works well with both stable and unstable state-space models. The example case is a 3 D CFD model of a 70 mm long cylindrical pipe, with slip walls and a mean ﬂow of 5 m /s. At the outlet we impose CBSBC with the reﬂection coeﬃcient Rd = K (s− p 1)(s− p 2), (38) where K = 2.05 · 107 and p 1,2 = 50 ± 5000 i. As the real part of the poles are larger than zero, the model is unstable. Using this setup, we performed two simulations: (1) a non-reﬂective inﬂow according to PWM was applied and (2) the inﬂow boundary condition was changed to a constant reﬂection coeﬃcient of Ru = 0.05. This value was determined by a stability analysis. A network model of the whole setup i.e. the CFD model with both boundary conditions as depicted in Fig. 3 was conﬁgured. This model predicts that the CFD setup should be unstable for Ru = 0 and stable for Ru = 0.05. The results of both simulations are shown in Fig. 8. The amplitudes in the ﬁrst case grow rapidly, as there is no stabiliza- tion mechanism. Please note, this simulation shows the robustness of our formulation as the simulation did not diverge up to reverse ﬂow with a Mach number larger than 0.07 a t the outﬂow BC. In the second case the reﬂective inﬂow BC stabilizes the simulation and the initial oscillation decays. As mentioned above, the transformation of the state space model for the impedance (36) to a state space model for the reﬂection coeﬃcient (37) can change the stability of the model. However, considering that the state-space representation is inherently causal, it is interesting to notice that both the impedance and the reﬂection coeﬃcient can be represented in the state-space representation. From this we can deduce that if the reﬂection coeﬃcient is causal the impedance is causal, too, and vice versa. A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W.

Numerical examples As discussed above, CBSBC is based on the same assumptions as PWM i.e. all waves impinging on the boundary are plane and one can determine their amplitude accurately. PWM itself was used for LES of highly turbulent and reactive ﬂows (see e.g. ). It is expected that also CBSBC yields accurate results in these situations. In the scope of the present work we implemented CBSBC in the solver AVBP and LESLIE. The results presented in the present paper were obtained with AVBP. Please note, the example shown could not have been achieved by any of the other TDIBC formulation mentioned in this paper. The formulations discussed in yield a reﬂection coeﬃcient equal to 1 f o r ﬂow frequencies. The method proposed in is valid only for linearized solver. The formulation discussed is based on IIR model, which has several drawbacks as discussed in section 4.02. An implementation of this approach accounting for non-constant time steps and higher order time integration would be very complicated. Therefore, a constant time-step and a one-step time integration scheme has been used in. 5.01. Laminar test case The domain of the laminar test case is cylindrical duct of 70 mm length with an diameter of 30 mm. The mesh is three dimensional and consists of 40320 hexahedral cells. At the wall we impose isothermal slip boundary conditions. The mean ﬂow velocity is 5 m /s. The CFL-number was set to 0.07. Four planes at the inlet and the outlet, respectively, were utilized for the CBF. At the inlet as well as at the outlet, we use CBSBC. The state space matrices imposed at the inlet are A = 0, B = [ ], C = 0, D = [ ]. (39) As the ﬁrst element of B and D, which correspond to the wave leaving the CFD domain (compare Eq. (13)), are equal to zero, this choice yields a non-reﬂective BC. The value 1 i n the D vector corresponds to the external source term and allows to impose an external acoustic excitation. We use this functionality to analyze the reﬂection coeﬃcient at the outlet BC by harmonic forcing. The time series required for the post processing are sampled by a probe located at the center line of the cylinder at the outlet. The use of probes ensures that the sampling is independent of any modiﬁcations made in the source code of AVBP in order to implement the boundary conditions. At the outﬂow BC we impose a state-space model which describes the upstream reﬂection coeﬃcient of the oriﬁce in- vestigated in. The reﬂection coeﬃcient itself was determined using the LES/SI approach, see and transformed into state-space form. We performed the simulation using a forward Euler scheme and the Taylor–Galerkin scheme TTGC. The results are shown in Fig. 9. The imposed and measured reﬂection coeﬃcients are in very good agreement. 5.02. Turbulent test case The turbulent test case is a three dimensional cylindrical duct with an diameter of 30 mm and a length of 150 mm. It was discretized with 518400 hexahedral cells. The mean ﬂow velocity is 9 m /sa n d the CFL-number was set to 0.07. At the A.2 P APER -CBSBC S. Jaensch, C. Sovardi, and W.

In order to impose turbulence CBSBC was combined with a turbulent inﬂow BC, which created a homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) with a RMS value of 1 m /s. Therefore, the turbulent ﬂuctuation was added to L 5. A WALE model was used for the LES. Again, we impose the TDIBC at the inlet and the outlet. The boundary at the outlet is non-reﬂective and the matrices are given in (39). At the inﬂow we impose the downstream reﬂection coeﬃcient of the oriﬁce investigated in. Again, a state-space model for this reﬂection coeﬃcient was determined with the LES/SI approach. In order to evaluate the actual reﬂection coeﬃcient at the inﬂow we imposed a broadband forcing signal at the out- ﬂow BC. Again, the data was collected with a probe located at the inﬂow boundary and hence, independently from our modiﬁcations of the source code. For the post processing we applied system identiﬁcation. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The imposed and measured reﬂection coeﬃcients are in excellent agreement. Please note, for these results we imposed CBSBC and a turbulence generator, simultaneously, at the inﬂow BC. 6. Conclusion CBSBC may be considered as a combination of the TDIBC formulations of Kaess et al and Schuermans et al. The coupling of the acoustic model and the ﬂow simulation is done by plane wave masking (PWM). We proved analytically that with this coupling the CFD exhibits the reﬂection behavior imposed, accurately, provided all acoustic waves impinging on the boundary are plane. Our analysis made evident that the coupling proposed in and yields ill posed problems if applied to LES/ DNS or incorrect result for low frequencies, respectively. Following Schuermans et al, we utilize a continuous-time state-space model to describe the frequency dependent reﬂection of acoustic waves. It was discussed that it allows a general and robust implementation. A comprehensive overview on the modeling of acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcients in state-space form was provided. We identiﬁed and discussed by way of examples three ways to determine a state-space model used for CBSBC: (1) A set of linear partial differential equations (PDE) is known to model the acoustic reﬂections. (2) Complex values of the reﬂection coeﬃcient at several distinct frequencies are available. (3) Different modeling approaches are combined using an acoustic network model. The state-space formulation also allows to add an external excitation. E.g. it allows to consider a loud speaker or a turbulent sound source within the impedance domain. The formulation proposed allows a simple yet general implementation. A pseudo-code example of an implementation which accounts for non-constant CFD time steps and which is independent from the time integration schemes of the ﬂow simulation was provided. Finally, we demonstrated numerically that our formulation handles complex and possibly unstable reﬂection coeﬃcients and that it works well with laminar as well as turbulent ﬂows.

Both models are hybrid formulations, where the flame and its immediate vicinity are resolved with a reactive flow simulation, while the acoustic field is modeled with a low-order model that is coupled to the reactive flow simulation. Firstly, a flame model based on the fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations is investigated. In this case, the flame simulation is coupled to the low-order model via the characteristic wave amplitudes at the inlet boundary. Secondly, the flame is resolved with a low Mach number reactive flow simulation. In order to include two-way thermoacoustic feedback, this flame model is coupled with an acoustic network model via the global heat release rate and the fluctuation of the axial veloc- ity at a reference position upstream of the flame. A bifurcation analysis using the plenum length as bifurcation parameter is conducted. Both models exhibit complex nonlinear oscillations and are in good agreement with each other. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling of a linear acoustic model and a nonlinear flame model via reference velocity and global heat release rate is sufficient to accurately capture thermoacoustic oscilla- tions of the configuration investigated. This implies that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects and flame kinematics. Furthermore, the study corroborates that premixed flames respond predominantly to fluctuations of the upstream flow velocity. © 2016 by The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Jaensch et al / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 36 3827–3834 results in very large oscillations of pressure, heat re- lease and velocity. These oscillations can reach am- plitude levels at which gas turbines have to be shut down, or rockets are destroyed. To decide whether a thermoacoustic instability reaches such amplitude levels, nonlinear models are required. This modeling is a challenging task, as complex nonlinear phenomena are involved. Durox et al studied the response of various laminar flame configurations to fluctuations of the inflow velocity. It was observed that the fluctuations of the global heat release rate saturate for high forcing ampli- tudes. Correspondingly, Kabiraj et al studied self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations of a lam- inar flame and observed periodic, aperiodic, or chaotic oscillations as well as hysteresis. In order to obtain qualitative and quantitative agreement with these experimental results, a model of thermoa- coustic instabilities has to account for all effects observed. Dowling proposed to model the non- linear flame dynamics with a flame describing func- tion (FDF). Noiray et al showed that the FDF combined with an acoustic network model pro- vides a useful estimate of limit cycle amplitudes in many cases. However, it is a frequency domain ap- proach and considers only a single unstable acous- tic mode. Therefore, it can only predict harmonic oscillations. The advantage of time-domain models is that they can account for multi-modal coupling, which is necessary to describe complex types of os- cillations. A time-domain model that has enjoyed recent interest uses a G -equation based flame model coupled with a low-order acoustic model [3,5–7]. This model shows complex nonlinear oscillations. However, the results depend strongly on the ve- locity model used. Indeed, the G -equation models found in the literature do not account for vortex shedding or vortex-flame interaction. Ad- ditionally, gas expansion and shear layer effects were reported to have a significant influence on the flame response. These effect are also not con- sidered by state-of-the-art G -equation implemen- tations. Therefore, quantitative agreement with ex- periment is not obtained and more sophisticated models are needed. A suitable low-order model has to account for the complex interactions between flame, flow and acoustics. The present study compares two mod- els which account for these effects: Firstly, a model which resolves the flame and its vicinity with a fully compressible, reactive flow simulation. As shown in Fig. 1, the simulation is coupled to the acoustic low order model via the characteristic wave ampli- tudes in order to model the full acoustic field of the plenum. In the following we denote this simulation “C-fg”. Secondly, a model as proposed by Moeck et al that utilizes a low Mach number, reactive flow simulation. Here, the density depends only on the temperature, but not on pressure. As shown in Fig. 2, this model is coupled to a low-order network model via a reference velocity and the global heat Fig. 1. Coupling of the fully compressible simulation and the corresponding acoustic model (Model: C-fg). Fig. 2. Coupling of the low Mach number simulation and the corresponding acoustic model. The reference velocity is measured at two different locations (compare Table 1 ) (Model: LM-uq). release rate. Consequently, we denote this model “LM-uq”. Please note that in the literature [12–14] other hybrid models for thermoacoustic oscillations have been proposed. However, the coupling used by these hybrid models has not been cross-validated in a systematic manner against a fully compressible simulation. This cross-validation allows to directly verify the coupling between flame, hydrodynamics and acoustics. In the following section, the two formulations are explained in detail. Thereafter, in Section 3 the results of the two models are compared via a bifur- cation analysis. Although, complex thermoacous- tic oscillations are observed, the two models are in good agreement with each other. Thus we conclude that the coupling of a nonlinear flame model and a linear acoustic model is sufficient to describe the thermoacoustic oscillation of the configuration in- vestigated. 2. Numerical setup The laminar slit burner considered in the present study is shown in Fig. 3. Kornilov et al and Duchaine et al investigated the linear dynam- ics of this configuration by experiment and simula- tion, respectively. Good agreement between experi- mental and numerical results was found. The CFD setup used in the present work corresponds to that A.3 P APER -HYBRID S. Jaensch, M. Merk, E. A. Gopalakrishnan, S.

As sketched in Fig. 3, sym- metry boundary conditions are imposed, such that only one half of one flame is resolved within the two dimensional CFD domain. A structured grid with 122,300 cells was used. In the region of the steady-state position of the flame and of the area contractions, the grid is uniform with a cell size of 0.0025 mm. This corresponds to about 18 grid points in the reactive zone. Outside this region the cells were stretched in the axial direction. At the inflow, we impose a mean velocity of 0.04 m/s and a temper- ature of 293 K. The plate on which the flame is sta- bilized is modeled as a no-slip wall with a fixed tem- perature of 373 K, as measured in experiment. The fuel is methane with an equivalence ratio of 0.08. For a detailed description of the two-step reac- tion mechanism we refer to. Fully non-reflective outlet acoustic boundary conditions are imposed, as indicated in Figs. 1 and 2. This simplistic treatment does not represent faithfully the acoustic radiation by a collection of unconfined flames, but is completely adequate for the purpose of cross-comparison of the two hy- brid approaches. Note that a more realistic radi- ation boundary condition such as the one pro- posed by Noiray et al could be implemented without essential difficulty in the low-order model as well as the fully compressible flow simulation. For the latter, one would employ the CBSBC formulation of time-domain impedance boundary conditions, see below. The transmission and reflection of acoustic waves at the burner plate is modeled explicitly in the compressible simulation by including the plate within the CFD domain. On the other hand, in the low Mach number simulation the plate is an element of the low-order acoustic model. The treatment of the inlet acoustic bound- ary conditions in models C-fg and LM-uq is ex- plained in the following subsections. 2.01. Compressible simulation –plenum modeled via acoustic boundary conditions By its nature, the compressible simulation used by the model C-fg captures the coupling between combustion, hydrodynamics and acoustics. How- ever, the plenum length L determines the acous- tic impedance at the burner plate and thus, is crucial for the thermoacoustic stability of the con- figuration. In order to capture thermoacoustic in- stabilities, the full plenum length has to be mod- eled. The most straight-forward way to model the plenum is to resolve it within the CFD do- main. However, this approach has two important drawbacks: (1) with standard boundary conditions, the acoustic impedance at the inlet of the ex- tended CFD domain can be imposed only with limited flexibility. (2) Changing the length of the plenum requires to create a new mesh. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in the present study Characteristics-Based State-Space Boundary Con- ditions (CBSBC), as proposed in Jaensch et al, are utilized to effectively extend the plenum to the full plenum length (compare Fig. 1 ). CBSBC provide a robust and consistent imple- mentation of time-domain impedance boundary conditions. This formulation allows to impose a frequency-dependent impedance and ensures that the CFD simulation exhibits with good accuracy the desired impedance values. CBSBC are based on a model of the reflection coefficient, which can be considered as equivalent to the acoustic impedance. The reflection coefficient has to be provided in state-space representation. We will first explain how the state-space model for the present study is deter- mined. Afterward, we show how the model is cou- pled with the compressible CFD simulation. Plane acoustic waves can be described by means of the characteristic wave amplitudes f = ( p ′ / ¯ρ ¯c + u ′ ), g = ( p ′ / ¯ρ ¯c − u ′ ), (1) with density ¯ρ, speed of sound ¯c. p ′ and u ′ are the acoustic pressure and velocity fluctuations, respec- tively. f corresponds to the wave traveling in the downstream direction and g to the wave traveling in the upstream direction. The one-dimensional, lin- earized Euler equations ∂ f ∂t + ( ¯u + ¯c ) ∂ f ∂x = 0 and ∂g ∂t + ( ¯u − ¯c ) ∂g ∂x = 0, (2) describe the propagation of the acoustic wave am- plitudes. At the inlet of the acoustic model the boundary condition u ′ (x = 0) = 0 ⇔ f (x = 0) = g(x = 0), (3) A.3 P APER -HYBRID S. Jaensch, M. Merk, E. A. Gopalakrishnan, S. Bomberg, T. Emmert, R. I.

Jaensch et al / Proceedings of the Combustion Institute 36 3827–3834 represents a rigid wall. At the outlet of the acoustic model the boundary condition g ( t, x = L A ) = g u ( t ), (4) allows to impose an arbitrary incoming wave g u ( t ). The discretization of Eq. (2) with a third-order up- wind scheme in space under consideration of the boundary conditions (3) and (4) can be written in state-space form ˙ x C-fg = A C-fg x C-fg + B C-fg g u (5 a) f u = C C-fg x C-fg, (5 b) with the state-space matrices A C-fg, B C-fg and C C-fg and the state-vector x C-fg. The index “C-fg” em- phasizes that the state-space model belongs to the model C-fg. For a tutorial explanation of how these matrices can be determined we refer to. The second step is to couple the model (5) with the CFD simulation. CBSBC extends the well-known Navier–Stokes characteristic bound- ary conditions (NSCBC). As in the NSCBC framework, CBSBC define the derivative of pres- sure p and velocity u according to ∂p ∂t + ( L 5 + L 1 ) = 0, ∂u ∂t + ( L 5 − L 1 ) = 0. (6) Here, L 5 and L 1 are the temporal derivatives of the characteristic wave amplitudes f and g, respectively. With a setup as shown in Fig. 1, L 1 corresponds to the wave leaving the CFD domain and is given as L 1 = ( u − c ) ( ∂p ∂x − ρc ∂u ∂x ). (7) L 5 corresponds to the f-wave entering the domain and has to be imposed L 5 = σ( u − ( f u − g d ) − u T ) + 2 ∂ f u ∂t, (8) The term ( f u − g d ) is equal to the acoustic veloc- ity fluctuation. Including this term in the relaxation term avoids artificial reflections at the boundaries of the CFD domain, as it compensates the effect of the acoustic fluctuation on the relaxation term. The term ∂ f u / ∂ t allows to impose an ingoing wave. Please note that Eq. (8) is equal to the formulation given in Polifke et al. Solving Eqs. (5) –(8) at every time step allows to extend the acoustic domain to the full plenum length. By changing the length L A we can change the plenum length without the requirement of a new mesh. At the outlet of the compressible simula- tion we impose non-reflective boundary conditions as proposed by Polifke et al. The fully com- pressible simulations were conducted using AVBP 1 1 http://cerfacs.fr/en/computational- fluid- dynamics- softwares/ (Cerfacs and IFP). The Lax–Wendroff scheme was used for the discretization. This scheme is second- order accurate in both time and space. The time step was set to ensure an acoustic CFL number less than 0.07. 2.02. Low Mach number simulation –coupled to acoustics via Rankine–Hugoniot The model LM-uq is based on a low Mach num- ber simulation. With such a formulation, which is also called weakly compressible, the density de- pends only on the temperature, but not on pressure. In this way acoustic waves and hence, thermoacous- tic feedback inside the CFD domain is suppressed. In order to account for the thermoacoustic feed- back, the low Mach number simulation is coupled with an acoustic network model via the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot equations for a compact heat source. As shown in Fig. 2, the network model and the low Mach number simulation are coupled via the global heat release rate ˙ q ′ and a reference velocity u ref. It can be shown that the coupling is equivalent to the one proposed by Moeck et al. As the acoustic model is linear it can be written in state-space form ˙ x LM−uq = A LM-uq x LM-uq + B LM-uq ˙ q ′ (9 a) u ref = C LM-uq x LM-uq + D LM −uq ˙ q ′, (9 b) with the state-space matrices A LM-uq, B LM-uq and, C LM-uq and the state-vector x LM-uq. Here, the index “LM-uq” emphasizes that the state-space model belongs to the low Mach number simulation. A detailed description of how these matrices may be formulated can be found in Emmert et al [21– 23]. The elements of the network model are shown in Fig. 2. As for the C-fg case the duct sections are modeled using the linearized Euler equations. The model for the area jump is based on the continuity equation and does not include acoustic losses. The inlet BC of the acoustic network model is a reflec- tion coefficient of 1, which corresponds to a rigid wall. The outlet BC is a non-reflective boundary condition. The temperature ratio across the flame is 6.01. Overall, both the models LM-uq and C-fg describe the configuration shown in Fig. 3. The Rankine–Hugoniot equations assumes that the flame is compact with respect to the acoustic wavelength. Considering the height of the flame of about 5 mm and the length of the plenum which is the characteristic dimension of the acoustics for longitudinal modes, varying between 200 and 1000 mm, this assumption is fulfilled with good ac- curacy. The flame acts as an acoustic point source while the real flame has some spacial extent. The ex- act position of this source is a model parameter. In the present study this position was chosen 2.06 mm after the burner plate. Additionally, it is assumed that the flame responds only to fluctuations of the reference velocity.

As indicated in Fig. 2, two different positions were in- vestigated: (1) 15 mm upstream of the burner plate. This position coincides with the inlet boundary of the low Mach number simulation and is denoted as reference 0 (compare Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). (2) The reference velocity was chosen at the upstream side of the burner plate. In Fig. 2 and Table 1 this posi- tion is denoted as reference 1. The open-source finite volume code Open- FOAM 2 was used as low Mach number CFD solver. For the temporal integration the implicit Euler scheme with a (hydrodynamic) CFL number of 0.03 was employed. Gaussian integration is ap- plied. The gradient operator is discretized with the linear scheme and the divergence operator with lim- ited linear differencing scheme. A transient SIM- PLEC algorithm was used, which stopped iter- ating once the residuals were lower than 10 −6. 3. Numerical results The model settings for which self-excited ther- moacoustic instabilities were observed are listed in Table 1. Simulations with two different initial con- ditions were conducted. (1) The simulations de- noted with “low” were started from a converged mean field. Here, only a small initial acoustic exci- tation was applied. This speeds up the development of a thermoacoustic oscillation and allows to re- duce the computational costs significantly. (2) The simulations denoted with “high”were started from a initial condition taken from a snapshot with de- veloped thermoacoustic oscillation. For all values of the plenum length L the same snapshot is used. The two different reference positions for the model LM-uq were explained in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 2. Depending on the complexity of the oscillations observed for each case, time se- ries between 100 and 500 ms were generated. The first part of the time series at which the thermoa- coustic oscillations are not yet fully developed were not included in the post-processing. The two mod- els were compared w.r.t. the normalized fluctuation 2 http://www.openfoam.org/ Fig. 4.

In the remainder of this section the two models are first compared via a bifurcation analysis. Thereafter, the cases with a plenum length of L = 200 mm and L = 700 mm are investigated in detail. 3.01. Bifurcation analysis In Figs. 4 (top) and 5 the variation of the root mean square (RMS) value with plenum length and the bifurcation diagram are shown, respectively. The amplitudes predicted by the two models are in good agreement with each other. This holds in par- ticular for short plenum lengths L. For long plenum lengths the amplitudes predicted by the model LM- uq are slightly lower than the amplitudes predicted by the model C-fg. The corresponding velocities correspond to Reynolds numbers of about 1000. Thus, the flow is in the transition to turbulence. At the onset of the thermoacoustic oscillations, we observe what appears to be a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Note that this assessment is based on a A.3 P APER -HYBRID S. Jaensch, M. Merk, E. A.

A smaller step size /Delta 1 L may reveal a weakly pronounced subcriti- cal Hopf bifurcation. The models C-fg and the LM-uq with refer- ence position 1 (compare Fig. 2 ) become unsta- ble at a plenum length of L = 160 mm. The model LM-uq with reference position 0, however, exhibits a thermoacoustic instability starting at a plenum length of 170 mm. Therefore, the less intuitive cou- pling using a reference position right before the burner plate is more accurate than the coupling us- ing a reference position that coincides with the in- let boundary of the low Mach number simulation. The reason is that due to the low Mach number formulation, a velocity fluctuation imposed at the inlet will act immediately on the whole CFD do- main. In the low-order acoustic model, on the other hand, the fluctuations propagate with the speed of sound. Therefore, the reference position at which the acoustic velocity is extracted from the low-order acoustic model should be chosen at the location where acoustic fluctuations create hydrodynamic fluctuations. In the present configuration, this po- sition is at the burner plate. In Fig. 5 bifurcation diagrams of the two mod- els are shown. In Fig. 4 (bottom) the dominant frequencies f u predicted with the different setups investigated are shown. The comparison shows that also the nature of the oscillations predicted by the two models is in good agreement with each other. A significant difference is observed at a plenum length of L = 500 mm.

Comparison of time series In Fig. 6 the time series (top plots) and the power spectrum (bottom plots) of the unsteady ve- locity for a plenum length of 200 mm and 700 mm are shown. Both plots show that the simulations are in good agreement with each other. Consistent with the bifurcation diagram, the amplitude at a plenum length of 700 mm is significantly larger than the amplitude at L = 200 mm. In the power spectrum for L = 700 mm a noise content is observed, which can be attributed to the onset of turbulence due to the high oscillation amplitudes. The corresponding maximum Reynolds number observed inside the slit of the burner plate is about 1000. The nonlinear dynamics of the thermoacous- tic instabilities observed can be better understood with the help of phase portraits. Phase portraits represent the asymptotic state of the system in the phase space. We reconstruct the phase space by ap- plying Takens’ embedding theorem. The delay τ is chosen to correspond to the first minima of the average mutual information and the minimum embedding dimension is found using the method of false nearest neighbors. A detailed description of the techniques involved in the phase space re- construction in the context of a thermoacoustic system can be found in Kabiraj and Sujith. As shown in Fig. 7, also the phase portraits are in good agreement with each other. From the phase por- trait we can also deduce the nature of the oscilla- tion observed: We are observing Period-2 oscilla- tions at L = 200 mm and limit cycle oscillations at L = 700 mm.

Summary and conclusion Two nonlinear, hybrid, time-domain models of self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities of a lami- nar premixed flame (see Fig. 3 ) were implemented and cross-validated. The model C-fg –s e e Fig. 1 – resolves the flame with a fully compressible and reactive simulation. A low-order model of the plenum of the burner is coupled to the simula- tion via the characteristic wave amplitudes. This al- lows to change the length of the plenum without modifying the computational grid. Alternatively, the model LM-uq –s e e Fig. 2 –u s e s a low Mach number formulation of the Navier–Stokes equa- tions to describe the flame dynamics. In order to ac- count for the thermoacoustic feedback this simula- tion is coupled to an acoustic network model. Here, the two-way coupling is based on the Rankine– Hugoniot equations and uses a reference velocity measured upstream of the flame and the global heat release rate. A bifurcation analysis with the plenum length as bifurcation parameter was conducted. The two models were in good agreement with each other. The compressible simulation on which the model C-fg is based on resolves the flame acoustic in- teraction, possible nonlinear scattering of acous- tic waves and hydrodynamic effects. On the other hand, the low Mach number simulation utilized by the model LM-uq, suppresses all acoustic effects inside the CFD domain. Thus, in this model the acoustic field is acting on the flame only via fluc- tuations of the reference velocity. The bifurcation analysis shows good agreement of the two models, thus we conclude that the flame investigated indeed responds predominantly to fluctuations of the ref- erence velocity. This holds even while the flame ex- hibits complex thermoacoustic oscillations. Conse- quently, the acoustic pressure p ′ and acoustic waves f, g act on the flame only indirectly, as they cause fluctuations of the reference velocity u ′. This se- quence of cause and effect has been questioned in the context of the recent discussion on the intrin- sic thermoacoustic feedback [27–32]. Furthermore, the comparison shows that the nonlinearities ob- served can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects or to the flame kinematics. The models investigated in the present study form a basis for further research. On the one hand the two models can be extended in a straightfor- ward manner to take into account effects such as conjugate heat transfer or three dimensional effects. This is expected to be necessary in order to ob- tain models which reproduce experimental results with quantitative accuracy. Here, the most critical limitations are that both models are restricted to the low-frequency regime and that the model LM- uq is valid only for velocity sensitive heat sources. On the other hand the models can serve as refer- ence for nonlinear reduced-order models for the dynamics of laminar flames. In Jaensch and Po- lifke results of the model LM-uq are compared against predictions made with artificial neural net- works. Furthermore, both coupling methods also work with LES and therefore, allow a detailed nu- merical study of thermoacoustic oscillations of tur- bulent flames. This is of significant applied interest and will be the subject of future investigations. Acknowledgment The financial support for S.

Original Research Article Uncertainty encountered when modelling self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations with artificial neural networks Stefan Jaensch and Wolfgang Polifke Abstract Artificial neural networks are a popular nonlinear model structure and are known to be able to describe complex nonlinear phenomena. This article investigates the capability of artificial neural networks to serve as a basis for deducing nonlinear low-order models of the dynamics of a laminar flame from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The methodology can be interpreted as an extension of the CFD/system identification approach: a CFD simulation of the flame is perturbed with a broadband, high-amplitude signal and the resulting fluctuations of the global heat release rate and of the reference velocity are recorded. Thereafter, an artificial neural network is identified based on the time series collected. Five data sets that differ in amplitude distribution and length were generated for the present study. Based on each of these data sets, a parameter study was conducted by varying the structure of the artificial neural network. A general fit-value criterion is applied and the 10 artificial neural networks with the highest fit values are selected. Comparing of these 10 artificial neural networks allows to obtain information on the uncertainty encountered. It is found that the methodology allows to capture the forced response of the flame reasonably well. The validation against the forced response, however, depends strongly on the forcing signal used. Therefore, an additional validation criterion is investigated. The artificial neural networks are coupled with a thermoacoustic network model. This allows to model self- excited thermoacoustic oscillations. If the training time series are sufficiently long, this coupled model allows to predict the trend of the root mean square values of fluctuations of the global heat release rate. However, the prediction of the maximal value of the fluctuation amplitude is poor. Another drawback found is that even if very long-time series are available, the behaviour of artificial neural networks cannot be guaranteed. It is concluded that more sophisticated nonlinear low-order models are necessary.

These oscillations are nonlinear. Hence, in order to decide whether or not a thermoacoustic oscillation reaches critical amplitude levels, nonlinear low-order models are necessary. Several models have been developed to predict these amplitude levels. The ﬂame describing function (FDF) combined with a one-dimensional model for the acous- tics has been proven to give useful estimates of the oscillation amplitudes in many cases.1–3 It is also pos- sible to deduce an FDF from a CFD simulation. 4–6 The FDF is limited to harmonic oscillations, where higher harmonics in the ﬂame response are unimportant. As shown by Moeck and Paschereit 7 and Orchini et al, 8 the FDF can be extended to the so-called ﬂame double input describing function (FDIDF). This increases the accuracy of the prediction signiﬁcantly. However, determining a FDIDF is T echnische Universita¨t M u¨nchen, Fakulta¨tf u¨r Maschinenwesen, Garching, Germany Corresponding author: Stefan Jaensch, T echnische Universita¨t M u¨nchen, Fakulta¨tf u¨r Maschinenwesen, D-85747 Garching, Germany.

Consequently, no quantitative agreement with experiment is obtained. A promising technique is hybrid CFD/low-order models. 12–16 These models have the advantage that they can account for the complex interaction between heat source, ﬂow and acoustics. Additionally, compared to a fully compress- ible simulation of the whole thermoacoustic conﬁgur- ation, the computational eﬀort can be signiﬁcantly reduced. However, the computational eﬀort is still high and more eﬃcient non-linear low-order models are needed. A general methodology for deriving low-order models from a CFD simulation is the CFD/system iden- tiﬁcation (SI) approach.17 The general idea of the CFD/ SI approach is to force a CFD simulation with broad- band excitation signal. If the ﬂame dynamics of a pre- mixed ﬂame is to be determined, the resulting ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity and of the global heat release rate is recorded. From these time series low-order models can be deduced by system identiﬁcation. 18,19 In the linear regime, the CFD/SI approach is known to yield accurate estimates of the ﬂame transfer function (FTF).17 The CFD/SI approach can be extended to the nonlinear regime.18,20 Selimefendigil et al 21–23 used the method to identify nonlinear low-order models for a cylinder in pulsating crossﬂow. Zhang et al24 used Hammerstein–Wiener models to deduce nonlinear low- order models from a G-equation solver. In the present study, the CFD/SI approach is used to obtain nonlinear low-order models of a laminar ﬂame. The capability of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) to serve as the nonlinear model structure is investigated. ANNs have become a very popular black-box model in the last decades. They have been used to predict stock prices to forecast the weather and to model air- crafts. The ANN framework provides a model structure, which can easily be extended in such a way that very complex nonlinearities can be described. Consequently, it is expected that there exists an ANN that describes the nonlinear ﬂame dynamic accurately. Indeed, Blonbou et al25,26 and Vaudrey and Saunders 27 showed that ANNs can be used to control combustion instabilities. However, the model structure of an ANN has a large number of parameters and consequently, ANNs are prone to over-ﬁtting. This phenomenon occurs in particular if only short time series are avail- able. In contrast to experimental test rigs, as investigated by Blonbou et al25,26 and Vaudrey and Saunders, 27 the time series used for the CFD/SI approach should be as short as possible. Otherwise, no advantage in computa- tional time can be achieved. Therefore, the key question addressed in the present study is whether or not an appropriate ANN can be determined based on the lim- ited information available, i.e. the broadband time series. An ANN is considered to be appropriate if on the one hand it can capture the forced response of the ﬂame. This criterion allows to validate the predicted ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate in both the time and the frequency domain in a straightforward manner. A drawback of this comparison is that it depends strongly on the forcing signal used. Therefore, on the other hand, an additional validation criterion is investigated. The ANNs identiﬁed are combined with a thermoacoustic network model in order to model self- excited thermoacoustic oscillations. The predicted oscil- lations are compared against the results obtained with the hybrid CFD/low-order models discussed in Jaensch et al 16 This validation analyses if small errors made by the ANN accumulate and is very close to the application considered. A diﬃculty of this validation is that thermo- acoustic oscillations can be very complex, which makes a direct comparison in the time or frequency domain diﬃcult. In the present study, we compare the oscilla- tions predicted in terms of root mean square (RMS)- values and the maximal ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. In the next section, the CFD setup is introduced, which forms the basis of the present study. Thereafter, we discuss how ANNs can be used for the CFD/SI approach. Then, the methodology is validated in terms of forced response and self-excited oscillations. 2 Numerical setup The CFD setup is shown in Figure 1 and corresponds to the multi-slit burner investigated by Kornilov et al28 Figure 1.

In contrast to Duchaine et al,29 al o w Mach formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations was solved. This implies that the density depends on the tem- perature only, but not on the pressure. Consequently, the acoustics inside the computational domain is suppressed. In particular, this modiﬁcation also suppresses the intrin- sic thermoacoustic feedback.30 It is expected that this simpliﬁes the identiﬁcation signiﬁcantly, it allows us to investigate an open-loop problem. Open FOAM (http:// www.openfoam.org/) was used as CFD solver. The CFD setup used in the present study is identical to the low- Mach simulation described in Jaensch et al 16 3 ANNs In the present section, ﬁrst the structure of ANNs is introduced. Afterward, it is discussed how ANNs can be used as a nonlinear model structure for the CFD/SI approach. 3.01 Structure of ANNs An ANN consists of interconnected neurons. A single neuron is a function y ¼ /C 27 u,ðÞ with input vector u and a scalar output y. is the parameter vector. The func- tion /C 27 (/C 1 ) is called the activation function. In principle, any function can be used. For practical applications, sigmoid functions and radial basis functions (RBF) have been proven to be useful choices. 20;18 Examples of both functions plotted in Figure 2. A sigmoid func- tion is given as /C 27 Sig u,ðÞ ¼ 2 1 þ exp /C 0 2?Tu /C 0/C 1 /C 0 1 ð1Þ Here, the parameter vector? weights the inputs. Consequently, the elements /C 2 k of? are called weights. A radial basis function is deﬁned as /C 27 RBF u,c, /C 6ðÞ ¼ exp /C 0 1 2 ku /C 0 ck 2 /C 6 /C 18/C 19 ð2Þ with the generalized norm ku /C 0 ck/C 6 ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ u /C 0 cðÞ T /C 6 u /C 0 cðÞ q ð3Þ Here, the parameter vector? is represented by the centre vector c and the norm matrix. These quantities correspond to the mean vector and the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution. In order to reduce the number of parameters,/C 6 is assumed to be a diagonal matrix. Several interconnected neurons build an ANN. As depicted in Figure 3, ANNs are structured in several layers. The inputs of the ANN are time-lagged velocity signals u 0 t /C 0 i/C 1 tðÞ. Here, i is the time increment and /C 1 t is the time step. The inputs of the ANN are also the inputs of the neurons positioned in the ﬁrst layer. The inputs of the neurons in the second layer are the out- puts of the neurons in the ﬁrst layer and so on. The last layer consists of a single neuron with a linear activation function. Note that all neurons positioned in the same layer have the same inputs. As only time-lagged input signals and no time-lagged output signals are the inputs of the ANN the impulse response of the ANNs con- sidered is ﬁnite and has the lengthn/C 1 t. An inﬁnite impulse response would require us to pass the output of the ANN as feedback to its inputs. This is analogue to a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) model used for lin- ear system identiﬁcation. The ﬁniteness of the impulse response reﬂects the convective nature of the ﬂame dynamics: an impulse velocity perturbation impinging on the ﬂame causes a perturbation of the ﬂame front and consequently a ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. Blumenthal et al31 showed for a G- equation ﬂame model that the perturbation of the ﬂame front is convected through the ﬂame and that the original ﬂame front is restored via a convective Figure 3. Generic example of a structure of an artificial neural network with four neurons in the first layer, two neurons in the second layer and a single neuron in the third layer. Figure 2.

Once the perturbation and the restoration are convected through the ﬂame, the ﬂuctu- ation of the global heat release vanishes instantan- eously. Thus the impulse response of the ﬂame is ﬁnite. Therefore, the FIR model should be considered as a grey-box model of the ﬂame.32 It is expected that these considerations hold for the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. In general, the ANN framework allows to additionally consider time-lagged values of the output signal, i.e. the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate, as inputs of to the neural network. However, this yields an oscillatory impulse response, which does not corre- spond to the convective nature of the ﬂame response. Silva et al33 show that these so-called auto-regressive models are useful for modeling the scattering matrix of a ﬂame, but not for the FTF. Typically, all activation functions of neurons pos- itioned in the same layer are identical. If RBFs are used, it is advantageous to normalize the output of thek-th neuron in a layer by the output of all neurons in the same layer /C 27 NRBF, k u,c, /C 6ðÞ ¼ /C 27 RBF u,c k, /C 6 kðÞPM i¼0 /C 27 RBF u,c i, /C 6 iðÞ ð4Þ with M being the number of neurons in the layer. The function NRBF;k(u, c, /C 6 ) is called normalized radial basis function (NRBF). 3.02 Identification of ANNs The identiﬁcation procedure used to determine the unknown parameter vector? of an ANN is similar to the procedure used for linear identiﬁcation 17,18: 1. First, a broad band time series is created. 2. The model structure has to be chosen. 3. The unknown parameters are determined by solving an optimization problem. 4. The model identiﬁed must be validated. In order to generate broad band time series, the CFD simulation introduced above was forced with diﬀerent broadband excitation signals. The signals were gener- ated with the method discussed in Fo¨ller and Polifke.34 As for the linear CFD/SI approach, the fre- quency content of the signal should be chosen such that all frequencies of interests are excited. For the nonlinear identiﬁcation, also the amplitude of the signal is import- ant. Therefore, signals with diﬀerent amplitudes are investigated in the present study. The particular signals used are discussed in detail in the next section. The second step of the identiﬁcation procedure is to ﬁx the structure of the ANN. This means choosing the activation function, the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer. Additionally, the max- imum delay n has to be ﬁxed. Unfortunately, there exist no general design rules for choosing the structure of an ANN. Typically, one identiﬁes several ANNs with diﬀerent structures and selects the ANN with the best performance. In the present study, this is done in terms of a large parameter study, which is discussed in the next section. The third step of the identiﬁcation procedure is to determine the vector of unknown parameters? of the neural networks. This is done by solving the optimiza- tion problem min? N XN/C 0 1 i¼0 q 0 ANN i/C 1 t,ðÞ /C 0 q 0 CFD i/C 1 tðÞ /C 0/C 1 2 ð5Þ This optimization problem is nonlinear and conse- quently, nonlinear optimization algorithms are neces- sary. These algorithms are based on error backpropagation, which allows to calculate the gradient of the cost function analytically. In comparison to the Wiener–Hopf inversion, the computational eﬀort required is signiﬁcantly larger. However, compared to the computational costs of the CFD simulation, the computational eﬀort is still negligible. A particularity of ANNs is that the optimization is non-deterministic. Recall from the discussion of the structure of ANNs that the inputs and outputs of all neurons pos- itioned in the same layer are equal (see also Figure 3). Hence, neurons positioned in the same layer diﬀer only with respect to their parameter vector. Consequently, if in order to solve the optimization problem all param- eters are initialized to zero, after the optimization the parameters of all neurons positioned in the same layer will be equal. The performance of such an ANN would be poor. In order to avoid this behaviour, the parameter vector is initialized to small, random values. Consequently, re-identifying an ANN with the same structure several times can yield ANNs, showing a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent performance. Note that only the optimization algorithm is non-deterministic. ANNs are a deterministic model once all parameters have been determined. The number of unknown parameters of an ANN grows rapidly with the number of neurons and layers. This enables ANNs to model complex nonlinearities, however, it creates the risk of over-ﬁtting. If the optimization problem (5) is solved untill convergence, the quality of the ANN obtained would be poor. In order to avoid over-ﬁtting, the data used to identify the parameters of the ANNs is divided into three diﬀerent data sets: training data, validation data and test data. The optimization algorithm calcu- lates the gradient of the cost function using only the training data set. The optimization stops when the 4 International Journal of Spray and Combustion Dynamics 0(0) A.4 P APER -ANN S. Jaensch, W.

In the pre- sent work, 70% of the data are used as training data, 15% as validation data and 15% as test data. The data were divided randomly using a ﬁxed seed. For the present study, the default implementation of ANNs in Matlab (www.mathworks.com, version: R 2015 b) is used. 4 Numerical results Unfortunately, there are no general design rules for the structure of neural networks. Indeed, as the training of neural networks is non-deterministic, two ANNs with the same structure can show totally diﬀerent behaviour. This holds even if the same data set was used to train both networks. In order to use ANNs to model self- excited thermoacoustic oscillations a criterion is neces- sary, which allows to decide whether or not an ANN identiﬁed is a good low-order model of the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. This criterion should be based on the broadband time series used to identify the network. Otherwise, the computational eﬀort required to ﬁnd a suitable ANN can make the methodology prohibitively expensive. The criterion investigated in the present work is the ﬁt value deﬁned as fit ¼ 100 1 /C 0 kq 0 CFD /C 0 q 0 ANNk kq 0 CFD /C 0 q 0 CFDk /C 18/C 19 ð6Þ with the temporal average q 0 CFD of the ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate measured in the CFD simula- tion. This criterion is also known as normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The criterion is evaluated using the full broadband time series including training data, validation data and test data. Recall that the weights of the ANN are determined via the optimization procedure discussed in the previous section using the validation and the training data. The test data are not used. Considering this data to select the optimal ANNs is an additional method to prevent over-ﬁtting. In order to increase the generalizability of the results of the present study, a large number of ANNs with diﬀerent structures were identiﬁed using the ﬁve data Figure 4. Five different data sets used to generate the ANNs.

The underlying parameter study is explained in detail in the next sub- section. Thereafter, the ANNs selected are validated against the forced response and against self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. 4.01 Setup of the parameter study As shown in Figure 4, ﬁve diﬀerent broadband time series are investigated. These data sets were generated by forcing the inﬂow velocityu 0 of the CFD simulation with three diﬀerent broadband excitation signals. The length of the time series obtained is 100/C 28. Here, /C 28 is the length of the impulse response of the ﬂame and is equal to 10 ms. All signals are statistically independent from each other and were generated with the non-Gaussian simulation method described in Fo ¨ller and Polifke. 34 A small part of the signal is shown in Figure 7. The signals were scaled such that the amplitudeu 0= /C 22 u of the ﬁrst signal is 50%, the one of the second signal is 100% and the one of the third signal is 150%. From the three time series obtained, ﬁve diﬀerent data sets were generated. These data sets are shown in Figure 4. The data sets 1, 2 and 3 are the time series directly generated by the CFD simulation. Data set 4 is concatenated and consists of the ﬁrst third of the data sets 1 to 3, respect- ively. Data set 5 is concatenated and consists of the full data sets 1 to 3. Data set 4 and 5 are investigated in to analyse whether signals containing several excitation amplitude levels can improve the results. In the linear regime, the length of the time series and its power spec- tral density are suﬃcient to characterize the excitation signal used for identiﬁcation. This is because linearity implies that the response is independent from the exci- tation amplitude. In the nonlinear regime, however, also the distribution of the amplitudes is important. In Figure 4, this is shown by the empirical probability density function. In addition to the time series, also the structure of the ANN is varied. The parameters changed are listed in Table 1.

On each of the ﬁve data sets shown in Figure 4, ANNs with the resulting structures were identiﬁed. In order to ﬁnd an optimal ANN for each of the structures, the non-deter- ministic optimization algorithm was 10 times repeat- edly applied. Thereafter, the ﬁt value achieved by each ANN was determined. The 10 ANNs with the highest ﬁt values on each data set were selected. The capability of these optimal ANNs to model the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics is investigated in the next subsections. 4.02 Validation of the forced response In Figure 5, the FDF deduced from the ANNs is com- pared against the results obtained from the CFD simu- lation. An FDF can be deduced from an ANN analogously to the way it is deduced from a CFD simu- lation or an experiment: at ﬁrst the ANN is forced with Figure 6.

The output of the ANN is its prediction of the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. The ratio of the Fourier transformed input and output signals at the forcing frequency is the value of the FDF. For frequencies up to 200 Hz, the phases predicted by the ANNS are in excellent agreement with the CFD refer- ence data. Also for higher frequencies, the phase is pre- dicted well. The variance of the results is large only for the highest forcing amplitude considered, i.e. 150% and for the ANNs identiﬁed on data set 4. Errors at these high frequencies are expected as the gain of the FDF is very small. The picture is less distinct for the predicted gain. Overall, the low-pass characteristic of the FDF is captured well by the ANNs. The variance of the pre- diction is quite small for an excitation amplitude of 50% and increases for the higher excitation amplitudes considered. At an excitation amplitude of 50%, a large variance is observed for the ANNs identiﬁed on data set 5. This is a problematic observation. It shows that even if very long-time series are available, it cannot be guaranteed that the ANNs identiﬁed predict the FDF Figure 7.

The results with the ANNs identi- ﬁed on data set 5 improve for higher excitation ampli- tudes. Here, the prediction is more accurate than the one made by the ANNs identiﬁed on the other data sets. Validating against the FDF allows to compare the results for several diﬀerent forcing amplitudes and fre- quencies. However, the analysis is limited to the forcing frequency. This ignores the capability of ANNs to pre- dict also a non-harmonic response of the ﬂame. Therefore, in Figure 6, the response of the optimal ANNs to a harmonic forcing signal is shown in the time domain. The predicted ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate is validated against the prediction made by the CFD. At an excitation amplitude of 50%, the results are in good agreement with each other and independent from the data set used to iden- tify the ANNs. The variance of the prediction made by the ANNs increases signiﬁcantly with the excitation amplitude. Up to an amplitude level of 100%, the shape of the response is captured quite well. At 150% amplitude, the peaks of the response are still captured, however, the variance becomes large. The results obtained with data set 4 and data set 5 are slightly more robust. This is expected as these data sets include all excitation amplitudes. In Figure 7, the ANNS are compared on the last 10 t=/C 28 of data set 5. The shape of the response is captured by all sets of ANNs. The ANNs identiﬁed on data sets 3 and 5 show the lowest variance. This is because the ﬁt criterion used to select these ANNs contains also the broadband signal shown in Figure 7. The variance of the other sets of optimal neurons is larger. Nevertheless, the main features of the time series are still captured. 4.03 Validation against self-excited oscillations From the analysis of the forced response, we can con- clude that over-ﬁtting was successfully avoided by the procedure applied to obtain the sets of optimal ANNs. However, the analysis depends strongly on the forcing signal used. Therefore, in the present section, the cap- ability of the ANNs identiﬁed to predict self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations is investigated. Both the weakly compressible CFD simulation and the ANNs are models for the ﬂame dynamics of the laminar ﬂame considered. In order to model self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations, they need to be coupled with a model for the acoustics. In Figures 8 and 9, the coupling of the CFD simulation and of an ANN with an acoustic network model is shown, respectively. In Jaensch et al,16 the coupling of the CFD and the network model is described in detail. The ANNs are coupled with the acoustic model using Matlab/ Simulink. In Figure 10, the self-excited thermoacoustic oscilla- tions are compared in terms of their RMS values and in terms of the maximal ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. The bifurcation parameter is the plenum length, as shown in Figures 1, 8 and 9. At each length investigated, a self-excited oscillation was calculated with all optimal ANNs for 50 /C 28. As discussed by Jaensch et al, 16 the thermoacoustic oscillations of the present conﬁgurations hardly depend on the initial con- dition used. In order to minimize the computational eﬀort of the CFD simulation the simulation, was started from a perturbed case. This situation cannot be reproduced with the ANNs. Therefore, we focus the discussion on comparing the fully developed ther- moacoustic oscillation. For the results shown in Figure 10, only the last 20 /C 28 of the 50 /C 28 time series are used. At several working points numerical instabilities were observed. One example of such a numerical instability is shown in Figure 11. The oscillation pre- dicted by the ANN develops signiﬁcantly more slowly than the oscillation predicted by the CFD simulation. This mismatch is due to the diﬀerent initial conditions used and thus, expected. After about 25 /C 28, the Figure 8. Coupling of the CFD simulation with an acoustic network model to model self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. Figure 9.

Reprinted in terms of Creative Commons licence (CC BY- NC). oscillation is in good agreement with the CFD simula- tion. Unfortunately, numerical errors grow and, after about 35 /C 28 unphysical oscillations are observed. Such numerical instabilities occur irregularly at diﬀerent plenum lengths and for diﬀerent ANNs. These oscilla- tions can be identiﬁed as its dominant frequency fu lies outside the interval 0 < fu < 800 Hz. In Figure 10, the corresponding data are highlighted with squares. The variance of the prediction made by the ANNs identiﬁed on data set 5 is signiﬁcantly smaller than the prediction made by the ANNs identiﬁed on the other data sets. Only the results of one of these ANNs diverge. This behaviour shows that the prediction of the ANNs improves when longer time series are used to train the ANN. The ANNs identiﬁed on data set 5 over-predict the RMS values for short plenum lengths and under-predict the values for long plenum lengths. Nevertheless, the trend of the RMS values is captured. However, the prediction of the maximum heat release ﬂuctuation is poor for long plenum lengths. Only the Figure 10.

This shows that the results of this ANN diverge for short plenum lengths. 5 Conclusion The capability of ANNs to serve as a model structure in order to deduce nonlinear low-order models of a lam- inar ﬂame from a CFD simulation was investigated. Via a parameter study a large number of ANNs were identiﬁed. A set of 10 optimal ANNs was selected with a ﬁt criterion. The ﬁt criterion only used broadband time series. This allows to evaluate the ﬁt criterion eﬃ- ciently, since the data used to train the ANNs can be used. Comparing the 10 optimal ANNs allows to esti- mate the uncertainty of the prediction. At ﬁrst the capability of the ANNs to predict the forced response of the ﬂame was analysed. Reasonable agreement was achieved. This shows that over ﬁtting was successfully avoided by the procedure applied to identify and select the optimal ANNs. The validation of the forced response depends strongly on the excitation signal. Therefore, an additional criterion was investigated. The ANNs identiﬁed were combined with a thermoacoustic network model in order to model self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. This compari- son is very close to the application. At several working points unphysical numerical instabilities were predicted by the ANNs. It was shown that the variance of the results decreases if very long-time series are used to identify the ANNs. The ANNs identiﬁed on the longest of the investigated time series were able to predict the trend of the RMS values. However, the prediction of the maximal ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate was still poor. Therefore, we conclude that ANNs, in combination with the identiﬁcation procedure applied in the present study, do not have the desired properties to deduce nonlinear low-order models from a CFD simulation. The main problem of the approach is that a good prediction of the forced response does not guarantee a good prediction of self-excited oscillations. This is because the forced response can be analysed for par- ticular excitation signals only. Additionally, in order to obtain an advantage in computational time this signal should be as short as possible. In the present study the longest signal was 30 times longer than a signal needed to determine the FTF. Longer time series would be prohibitively expensive for practical applications. For the present study the implementation of ANNs provided by Matlab has been used. We consider this implementation as well-established state of the art. The ANN community is rapidly growing and develops a huge number of ANN algorithms, which have their own pros and cons. One of these algorithms may yield better results than the implementation provided by Matlab. This cannot be excluded and is possibly one way to overcome the issues discussed in the present work. Another way to improve the results could be to use diﬀerent types of exci- tation signal, e.g. one could use data from simulated self- excited thermoacoustic oscillations. In the author’s opin- ion, however, more sophisticated white- or grey-box models, that account for the physics of the ﬂame dynam- ics more accurately, are necessary. An additional advan- tage of grey-box models is that also other information besides the time series ofu 0 and _q 0 can be used. For exam- ple Jaensch et al 32 additionally used the acoustic waves emitted by the ﬂame. Regardless of the way a model was obtained, it should be validated by the systematic procedure pro- posed in the present study. In particular, the models should be compared in terms of self-excited oscillations.

Coupling between acoustic perturbation, unsteady heat release rate and temper- ature inhomogeneities may lead to instabilities, which are detrimental for combustors lifespan and cycle operability. This work focuses on the 1-D network model approach, which is proved to correctly predict the unstable acoustic modes of complex combustion systems. The thesis ﬁrst focuses on the analytical aspects of the jump conditions and, in particular, the physical mechanisms to be considered when treating the heat source as a compact discontinuity. Indeed, premixed ﬂames and heat exchangers are based on different heat release mechanisms and need to be treated differently in an acoustic network. Linear 1-D acoustic relations are de- rived for moving heat sources (e.g. premixed ﬂame) and heat sinks at rest (e.g. heat exchangers). By means of these equations, the relation between upstream velocity, air/fuel ratio perturbations, unsteady heat release rate and downstream acoustics and entropy generation has been clariﬁed. The second part of this thesis is speciﬁcally focused on the acoustic behavior of a real-life heat exchanger. Similarly to ﬂames, heat sinks can also trigger thermoacoustic instability effects, since they exhibit unsteady heat release rate in presence of acoustic perturbations. First, nu- merical study of a real-life heat exchanger is carried out, in order to analyze the impact of the unsteady heat release rate and the geometry on the total scattering behavior. Finally, a thermoa- coustic system featuring a 2 D ﬂame and a cold heat exchanger in cross-ﬂow is investigated numerically. v vi Zusammenfassung Thermoakustische Instabilitäten sind ein entscheidendes Problem bei der Entwicklung vorgemischter Magerverbrennungssysteme. Die gegenseitige Wechselwirkung zwischen akustischen Störungen, schwankender Wärmefreisetzungsrate und Temperaturinhomogenitäten kann zu Instabilitäten führen, welche abträglich für die Lebensdauer und Funktionsfähigkeit eines Verbrenners sind. Diese Arbeit konzentriert sich auf den Ansatz mittels eines eindimen- sionalen Netzwerkmodells, wobei bewiesen wird dass dieser die instabilen akustischen Moden komplexer Verbrennungssysteme richtig vorhersagt. Die Arbeit fokusiert sich zunächst auf die analytischen Aspekte der Sprungstellen und ins- besondere auf die physikalischen V orgänge die in bei der Behandlung der Wärmequelle als kompakte Unstetigkeit in Betracht gezogen werden müssen. Tatsächlich basieren vorgemis- chte Flammen und Wärmetauscher auf verschiedenen Mechanismen der Wärmefreisetzung und müssen in einem akustischen Netzwerk unterschiedlich behandelt warden. Sowohl für sich be- wegende Wärmequellen (z.B. vorgemischte Flammen), als auch für ruhende Wärmeableiter (z.B. Wärmetauscher) werden lineare eindimensionale akustische Relationen hergeleitet. Mit Hilfe dieser Formeln wurde die Beziehung zwischen Austrittsgeschwindigkeit, Schwankungen im Luft/Kraftstoff Verhältnis, schwankender Wärmefreisetzungsrate, rückströmender akustis- cher Störungen und Entropieerzeugung geklärt. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit fokusiert sich speziﬁsch auf das akustische Verhalten real ex- istierender Wärmetauscher. Ähnlich wie Flammen können auch Wärmeableiter thermoakustis- che Instabilitäten herbeiführen, da auch bei diesen die Wärmefreisetzung durch den Einﬂuss akustischer Störungen schwankt. Zunächst wird ein real existierender Wärmetauscher mit nu- merischen Methoden studiert. Das Ziel dieser Studie ist den Einﬂuss einer schwankenden Wärmeausstossrate und der Geometrie auf das gesamte Streuverhalten zu analysieren. Ab- schließend wird ein thermoakustisches System mit einer zweidimensionalen Flamme und ein kalter Wärmetauscher mit Querströmung numerisch untersucht. vii viii Contents 1 Introduction 1 1.01 Thermoacoustic instabilities. 1 1.02 Thermo-acoustic characterization of heat exchangers. 3 1.03 Flames and heat exchangers. 4 2 Analytic background 7 2.01 Linear acoustics. 7 2.02 Network model. 8 2.02.01 Total system matrix and stability criterion. 10 2.02.02 Compactness. 11 2.02.03 Rankine-Hugoniot equations. 11 2.02.03.01 Jump conditions for a generic heat source at rest. 12 2.02.03.02 Special case of premixed ﬂames. 13 2.02.04 Validity of network model approach. 14 2.02.05 Temperature inhomogeneities in the network models. 15 3 Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems 17 3.01 Analysis approach. 17 3.01.01 Flame transfer function: Single Input-Single Output approach. 18 3.01.02 Identiﬁcation of LTI models. 19 3.01.02.01 An example of model parametrization. 21 3.01.03 Acoustic scattering matrix: Single Input-Multi Output and Multi Input- Multi Output approach. 21 3.02 Unsteady time series: implicit and explicit time scheme. 22 4 Summary of papers 25 4.01 ICSV 21: On the jump conditions for ﬂow perturbations across a moving heat source. 26 4.02 Combust.

It is a highly undesirable effect, since it limits the system operational efﬁciency and can lead to structural failure in the combustor hardware (see Fig. 1.01). Such instability originates from the coupling between the acoustic disturbances, and the unsteady heat release at the heat source. The presence of acoustic perturbations (i.e ﬂuctuations in pressure and velocity) upstream the heat source leads to unsteady heat release rate, which in return generates further acoustic oscillations. These oscillations propagate away from the heat source, and are reﬂected back at the outer boundaries of the combustor. This results in a closed feedback loop, which may lead to higher unsteady oscillations at the heat source and generate instabilities in the entire system. The presence of acoustic perturbations upstream the heat source can also cause the so-called\"entropy waves\", which are temperature inhomogeneities in the burnt gases propagating down- stream at the convective ﬂow speed. Marble and Candel have shown that, when such in- homogeneities are accelerated by a nozzle or turbine blades, acoustic oscillations are produced at the acceleration zone. The component propagating in the direction upstream travels back into the combustor, and contributes to low-frequency oscillations. Acoustic perturbation gener- ated from entropy waves are also know as indirect combustion noise. It is a critical problem in the aeroengines and afterburners, in which indirect combustion noise causes the \"reheat buzz\"phenomenon. Figure 1.01: Picture of a intact (left) and damaged (right) burner.

Green arrows repre- sent the direct combustion noise due to the coupling between unsteady heat release rate and acoustics. The orange arrows represent the indirect combustion noise, due to entropy waves accelerated by the downstream chocked nozzle. acoustic network model. In this approach, each element of the thermoa- coustic system (e.g. ﬂame, area changes, ducts) are seen as single subsystems, which are char- acterized in terms of acoustic scattering properties upstream and downstream. Speciﬁcally, the acoustic scattering matrix relates the acoustic waves impinging on the element to the compo- nents reﬂected and transmitted by the element itself. In this approach, the quality of the predic- tions strictly depends on the modeling of the single elements. Therefore, the correct prediction of the source terms for direct and indirect acoustics is essential, as entropy waves and heat release ﬂuctuations are the driving force for acoustic oscillations, and the main source of insta- bilities. A correct prediction of instabilities is vital for the application of passive or active control systems on the burner. Passive control consist in damping elements, such as perforated plates, Helmholtz resonators, or modiﬁcation of the combustor geometry. Active control, instead, con- sists in imposing varying acoustic signals, which interact destructively with the self-excited 1.02 Thermo-acoustic characterization of heat exchangers oscillations in the system. 1.02 Thermo-acoustic characterization of heat exchangers The topic of the present dissertation is part of the TANGO project (Thermo and Aeroacoustic Non-linearities in Green combustors with Oriﬁce structures). TANGO is a Marie Curie Initial Training Network, funded by European Commission and features a consortium of scientiﬁc institutions across all Europe and India. The scope of the project is to develop and implement solutions to prevent thermoacoustic instabilities in green combustors. This work originates from one aspect of the research activities in TANGO. It focuses on the unsteady behavior of heat sinks, such as cold heat exchangers, in a thermoacoustic systems. Indeed, the most part of thermoacoustics literature has focused on ﬂames, since they represent the main source of thermoacoustic instabilities. Instead, little is known about the thermoa- coustic behavior of cooling elements, despite their broad application in combustion systems. This is because heat subtraction has always been associated to damping (i.e. stabilizing) effects. However, this assumption is not always correct. The original work by Rayleigh on the instability criterion reads as follows:\"If heat be communicated to, and abstracted from, a mass of air vibrating (for example) in a cylinder bounded by a piston, the effect produced will depend upon the phase of the vibration at which the transfer of heat takes place. If heat be given to the air at the moment of greatest condensation, or be taken from it at the moment of greatest rarefaction, the vibration is encouraged. On the other hand, if heat be given at the moment of greatest rarefaction, or abstracted at the moment of greatest condensation, the vibration is discouraged.\"The well-known Rayleigh criterion, which is a consequence of the previous statement, expresses the necessary (but non sufﬁcient) condition for instabilities to arise: G = ∫ V ∫ T ˙q′(x, t)p′(x, t) d t d x > 0, (1.01) where p′(x, t) is the pressure oscillation, ˙q′(x, t) is the heat release rate ﬂuctuation, T is the oscillation cycle period and V is the control volume, in which heat release takes place. For the Rayleigh index G to be greater than zero, positive heat release rate oscillations should occur at the moment of highest compression, while negative oscillations should take place at the moment of greatest rarefaction. Such condition may be veriﬁed for ﬂames as well as for heat exchangers. Therefore, depending on the phase between pressure and heat release rate ﬂuctuations, a heat exchanger may also trigger or damp instabilities. The ﬁrst observation of the thermoacoustic effect in heat subtraction was documented by J. Bosscha, who noticed that sound could be produced also when hot air ﬂows over a cold screen. Apart from the unsteady heat release rate, another interesting aspect of heat exchangers is to be found in the geometry. The presence of a several tube bundles in a combustion system cer- tainly introduces a blockage effect with acoustic scattering, which could also contribute to the Introduction thermoacoustic instabilities. 1.03 Flames and heat exchangers As shown in Fig. 1.02, active elements in a thermoacoustic system are characterized by their un- steady heat release rate ˙Q′ 1 or their entropy generated downstreams′ 2. Across the discontinuity, no information is provided on the mechanism of heat release, or the kind of heat source involved. Indeed, ﬂames and heat exchangers have different heat release (or heat transfer) mechanisms. Does the black-box approach adopted in the previous literature correctly predict the downstream acoustics and entropy? Or should the heat release mechanism be accounted for in the analytical modeling of heat sources? An answer to these questions was given by Chu, who stated that the\"chief difference between a ﬂame and a heat exchanger lies in the fact that, for a ﬂame, the relative velocity between ﬂame front and incoming ﬂow is not known and is related to the ﬂame speed, whereas for a heater, such relative velocity is assumed to be given.\"The time-varying\"relative velocity between ﬂame front and incoming ﬂow\"is the consequence of the kinematic balance, which is present in the combustion process of the premix ﬂames, while heat exchangers are ﬁxed, and not subject to any kinematic balance.

Downstream perturbations u′ 2, p′ 2,ρ′ 2 are re- lated to the oscillations upstream and to the unsteady heat release rate ˙Q′. In the case of a moving heat source, the relative velocity of the ﬂame front with respect to the ﬁxed observer is given byus (t). In linear regime, the ﬂame oscillates around the mean ﬂame position ¯x f. For a heat source at rest, the velocity of the heat source in the laboratory frame is zerous (t) = 0, thus the location of the source,¯x f, is constant in time. In the present dissertation, analytical studies of jump conditions for ﬁxed and moving heat sources have been ﬁrst carried out. The main focus of the analytical work are the para- 1 ˙Q is the volume integral of ˙q(x). ˙Q = ∫ V ˙q(x)d x 1.03 Flames and heat exchangers doxical results in terms of entropy production in the jump conditions for a heat source at rest (especially at zero Mach), and the resolution of such apparent contradiction by applying a modiﬁed version of the jump equations to premixed ﬂames. The results of the new analytical relations are then validated against unsteady direct numerical simulations. After assessing the differences in modeling between ﬂames and heat exchangers, the analysis focuses on the acoustic scattering properties of a real-life heat exchanger, used in domestic boilers. The goal is to understand the overall scattering properties of a heat exchanger with optimized geom- etry and heat transfer efﬁciency, and the validity of the network model approach in predicting the scattering behavior of a non-compact heat exchanger. Finally, the analysis of a thermoa- coustic system featuring both heat source (premixed ﬂame) and heat sink in cross-ﬂow has been carried out. Introduction chapters give the theoretical background for the work carried out in the papers. Chapter 2 gives the analytical background for linear acoustic conservation equations across a heat source. It also focuses on the different formulation found in literature for the cases of moving heat sources (e.g. premixed ﬂame) and those at rest (e.g. heat exchangers). Chapter 3, on the other hand, gives an overview of the approaches to unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems, and the system identiﬁcation process. Introduction 2 Analytic background In this chapter, the analytical modeling of acoustic scattering and propagation across heat sources and ducts are introduced. These analytical models describe the single subsystems (e.g. ﬂame, duct, area change) which interact acoustically in a larger network model, which describes the complex systems, such as combustion chambers. The aim of this chapter is to show how sys- tems stability can be determined starting from the acoustic relations in the network model. 2.01 Linear acoustics Acoustic waves consist in small disturbances in pressure and velocity, which propagate in a gaseous medium. The small amplitude allows for linearization of the quantities of interest: p′(x, t) = p(x, t) − ¯p(x); u′(x, t) = u(x, t) − ¯u(x); ρ′(x, t) = ρ(x, t) − ¯ρ(x); (2.01) where the overbar denotes the mean quantity, and the superscript denotes the perturbation quan- tity. The propagation of such perturbations takes place at the speed of soundc, which is function of the thermophysical properties of the medium and temperature: c = √ γRT, (2.02) where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats ( γ = cp /cv ) and R is the ratio between the universal gas constant and the molecular weight of the gas (R = Runi v /M). The propagation of acoustic waves in the medium can be considered as inviscid and non-dissipative. Therefore, the relation between acoustic perturbation p′,ρ′ and speed of sound is: c 2 = p′ ρ′. (2.03) The propagation of such perturbations in presence of uniform mean ﬂow inx-direction, without source terms, is described by the wave equation : ( ∂ ∂t + ¯u ∂ ∂x )2 p′ − c 2 ∇2 p′ = 0. (2.04) The solution for plane waves to the equation above is given by: p′(x, t) ¯ρ ¯c = f (x, t) + g (x, t), u′(x, t) = (f (x, t) −g (x, t)), (2.05) Analytic background where f and g are the Riemann invariants, i.e. complex-valued acoustic waves propagating in the positive (f ) and negative x-direction (g ): f = ˆF ·exp ( −i k+x +i ωt ) g = ˆG ·exp ( −i k−x +i ωt ). (2.06) In Eq. (2.06), ˆF and ˆG are the amplitudes of the acoustic waves f and g. k+ and k− are the wave numbers in the positive and negativex−directions, respectively. The wave numberk± is related to the angular frequency ω, the speed of sound c = √ γRT and Mach number M as: k± = ±ω/c 1 ±M. (2.07) In case of zero mean ﬂow, the wave number simpliﬁes to: k = ω/c. 2.02 Network model As observed in, thermoacoustic instabilities are not a local, but a global phenomenon. In fact, acoustic waves travel in the combustor and are reﬂected at boundaries and discontinuities. Therefore, conditions at the boundaries of a thermoacoustic system (e.g. combustion chamber walls, nozzles) can inﬂuence the stability of the heat source, even if the elements involved are far away from each other. Real thermoacoustic systems feature complex geometries and extensive domains. The use of full-scale CFD tools for determining the thermoacoustic behavior of the total system can be certainly computationally challenging. This is the reason why more efﬁcient low-order network models are used for the prediction of thermoacoustic instability. The strategy of network modeling is to divide complex geometries found in real combustors in several subsystems. This approach is advantageous, because in simple elements, such as ducts or temperature jump, acoustic waves propagation can be modeled analytically by linearizing the conservation equations. The acoustic waves propagating in the system is assumed as plane waves. Such assumption is valid, since in linear thermoacoustics the frequency range of inter- est is always lower than the cut-on frequency, so all the transversal modes decay exponentially. A simple model featuring a plane ﬂame in a duct can be divided in 3 elements, as repre- sented in Fig. 2.01 and 2.02: an upstream duct (1-2), an active heat source (2-3) and a downstream duct (3-4). The relations between the incoming and outgoing characteristic waves (respectively f 1, g 2 and f 2, g 1 for D 1) in each element is given by the speciﬁc scattering matrix of the element. According to, the acoustic elements can be classiﬁed in three categories : • One-port element (such as\"open end\" boundary condition in Fig. 2.02 ), characterized only by a connection at one side of the element; • Two-port connecting elements, typically ducts, which feature a certain length in the di- rection of wave propagation. 2.02 Network model 𝑥\"𝑥 = 0 𝑥 = 𝐿 41 2 3 Figure 2.01: Simple thermoacoustic system featuring a plane ﬂame in a duct with open ends D 1 D 2 𝑓\" 𝑓# 𝑓$ 𝑓% 𝑔\"𝑔# 𝑔$ 𝑔% Open end open end Figure 2.02: Corresponding network modeling of the system in Fig. 2.01. The model is divided into 3 subsystems (upstream duct, ﬂame, downstream duct), which lie between the two open-end acoustic boundary conditions • Two-port connecting nodes, i.e. discontinuities with negligible axial extension, such as temperature discontinuity or sudden area changes From a cause-effect perspective, characteristic waves approaching the acoustic element (fu, gd ) are related to the outgoing waves ( fd, gu ) through the scattering matrix SM. The elements on the matrix diagonal represent the transmission coefﬁcients of the element, while off-diagonal coefﬁcients represent the reﬂection properties. ( ˆFd ˆGu ) = (Tu Rd Ru Td )    S ( ˆFu ˆGd ). (2.08) The propagation of acoustic plane waves in a lossless duct of lengthx f, like element D 1 in Fig. 2.02, is expressed as : ( ˆF 2 ˆG 1 ) = (e−i k+x f 0 0 e−i k−(x f ) )    Sduct ( ˆF 1 ˆG 2 ), (2.09) where x f is the length of the duct. In absence of damping effects, the amplitude of the acoustic waves entering the duct remains constant, and outgoing and incoming waves only differ by the acoustic time-delay τ = x f /c(1 ±M). In addition to Eq. (2.08), the acoustic properties of a two-port element can be also reformulated as transfer matrix. Transfer matrix relates the downstream waves in terms of f and g to the Analytic background upstream waves: ( ˆFd ˆGu ) = Tf g · ( ˆFu ˆGd ). (2.010) Recalling Eqs. (2.05) - (2.06), transfer matrix in Eq. (2.010) can also be reformulated in terms of up- and downstream pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations: (p′ u′ ) d = Tpu · (p′ u′ ) u. (2.011) The algebraic relations between different formulations of the acoustic scattering/transfer matrix S, Tf g and Tpu can be found in. 2.02.01 Total system matrix and stability criterion The transfer matrix of the total acoustic system can be obtained by simply multiplying the transfer matrix of the single elements in series: Ts y s = Tn · Tn−1 ·. · T 1.

The stability of the system is frequency-dependent, and can be established by solving the characteristic equation: det [ Ts y s (Ω)] = 0 (2.013) The solutions of the characteristic equation are the complex eigenfrequencies of the system: Ωei g = ωei g +i α (2.014) According to the convention adopted in Eq. (2.06) for the time dependency, the system is stable if the imaginary part of the eigenvalues α > 0, condition which leads to the exponential decay of the perturbations in the system. 2.02 Network model 2.02.02 Compactness As mentioned in Section 2.02, the connecting nodes are discontinuities with negligible axial extension. The ratio between the thickness of the discontinuity and the acoustic wavelength is represented by the dimensionless Helmholtz number He. When the condition: He = ωL c = 2π λ L << 1 (2.015) is veriﬁed, the element is deﬁned as acoustically\"compact\". Compactness can be deﬁned also w.r.t. the convective velocity. Such criterion is useful in the analysis of entropy waves propagation/generation across discontinuities, since temperature in- homogeneities propagate at ﬂow speed. In this case, the velocity of propagation in Eq. (2.015) is the convective speed | ¯u|, and not the speed of sound, c. When acoustic or convective compact- ness is satisﬁed, it is possible to derive the scattering properties of the discontinuity by applying the conservation equations right up- and downstream the jump. Matching conditions can be therefore derived, even without giving a detailed description of the ﬂow through the jump. 2.02.03 Rankine-Hugoniot equations In the modeling of 1 D acoustics, the matching conditions across compact, active heat sources is obtained by applying the \"Rankine-Hugoniot\"relations to the conservation equations. The\"Rankine-Hugoniot\" equations are well-known in gasdynamics for describing jump conditions across shock waves. For a shock waves propagating in a medium with velocityus, the Rankine- Hugoniot relations for conserved quantities between upstream and downstream the shock is : us = f 2(ϕ) − f 1(ϕ) ϕ2 −ϕ1, (2.016) where ϕ2 and ϕ1 are the conserved quantity before and after the discontinuity and f 2(ϕ) and f 1(ϕ) are the ﬂux functions of ϕ. The condition above can indeed be applied to the conserved quantities across active acoustic heat sources, which feature an additional source term in the energy conservation equation, ˙Q′, the unsteady response in heat release rate in presence of acoustic perturbations. Thanks to the compactness hypothesis, the quasi-steady, incompressible conservation equations can be applied. Applying Eq. (2.016) to the Euler equations, it follows for mass, momentum and energy: us (ρd − ρu ) = (ρd ud − ρu uu ) us (ρd ud − ρu uu ) = (ρd u 2 d + pd − ρu u 2 u − pu ) us (ρd Ed − ρu Eu ) = (ρd ud Hd − ρu uu Hu − ˙Q). (2.017) Subscript -u and -d deﬁne the conditions right up- and downstream the discontinuity, respec- tively; while E is the total energy and H is the total enthalpy 1. Linear acoustic perturbation 1 the relation between E and H is expressed as follows: H = E + p ρ = e + 1 2 u 2 + p ρ = h + 1 2 u 2 (2.018) Analytic background pertains to small oscillations in pressure and velocity ( p′,u′). They cause all the relevant vari- ables in the ﬂow to oscillate around their mean value. Therefore, it is possible to decompose any variable in a mean component, which varies only in space, and a ﬂuctuating component, which ﬂuctuates in both space and time: φ(x, t) = ¯φ(x) + φ′(x, t). (2.019) 2.02.03.01 Jump conditions for a generic heat source at rest By linearizing the conservation equations in (2.017) and retaining only the ﬂuctuating compo- nents, it is possible to derive the matching conditions across an active source (for detailed deriva- tion, see Appendix of ). In literature, it is often assumed that the heat source is ﬁxed at an axial position (see x f in Fig. 2.02), therefore us = 0. The acoustic conservation equations are written as : [ρ′ ¯u +u′ ¯ρ]2 1 = 0, [p′ +ρ′ ¯u 2 +2 ¯ρ ¯uu′]2 1 = 0, [cp ¯T (ρ′ ¯u +u′ ¯ρ) + ¯ρ ¯u(cp T ′ + ¯uu′)]2 1 = ˙Q′. (2.020) After these consideration, we obtain for the jump conditions across a ﬁxed heat source: u′ 2 = u′ 1 + ¯u 1 (λ−1) ( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q − p′ ¯p 1 ) +O(M 2) p′ 2 = p′ 1 +O(M 2) (2.021) As it is implied in the compactness assumption, the dynamics at the ﬂame front are not included in the equations. The only term describing the unsteady response of the heat source is ˙Q′, the ﬂuctuating heat release rate. As proved by several works in literature, the un- steady heat release at heat sources such as ﬂame and heat exchangers is sensitive to velocity. In frequency domain, the unsteady heat release rate ˙Q′ caused by velocity perturbations(u′) is represented by the frequency-dependent ﬂame transfer function: F (ω) = ˙Q′(ω) ¯˙Q / u′ 1(ω) ¯u 1. (2.022) In frequency domain, the Eqs. (2.021) above can be therefore formulated as: u′ 2 = u′ 1 (1 +(λ−1)F (ω)) +O(M 2) p′ 2 = p′ 1 +O(M 2). (2.023) The term p′ 1/ ¯p 1 has been neglected since the normalizes pressure oscillations are much smaller than the velocity perturbations: p′ ¯p = O(γ ¯M)u′ ¯u. (2.024) 2.02 Network model 2.02.03.02 Special case of premixed ﬂames The case of a premixed ﬂame requires some special considerations. In most 1-D models, com- pact ﬂames are modeled as a sudden discontinuity across which unburnt cold premixture be- come burnt hot gases (see Fig. 2.01). However, by looking at the Fig. 2.03, which was ﬁrst pro- posed in Blackshear’s work in 1953, the ﬂame features three separate zones. The zone A 1 (with duct width A 1), is the upstream zone where only cold premixture exists. The zone A 2 (with duct width A 2 ) is where only burnt gases exist. The mass conservation for these two zones can be expressed by the continuity equation in in Eqs. (2.020). Between A 1 and A 2, however, the premixture and burnt gases coexist in the ﬂame zone. Considering the ﬂow as incompressible, the mass ﬂow conservation for the ﬂame zone can be written as : A 1 u 1(t) = A f (t)S f + ∂Vf (t) ∂t, (2.025) A 2 u 2(t) = A f (t)S f ρ1 ρ2 + ∂Vf (t) ∂t, (2.026) where S f, A f, Vf are the ﬂame burning speed, the ﬂame area and ﬂame volume, respectively. The presence of velocity perturbations upstream may lead to ﬂame-stretching (see the dashed white line in Fig. 2.03), due to the instantaneous imbalance between incoming premixture and mass burning rate at the ﬂame surface. As a consequence, both the ﬂame area and the ﬂame volume increase. The increase in ﬂame area, on the other hand, compensates for the higher incoming mass ﬂow, so that a new equilibrium condition can be established. This adaptive behavior of the ﬂame front leads to a balance between up- and downstream as: A 2 u 2(t) − A 1 u 1(t) = A f (t)S f (ρ1 ρ2 −1 ) (2.027) Figure 2.03: A ducted ﬂame can be divided in 3 zones: an upstream zone (with duct cross-section A 1), a downstream zone (with duct cross-section A 2), and a ﬂame zone, in which burnt and unburnt gases co-exist. The white dashed line highlights the proﬁle of the ﬂame when it stretches under velocity perturbations Analytic background With respect to Eq. (2.020), the relation above accounts for the movement of the discontinuity itself. This shows that the hypothesis of a discontinuity at rest is not valid for premixed ﬂames. With the movement of the discontinuity, two aspects have to be considered, when analyzing the Figure 2.04: 1 D modeling of the ﬂame in Fig. 2.03. The space-averaged position of the ﬂame front varies in time (x f (t)) stability of thermoacoustic systems. First, the position of the source changes in time (see Fig. 2.04). This affects the propagation of acoustic waves and therefore the stability behavior of the system. This aspect in non-linear ﬂames has been analyzed by Luzzato, who consid- ered the effects on stability of ﬂame displacement. The other problem pertains the inﬂuence of the ﬂame front movement ( A′ f,V ′ f,∂Vf (t)/∂t) on the scattering and generation of acoustic and entropy waves. The latter aspect is analyzed in the present work [54–56]. 2.02.04 Validity of network model approach Network models can be a very powerful tool for predicting thermoacoustic instabilities. They are generally applied to systems in which plane waves are involved, but application to higher order modes is also possible (see,). The validity of the acoustic network and the accuracy of the predictions on stability depend mainly on the precision of the single identiﬁed elements. Indeed, the scattering matrix of single elements might change, when the distance between the subsystems decrease and elements can mutually inﬂuence each other’s scattering properties. A good example is found in the case of the premixed ﬂame with a heat exchanger in cross-ﬂow. When the distance between the two active elements (see Fig. 2.05) decreases, the ﬂame tip impinges on the cylindrical shell of the heat exchanger, and mean-ﬂow interactions occur. In such situation, the juxtaposition of the scattering matrix extrapolated from single elements (ﬂame, heat exchanger) do not equal the scattering behavior identiﬁed for the joint system. 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 ICSV 21, Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 6 Figure 9. Velocity vectors and reaction rate contour. The flow v elocity has been monitored at different locations on the flame axis. The location corresponding to the bottom side of the burner deck has been chosen for calculation of the transfer function due to better compatibility to the future experiments. The sum of heat relea se rate in the domain and the heat flux through heat exchanger and burner deck surfaces have been monitored dur- ing calculations. The flame transfer function has been calculated for all the cases considering the selected loca- tion velocity as excitation and the total reaction heat release rate as response. The variations of the excitation and response signals as function of time for the high load cases are plotted in Fig. 10. The excitation takes place at 120 ms and it can be seen that the ideal step profile at the inlet changes to a smoother profile before the burner deck due to area change and flow straining. The heat release rate decreases as the heat exchanger approaches the burner deck, which has been expected due to increased flame cooling. Figure 11 shows another representation of the heat release rate time series. In this figure, all the values have been normalized with respect to their corresponding values before excitation. Moreover, time has been shifted to zero for convenience. It can b e observed that all cases behave similarly, except the most deviating case with flame impingement. The peak value for the relative heat release rate in this case is lower and also happens around 1 ms later compared to the other cases. In addition, the normalized values for all the cases converge to 1.005, which corresponds to the excitation ampli- tude. But for the impinging case reaches a value of 1.0053, which can be a sign of some degree of offset in the system that needs to be investigated further. Figure 10.

The presence of a cold cylinder downstream the ﬂame may inﬂuence the velocity ﬁeld and thus the response of the ﬂame to acoustics. On the other hand, close to the ﬂame tip the velocity shows a non-uniform proﬁle, which could also inﬂuence the behavior of the heat exchanger. The validity of this speciﬁc network model is therefore limited to distances at which such interactions do not take place. 2.02.05 Temperature inhomogeneities in the network models In the analysis of network models, the presence of temperature inhomogeneities should also be taken into account. This is because perturbations in temperature, which travel at convective speed, may also inﬂuence the propagation of the acoustic waves. In fact, the speed of sound depends on temperature, and the deviations from the homogeneous mean temperature ﬁeld may lead to different stability behavior in the system. The inﬂuence of temperature inhomogeneities is even more important, when a chocked noz- zle is placed downstream the unsteady heat source. The acceleration of temperature inhomo- geneities represents a source for indirect acoustic perturbations. An indirect component of re- ﬂected acoustic waves ( gi nd in Fig. 2.07) may add up to the upstream traveling component of direct acoustic wave (gd ) and lead to changes in system stability. Figure 2.07:\"Hot-\"and\"cold spots\"may be generated downstream an unsteady heat source. These entropy waves (sd ) are reﬂected as acoustic perturbation (gi nd )at the chocked nozzle Therefore, in addition to the relations for acoustic variables, the Rankine-Hugoniot equations should also account for entropy variables, such as density or temperature perturbations. Only then, the acoustic source and propagation in the network model are modeled correctly and com- prehensively. Analytic background 3 Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems In realistic geometries and systems, an analytical formulation which accounts for all the physical mechanisms contributing to the global scattering behavior of the acoustic elements cannot be achieved for every case. Propagation and scattering of acoustic waves are in fact subject to effects such as acoustic damping, vortex shedding, ﬂow inertia. In ﬂames, several effects concur to the unsteady heat release rate (ﬂame area change, ﬂame thickening, wall-ﬂame interaction, etc.) and an analytical model for ˙Q(t) cannot be easily found. Therefore, while identifying the scattering behavior of the elements, applying the quasi-steady acoustic conservation equations is not sufﬁcient. Instead, experimental measurements and numerical simulation are more often adopted. In this chapter, we will introduce the existing approaches in identifying the system response in the linear regime, from a\"black-box\"perspective. Figure 3.01: A system characterized by its output (y(t)), input (x(t)) and disturbance signal(v(t)). 3.01 Analysis approach In the black-box approach, the physical mechanisms of acoustic scattering are not explicitly accounted for. Instead, the dynamics of the acoustic element is characterized only by the system response (output) to external excitation signals (input). In the present work, only the linear, causal, time invariant systems are considered. Time- invariance implies that the system’s response does not depend explicitly on time. Therefore, if a signal x(t) produces a response y(t), the same input applied at time t +τ will produce the same response y(t), with a delay of τ. The system behavior can therefore be described by the Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems impulse response convolution function: y(t) = ∫ +∞ g (τ)x(t −τ)dτ, (3.01) where g (τ) is the impulse response (or weighting function) of the system. Causality implies that the response of the system y(t) depends only on present and past excita- tion signals x(t −τ), and not on future inputs, so τ ≥ 0. Linearity of the system implies that the relation between input and the output remains constant, and does not depend on the input signal magnitude or frequency. Moreover, the frequency of the system response should correspond to the excitation signal frequency. Time-invariance implies that the system can be entirely characterized by time delays. This means that the system response to a discrete time series xt can be expressed as: yt = b 0 xt + b 1 xt−1 +. + b N xt−N, (3.02) and the transfer function G(q) can be written as : G(q) = N∑ n=0 bn q−n, (3.03) where q is the shift operator, so: q−n xt = xt−n. Here, a ﬁnite integer is used (N ), instead of ∞, because we assume that the response of the systems becomes negligible for n > N. G(q) is the transfer operator of the system, since: y(t) =G(q)x(t). (3.04) Similarly, when disturbance is present, a transfer operator can be deﬁned for v(t): v(t) = H(q)e(t) H(q) = N∑ n=0 hn q−n, (3.05) where e(t) is white noise, characterized by a speciﬁc PDF, and H(q) is the transfer operator of the disturbances. The global description of a system with superimposed disturbance will be: y(t) =G(q)u(t) +H(q)e(t). (3.06) 3.01.01 Flame transfer function: Single Input-Single Output approach Linear acoustic perturbations consist of small ﬂuctuations of velocity and pressure in a steady state system. With reference to the numerical setup in Fig. 3.02, at time t = t∗, a small perturba- tion in velocity (and pressure) is imposed to the inlet conditions: u 1(t∗) = ¯u 1 +u′ 1(t∗); → ˙Q(t∗) = ¯˙Q + ˙Q′(t∗); (3.07) 3.01 Analysis approach Figure 3.02: Unsteady upstream perturbation as input signal imposed to a 2 D slit ﬂame. Figure 3.03: Single-Input, Single-Output approach For the characterization of a heat source transfer function F (ω), the corresponding input and output coincide with the velocity ﬂuctuation u′(t) and the heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′(t), respectively. The model which characterizes the heat release response of the heat source is then: F (ω) = ˙Q′(ω) ¯˙Q / u′ 1(ω) ¯u 1. (3.08) For discrete time series, the transfer function corresponds to the Z-transform of the impulse response function G(q): F (ω) = N∑ n=0 bn e−i ω n ∆t, (3.09) where ∆t is the sampling interval and ω is the angular frequency. The identiﬁcation of the transfer function is possible only if the system remains in the linear regime. The classic open and closed end conditions lead to a reﬂection coefﬁcient of magni- tude unity and are not suitable for the identiﬁcation. Instead, the Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Conditions (NSCBC) are often used, since they ensure a quasi non-reﬂective condition at the boundaries, so an open-loop system is achieved, and the perturbations remain in the linear regime. 3.01.02 Identiﬁcation of LTI models As pointed out in Section 3.01, the assumption of linearity implies that a model, when excited by a signal at a certain frequencyf ∗, shall give a response, which is also at frequencyf ∗. It follows that the most straightforward approach in analyzing system’s response is to excite the system with a monofrequent sinusoidal signal and register the response. In Fig. 3.04 the dots represent respectively the magnitude and the phase of the ﬂame transfer function F (ω). The system of Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems reference is the laminar 2 D ﬂame in Fig. 3.02 and 3.05. The transfer function is the ratio between the response ˆ˙Q′(ω)/ ¯˙Q (normalized unsteady heat release rate oscillations ) and the input signal ˆu′(ω)/ ¯u (normalized velocity perturbations at inlet) in frequency domain, according to Eq. (3.08) and (3.01). The transfer function F |u (ω) is the solution to the\"closure problem\"in the Rankine- Hugoniot equations, and the input needed for the ﬂame subsystem in the network model. The monofrequent excitation shows some obvious drawback: for a range of frequencies (e.g. from 0 to 1000 [Hz]) it is necessary to perform n simulations, when n points are needed in the range of interest. This can be computationally expensive, especially when many parameters studies are needed. Figure 3.04: Identiﬁed gain and phase of a perfectly premixed ﬂame transfer function F. The transfer function shows a typical low-pass behaviour, which means that the response in terms of heat release rate ﬂuctuations are higher when then upstream acoustic excitation have low frequencies. In this case, the function is identiﬁed by using monofrequent (dots) and broad- band (line) signals as excitation. For laminar ﬂow ﬁelds, it is possible to apply the same approach by using a multi-sinusoidal, or a step-function, as input signal. However, the step-function needs higher computational efforts to be well resolved. Moreover, most ﬂows and ﬂames found in real combustors are turbulent and may show small random oscillations which cannot be attributed to acoustic perturbations. In these cases, a simple Fourier transform of the input signal and system response may give incorrect predictions for the system transfer function. It is then necessary to account for the presence of the additional disturbances in the model. 3.01 Analysis approach Figure 3.05: Excitation signals as input: step function (a), random binary broadband signal (b), monofre- quent signal (c). 3.01.02.01 An example of model parametrization A very generic description of the system in terms of input and output can be given by the linear difference equation: y(t) + a 1 y(t −1) + ··· +ana y(t −na ) = b 1 x(t −1) + ··· +bnb x(t −nb ) + e(t), (3.010) where θ = [a 1, ana,b 1,bnb ] are the model parameters to be estimated. Deﬁning the func- tions A(q) and B(q): A(q) = 1 +a 1 q−1 +. +ana q−na B(q) = 1 +b 1 q−1 +. +bnb q−nb. (3.011) According to Eq. (3.06) and (3.010), the time series can be deﬁned as: y(t) = B(q) A(q) x(t) + 1 A(q)e(t) =G(q,θ)x(t) +H(q,θ)e(t). (3.012) The model described above is called\"Autoregressive Exogeneous\" (ARX) model. Note that for the case na = 0, the model reduces to the Finite Impulse Response (see Eq. (3.03)). The ARX model is only one of the many models available for the identiﬁcation of LTI systems, and its description is given here as an example of parametrization for G and H. The most common models such as ARMAX, Output-Error and Box-Jenkins belong to the same family of bloack-box models and are well described in. 3.01.03 Acoustic scattering matrix: Single Input-Multi Output and Multi Input-Multi Output approach For the identiﬁcation of acoustic scattering behavior, the Single Input-Multi Output or the Multi Input-Multi Output approach is used. With reference to the ﬂame in Fig. 3.02 and to the scheme in Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems Fig. 3.06, the system is excited by a signal at the inlet fu, and the outputs are measured in terms of reﬂected wave gu and transmitted wave fd. The upstream reﬂection Ru and transmission coefﬁcient Tu can be identiﬁed. (fd gu ) = (Tu Rd Ru Td )    S (fu gd ). (3.013) A SISO approach in the determination of the scattering matrix implies two separate unsteady Figure 3.06: Single-Input, Multi-Output approach simulations, with broadband excitations imposed separately at the inlet and outlet. A Multi Input-Multi Output allows for the identiﬁcation of the scattering matrix in only one simulation. In this case, the signals imposed at the boundaries should be statistically uncorrelated. Figure 3.07: Multi-Input, Multi-Output approach 3.02 Unsteady time series: implicit and explicit time scheme The unsteady time series are obtained from unsteady simulations starting from a converged solution. In the present work, two different solvers (A VBP 1 and rho Pimple FOAM from Open- FOAM) are used to perform the simulations. We will not focus here on the details of the solvers, since several numerical setups are described in the papers. Instead, we will make some consider- ations on the use of implicit and explicit method in the solution of unsteady transport equations. In the solution of the time-dependent discretized partial and ordinary differential equations, both explicit and implicit methods can be used. In the explicit method, the variable Φ(t +1) 1 http://www.cerfacs.fr/ avbp/A VBP_V 6.X/A VBPHELP/avbphelp.php 3.02 Unsteady time series: implicit and explicit time scheme is an explicit function of the same variable at time t: Φ(t +1) = F (Φ(t)). The implicit method expresses the variableΦ(t +1) as: F (Φ(t),Φ(t +1)) = 0. An example applied to 1-D conservation equations can be found in. In the numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems, an explicit method is useful for resolv- ing the acoustic waves propagation, and the interaction between acoustics, vorticity and entropy. Computationally it may be expensive, since the stability of the computation is limited by the acoustic Courant number : Cacousti c = c ∆t ∆x < 1, (3.014) where c ist the speed of sound, ∆t is the time step and ∆x is the cell size. The condition on Courant number should be satisﬁed for every time step, in the whole numerical domain. For the solver A VBP, the value of 0.07 for Cacousti c is found to be a good compromise between stability and numerical effort. Implicit schemes can as well be adopted for thermoacoustic numerical simulations. Compared to the explicit methods, the implicit methods are more stable, and do not diverge for Courant numbers higher than unity. However, some information on acoustic propagation through the numerical domain might be lost, and the time delay is not accurate. Unsteady numerical simulation of thermoacoustic systems 4 Summary of papers The work carried out in the course of the dissertation research has been published in ﬁve jour- nal and conference papers (including 3 peer-reviewed papers) published in the years 2014-2016. Summary of papers 4.01 ICSV 21: On the jump conditions for ﬂow perturbations across a moving heat source Summary In this paper, we present the analytical framework of 1-D conservation equations for acoustic perturbations across a moving and ﬁxed heat source. In these equations, an additional term, u′ s, has been introduced. u′ s represents the movements of the ﬂame front, which adapts to the incoming velocity ﬂuctuations by changing its surface area. We explain why the kinematic balance and the ﬂame front movement are essential to the prediction of the acoustic scattering behavior. In fact, for a passive ﬂame front ( ˙Q′ = 0) which moves with the incoming velocity perturbations, the velocity jump across the discontinuity is:u′ 2 = u′ 1. In the case of a heat source at rest (e.g. heat exchanger, heated wire) and no heat release rate ﬂuctuations ( ˙Q′ = 0), the jump condition is u′ 2 = ( ¯T 2/ ¯T 1)u′ 1. Contribution I conceived the outline of this paper together with S. Bomberg and Prof. W. Polifke. I con- tributed to the theoretical work with the derivation of the linearized conservation equations up to ﬁrst order in Mach and analyzed the application of the equations to moving heat sources and sources at rest.

Flame 2016: Propagation and generation of acoustic and entropy waves across a moving ﬂame front 4.02 Combust. Flame 2016: Propagation and generation of acoustic and entropy waves across a moving ﬂame front Summary As the previous work, this paper also discusses the linear acoustic conservation equations across a moving heat source. However, in this paper, a deeper insight is given to the conse- quences of the ﬂame front movement. It is ﬁrst shown how the analytic model of the ﬂame at rest cannot be applied to premixed ﬂames, since leads to unphysical prediction on entropy waves generation, and to apparent contradictions in the case of M = 0. Instead, by applying the moving ﬂame front model, it is possible to give a physically sound prediction of the leading or- der entropy waves generation across the ﬂame front. Indeed, in the moving model, temperature inhomogeneities are only related to the upstream ﬂuctuations in equivalence ratio. In absence of equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations, the total heat release rate is governed by the unsteady volume consumption at the ﬂame front, and no ﬂuctuations in temperature is found in burnt gases. The appendix, ﬁnally, elucidates how ﬁrst order entropy terms are generated, even in absence of equivalence ratio perturbations. In this case, the entropy waves (which are negligible for small Mach regimes) are produced from the coupling of upstream acoustic ﬂuctuations p′ 1,u′ 1,T ′ 1 and the mean heat release rate ¯˙Q. Contribution I conceived the outline of this paper together with S. Bomberg and Prof. W. Polifke. I con- tributed to the theoretical work with the interpretation of the entropy source in the linearized acoustic conservation equations. Moreover, I did an extensive literature research in order to compare the formulation used in previous analytical works to the formulation presented in the paper and analyzed the interconnections among the different formulations. As the ﬁrst author, I wrote the draft of the paper and, in quality of corresponding author, I implemented the suggestions made by the reviewers, prepared the rebuttals and submitted the ﬁnal version.

Flame, V ol 166, 170-180, Apr. 2016 Summary of papers 4.03 ASME Turbo Expo 2016: On generation of entropy waves by a premixed ﬂame Summary This paper is the numerical counterpart of the two previous publications. Here, it has been proved numerically that the ﬁxed ﬂame front model is not suitable for predicting entropy waves generation. The results from fully compressible CFD simulations show that only neg- ligible temperature inhomogeneities are produced downstream a perfectly premixed ﬂame. It follows that the formulation given in previous work in literature are misleading, since they predicted leading order entropy generation even for perfectly homogeneous premixture. Indeed, leading order entropy waves are produced downstream a premixed ﬂame, only when equivalence ratio changes upstream. Following the analytical results in, the entropy waves s′ 2/cp in presence of φ′ have been evaluated numerically. The order of magnitude entropy waves evaluated at the outlet of the computational domain validates the analytical predictions. However, for an accurate prediction of the low-frequency limit of the entropy transfer function (Eφ(ω) = (s′ 2/cp )/(φ′/ ¯φ)), it is necessary to account for the thermophysical properties of real gases before and after combustion. Contribution I conceived the outline of this paper together with T. Steinbacher, Prof. W. Polifke and Dr. C. Silva. I performed the compressible simulations in A VBP of the adiabatic ﬂame, and carried out the post-processing of the unsteady time series and the identiﬁcation of the entropy transfer function. Reference Lin Strobio Chen, Thomas Steinbacher, Camilo Silva, Wolfgang Polifke, \"On generation of entropy waves by a premixed ﬂame\", ASME Turbo Expo, Seoul, South Korea, 13–17 June 2016 Erratum Fig. 7 in the paper contains a scaling error: the low-frequency limit of the entropy transfer function gain |E|φ(ω) is lower than the prediction given by Eq. (25). The correct values are given below, in Fig 4.01, even if the general conclusions do not change: the low-pass ﬁlter behavior is conserved. The difference in the low-frequency limit value is due to the variation in speciﬁc heat at constant pressure with temperature, which should not be neglected. This can be also evinced from Fig. 4.02 (Fig. 8 in the paper), in which the magnitude of entropy waves evaluated at the outlet from CFD is about 3/4 the prediction given by Eq. (10). The correct graphic is as follows: 4.03 ASME Turbo Expo 2016: On generation of entropy waves by a premixed ﬂame Figure 4.01: Entropy transfer function E|φ.

The objective of the study is to identify the frequency response of the heat transfer rate with respect to perturbations of ﬂow velocity, and the acoustic scattering matrix of the heat exchanger. Compressible and weakly compressible simulations have been carried out for the identiﬁcation of the heat exchanger transfer function (HXTF (ω) = ( ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q)/(u′ 1/ ¯u 1)) in a real-life non-compact heat exchanger. Good agreement is found between the weakly and the fully compressible simulation results. Considerations on the relation between unsteady heat transfer rate and entropy production in heat exchangers (ﬁxed heat sources) at low frequencies have been carried out. In order to ﬁnd the role of the geometry and the unsteady heat transfer rate on the acoustic scat- tering, he authors developed a Grey-box model of the heat exchanger scattering matrix, com- bining the geometric properties of the tube array and the HXTF. Good qualitative agreement is found in the comparison with scattering matrix identiﬁed from fully compressible simulations. However, some discrepancies are found at low frequencies. Contribution I conceived the outline of this paper together with A. Witte and Prof. Polifke. I performed the compressible simulations in Open FOAM of the heat exchanger, the post-processing of the unsteady acoustic signals and implemented the network model of the system.

Analysis shows that the heat exchanger scattering proper- ties can have a signiﬁcant impact on the total system acoustic scattering properties, especially in presence of resonance peaks due to the ﬂame intrinsic feedback. Such inﬂuence may not be readily apparent. However, results in the paper show that, close to resonance peaks, the total scattering behavior can be very sensitive to small changes in the reﬂection properties of the heat exchanger. The study has also focused on the validity of the network approach at varying distance between ﬂame and heat exchanger. As pointed out in the section 2.02.04, the acoustic network approach is valid, provided that the elements in the network interact only acoustically and no changes in the mean ﬂow ﬁeld occurs. It has been found that, in the case analyzed, such limit occurs at a distance of about 10 mm between the ﬂame holder and the cylinder. At 10 mm the mean ﬂow ﬁeld is changed with respect to the segregated case, since the velocity proﬁle upstream the heat exchanger is not uniform, but is inﬂuenced by the ﬂame ﬂow ﬁeld.

I personally performed the compressible simulations in A VBP of ﬂame, heat exchanger and the joint system, the network model of the systems and the post-processing in Matlab.

Summary of papers 5 Conclusions 5.01 Analytic modeling of jump conditions across moving and ﬁxed heat sources In the ﬁrst analytical studies, the differences between ﬂames and heat exchangers have been explored. The analysis has shown that, up to ﬁrst order in Mach number, the difference in analytic modeling between a moving heat source (premixed ﬂame) and a heat source at rest (heat exchanger) lies primarily in the prediction of entropy production and the correct formulation for the linearized continuity equation for acoustic perturbations. With the analytical model used in the publications [54–56], it was possible to identify the dom- inant source for entropy wave generation in premixed ﬂames, which consists in ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio upstream of the ﬂame. It was also possible to explain the origin of ﬁrst order entropy waves produced downstream a perfectly premixed ﬂame, which originate from the in- teraction between the upstream acoustics and themean heat release rate at the ﬂame. The model presented and discussed in this work also allows to explain and solve the paradox mentioned by Bauerheim in for conservation of acoustic mass ﬂow rate at zero Mach.

No direct relation can be established between the unsteady heat release rate (per unit of volume) and entropy waves production. Conclusions The analytical works have also clariﬁed the interdependency between the unsteady heat release rate ˙Q′ (i.e. ﬂame transfer function) and entropy wave generation (see Fig. 5.01). Is has been proved that entropy wave generation does not univoquely relate to the unsteady heat release rate at the ﬂame front. On the other hand, heat sources at rest cannot adapt to the incoming ﬂow perturbations, as it happens in premixed ﬂames. Therefore, an increase in incoming mass ﬂow always generates downstream temperature ﬂuctuations. This also happens at the low-frequency limit, since the HXTF of real heat exchangers never equal unity, unless the heat exchanger has inﬁnite surface. 5.02 Inﬂuence of a cold heat exchanger on the scattering be- havior of the thermoacoustic system System featuring ﬁxed heat sources such as cold heat exchangers may produce more entropy waves downstream. In addition to this, analyses in have shown that the presence of a cold heat exchanger may strongly impact on the acoustic scattering behavior (therefore, on the stability) of a thermoacoustic system, when placed downstream a ﬂame or an active heat source. Even nearly acoustically transparent elements (i.e. low reﬂection coefﬁcients, transmis- sion coefﬁcients close to unity) can greatly enhance the acoustic ampliﬁcation of the system. For the test case analyzed in we quantiﬁed the impact of the heat exchanger on the ther- moacoustic stability. Stability maps obtained for the network models pictured in Figs. 5.02 - 5.03 suggest that, for the conﬁguration explored in, in presence of a weak reﬂection coefﬁcient at the boundaries, the presence of a single tube row enhances system instability (The blue area, which indicates stability, is reduced in Fig. 5.03). To explore the effect of multiple tube bundles downstream the heat source, a third network model is created, with a ﬁctitious heat exchanger tube row, which has the same acoustic scattering property as the ﬁrst tube bundle, and the same temperature ratio between upstream and downstream. The destabilizing effect is enhanced in this third case. The eigenfrequencies ( fei g 1 = 260 Hz, fei g 2 = 255 Hz, fei g 3 = 230 Hz) decrease when multiple heat exchangers are placed downstream the ﬂame, since the temperature of the downstream ﬂow (and the speed of sound ) are lower. 5.02 Inﬂuence of a cold heat exchanger on the scattering behavior of the thermoacoustic system Figure 5.02: Stability map of a system featuring a ducted premixed ﬂame as in.

Conclusions 6 Outlook In the present work, we focused on the acoustic scattering and entropy generation across moving premixed ﬂames and ﬁxed heat sources, such as heat exchangers. It has been found that moving sources and sources at rest have different entropy generation mechanisms. Compared to pre- mixed ﬂames, heat exchangers are more prone to generation of temperature inhomogeneities. From a network model perspective, such inhomogeneities should be taken into account, not only downstream of heat exchangers, but also close to the so-called \"secondary entropy sources\", such as non-adiabatic walls, cold ﬂow injection (see temperature inhomogeneities due to cold ﬂow injection in the afterburner in Fig. 6.01), cooled turbine blades or acoustic dampers. Close to these parts, the temperature ﬁeld has a 2-D or 3-D distribution, which should be accounted for in the propagation of acoustic waves. As shown in the conclusions (Sec. 5), the presence of heat exchanger tube bundles greatly inﬂuences the system stability. The effect of the cooling element cannot be determined a pri- ori. Instead, it depends on the geometry (area blockage), temperature jump and unsteady heat transfer rate. In real systems, several tube bundles are found downstream of the ﬂame, in or- der to optimize the heat exchange and the environmental restrictions on emissions temperature. A more detailed study should be carried out, in order to extend the thermoacoustic stability analysis to more complex geometries.

Upstream perturbations u′ 1, p′ 1,ρ′ 1 are ampliﬁed across the discontinuity. Downstream perturbations u′ 2, p′ 2,ρ′ 2 are related to the oscillations upstream and to the unsteady heat re- lease rate ˙Q′. In the case of a moving heat source, the relative velocity of the ﬂame front with respect to the ﬁxed observer is given byus (t). In linear regime, the ﬂame oscillates around the mean ﬂame position ¯x f. For a heat source at rest, the velocity of the heat source in the laboratory frame is zerous (t) = 0, thus the location of the source, ¯x f, is constant in time. 4 2.01 Simple thermoacoustic system featuring a plane ﬂame in a duct with open ends. 9 2.02 Corresponding network modeling of the system in Fig. 2.01.

These equations relate the down- stream ﬂuctuations of pressure and velocity to upstream perturbations and ﬂuctuations of the heat release. However, if the heat source considered is a moving premixed ﬂame, the Rankine- Hugoniot equations can give seemingly contradictory results. The overall objective of this pa- per is to shed light on the apparent inconsistencies which may arise from the Rankine-Hugoniot relations in the case of moving premixed ﬂames, by analyzing the inﬂuence of the ﬂame front movement with respect to acoustic and entropy waves propagation across the discontinuity. In addition, two limit-cases are examined: the ﬁrst case consists in a ﬂuctuating ﬂame front, which is purely convected by upstream velocity ﬂuctuations; the latter is a perfectly ﬁxed ﬂame front. Finally, accounting for the two limit cases, the validity of the Rankine-Hugoniot equations is discussed. 1. Introduction The modeling of acoustic scattering properties of a heat source is a fundamental step in the study of every thermoacoustic system. The interaction between a thin ﬂame front and acoustic distur- bances was ﬁrst analyzed by Chu. In his analysis, Chu not only tried to analytically quantify the ampliﬁcation of acoustic disturbances across the ﬂame, but also gave insight on the relation between the ﬂame front movement and acoustics. In the linear regime, the Rankine-Hugoniot relations are a widely employed analytical model to assess results from simulations and experiments. These equations are derived from the linearized conservation equations for ﬂuctuating mass, momentum and energy across the heat source. However, the Rankine-Hugoniot relations do not take explicitly into account any information concerning the unsteady position of the heat source. The objective of this paper is to investigate the inﬂuence of the dynamics of the heat source on the overall system acoustics, and to assess the validity of the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. For this purpose, a set of equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy across a temperature discontinuity is derived (Section 3); then, the inﬂuence of the heat source movement is analyzed with respect to entropy and acoustic waves (Section 4); next, a model for a quasi 1- dimensional premixed ﬂame is taken into account as source term (Section 5); ﬁnally, with reference to the case of premixed ﬂame, the case of a ﬂuctuating ﬂame front is compared against the case of a ﬁxed ﬂame front (Section 6).

Apparent contradictions in Rankine-Hugoniot relations The Rankine-Hugoniot relations consist of a system of two equations (see derivation in ): u′ 2 = u′ 1 + ¯u 1 (¯T 2 ¯T 1 −1 )( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q −p′ ¯p 1 ) + O(M 2) (1) p′ 2 = p′ 1 + O(M 2) (2) The subscript ’1’ denotes variables upstream and ’2’ denotes quantities downstream the heat source. The downstream acoustic quantities are related to the upstream ﬂuctuations through mean ﬂow quanti- ties ( ¯T 1, ¯T 2,¯u 1) and heat release ﬂuctuations ( ˙Q′). Now, considering the case in which the heat release of the source is constant ( ˙Q′ = 0), and pointing out the fact that the pressure ﬂuctuations ( p′ 1/¯p 1) are negligible with respect to velocity ﬂuctuations, the system reduces simply to: u′ 2 = u′ 1 (3) p′ 2 = p′ 1 (4) This solution seems to contradict the ﬂuctuating mass conservation equation: ρ′ ρ2 + u′ u 2 = ρ′ ρ1 + u′ u 1, (5) which suggests that downstream velocity ﬂuctuations should be higher than upstream 1, as a result of the temperature and density discontinuity. However, the result u′ 1 = u′ 2 suggests that the discontinuity is being ’convected’ by the upstream velocity ﬂuctuations u′ 1. In fact, the ﬂuid particle, which is accelerated by the ﬂuctuations in upstream velocity, cannot penetrate the discontinuity, in case the latter is accelerated to the same extent, as an effect of u′ 1. Therefore, the velocity ﬂuctuation u′ 1 associated to the ﬂow particle cannot undergo any ampliﬁcation, and the discontinuity can be regarded as an impermeable moving membrane between the cold mixture and the hot burnt gases. In view of these considerations, a formalism which ac- counts for the movement of the heat source is needed, so as to assess the inﬂuence of the heat source movement on the system acoustics. 3. Conservation equations across a moving heat source 3.01 Derivation The Rankine-Hugoniot equations in thermoacoustics are essentially conservation equations ex- pressed in integral form. The relations describe discontinuities over inﬁnitesimally thin surfaces, such as ﬂame fronts or shock waves, for which the integration volume tends to zero. Across a shock wave propagating with velocity us, the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditionfor an arbitrary ﬂux function f(φ) is expressed as : us (φ2 −φ1) = f(φ)2 −f(φ)1, (6) In 1-D thermoacoustic systems, the governing equations for acoustics are the non-homogeneous Euler equations, in which viscous effects and gravity are neglected: ∂φ ∂t + ∂f(φ) ∂x = S, (7) where φ, f(φ) and the source term vector Sare of the form: 1 the density ﬂuctuations are negligible with respect to the velocity ﬂuctuations ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 2 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 φ=   ρ ρu ρE   f(φ) =   ρu ρu 2 + p u(E+ p)   S=   ˙q  . (8) The non-homogeneity is determined by the presence of the heat source in the energy equation. For an ideal gas, the total speciﬁc energy and enthalpy of the ﬂuid are expressed as: E = e+ 1 2 u 2, (9) H = h+ 1 2 u 2 = E+ p ρ, (10) e= cv T = p (γ−1)ρ, (11) where γ = cp/cv. Applying the jump condition (6) to the Euler equations (7), the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy are given as follows: us(ρ2 −ρ1) = ρ2 u 2 −ρ1 u 1, (12) us(ρ2 u 2 −ρ1 u 1) = ρ2 u 2 2 −ρ1 u 2 1 + p 2 −p 1, (13) us(ρ2 E 2 −ρ1 E 1) = ρ2 u 2 H 2 −ρ1 u 1 H 1 − ˙Q, (14) where ˙Q= ∫2 1 ˙qdx. Considering the eqs. (9), the energy and enthalpy of the ﬂow can be rewritten in terms of u, pand ρ. In addition, under the hypothesis of constant speciﬁc heats, cp 1 = cp 2, cv 1 = cv 2 the energy equation reduces to: us ( p 2 γ−1 − p 1 γ−1 + 1 2ρ2 u 2 2 −1 2ρ1 u 2 ) = γ γ−1 u 2 p 2 − γ γ−1 u 1 p 1 + 1 2ρ2 u 3 2 −1 2ρ1 u 3 1 − ˙Q. (15) 3.02 Linearization Acoustics pertain to the small perturbations to a steady base ﬂow. Therefore, in order to focus on acoustic conservation equations, all variables (u,p,ρ,u s) are decomposed into a mean part, which is constant in time but spatially varying, and a ﬂuctuating component, which is varying both in time and space: u(x,t) = ¯u(x) + u′(x,t). (16) The decomposition for the heat source speed is: us(x,t) = 0 + u′ s(x,t). (17) In the lab reference frame, the heat source oscillates around a ﬁxed mean position. Thus, its mean velocity equals zero, while its oscillation is represented by u′ s. After linearization and retaining only ﬁrst order ﬂuctuating terms, the linear conservation equations for ﬂuctuating quantities are obtained. Since the ﬂow regimes of interest are all in low-Mach number range, only terms up to 1 st order in Mach number are retained in the derivation. Omitting algebraic manipulations, the equations reduce to: Mass: ρ′ 2 u 2 −ρ′ 1 u 1 + ρ2 u′ 2 −ρ1 u′ 1 = (ρ2 −ρ1)u′ s, (18) Momentum: p′ 2 = p′ 1, (19) ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 3 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 Energy: γ γ−1(p′ 2 u 2 −p′ 1 u 1 + p 2 u′ 2 −p 1 u′ 1) = ˙Q′. (20) The linearized equation of state for perfect gas was taken into account during the derivation: p′ = ρ′RT + ρRT′ (21) It is interesting to underline the fact that, by neglecting terms of higher order in Mach number, the momentum equation simply reduces to: ¯p 1 = ¯p 2 (see ) and upstream pressure ﬂuctuation can be considered equal to the pressure ﬂuctuation downstream. As a consequence of this, terms depend- ing on the heat source movement ( u′ s) vanish from the energy equation. Therefore, only the mass conservation equation is inﬂuenced by the movement of the heat source. 3.03 Normalized equations In order to simplify the analysis, the eqs. (18) to (20) are non-dimensionalized by mean ﬂow quantities. The normalized equations relate the upstream and downstream quantities only through λ= ¯T 2/¯T 1. Mass: ρ′ ¯ρ2 −ρ′ ¯ρ1 + u′ ¯u 2 −u′ ¯u 1 = u′ s ¯u 1 (1 λ −1 ) (22) Momentum: p′ ¯p 1 = p′ ¯p 2 (23) Energy: ˙Q′ ˙¯Q = p′ ¯p 1 + u′ ¯u 2 ( λ λ−1 ) −u′ ¯u 1 ( 1 λ−1 ) (24) The normalized conservation equations were derived considering the normalized equation of state for perfect gases: ρ′ ¯ρ2 + T′ ¯T 2 = ρ′ ¯ρ1 + T′ ¯T 1 (25) Equations (22) to (24) were ﬁrst derived by Chu and later by Schuermans. Both employed these equations in premixed ﬂame front modeling. However, the set of acoustic equations above can be used to describe any discontinuity in which heat transfer in involved. This is possible, provided that the extension of the heat source is much smaller than the acoustic wavelength (i.e. hypothesis of compactness is veriﬁed) and the heat release ﬂuctuation is expressed in the integral form ( ˙Q′), with a ’black-box’ approach. Here, this formalism will be used to address the apparent inconsistency expressed by eq. (3), by shedding light on the relation amongst acoustics, heat release ﬂuctuations and motion of the heat source. 4. Scattering and generation of acoustic and entropy waves The equations (22) - (24) are a system of 3 equations in 3 unknowns. These unknowns consist of: acoustic ﬂuctuations ( u′ 2/¯u 2,p′ 2/¯p 2) and ﬂuctuations of density ρ′ 2/¯ρ2. Since density ﬂuctuations are a function of both pressure and entropy oscillations, it is convenient to replace density with entropy ﬂuctuations: ρ′ ¯ρ = p′ γ¯p −s′ cp, (26) ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 4 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 so as to segregate the interplay between entropy and acoustic waves across the discontinuity. The solution of the system is:  u′ ¯u 2 p′ ¯p 2 s′ cp   =   λ (1 λ −1 ) 0 1 0(1 λ −1 ) (1 λ −1 )      M   u′ ¯u 1 p′ ¯p 1 s′ cp   +   ( 1 −1 λ ) 0( 1 −1 λ )      N · ˙Q′ ¯˙Q +   0( 1 −1 λ )      U ·u′ s ¯u 1 (27) A matrix form is used, in order to highlight the contribution of every variable to the overall ﬂow os- cillations. The matrix M contains the correlations between upstream and downstream acoustic and entropy oscillations; matrix N expresses the contribution of the heat release ﬂuctuations to the down- stream oscillations, while matrix U expresses the inﬂuence of the heat source movement. The terms M 11, M 12, M 21, M 22 represent the acoustic matrix, since they express the relation between upstream and downstream acoustic quantities exclusively. The terms M 31 and M 32 express the part of entropy ﬂuctuations related to acoustics. Terms M 13 and M 23, conversely, express the contribution of entropy oscillations to acoustics. However, the latter terms equal zero. Consequently, across a dis- continuity, acoustics waves propagation is independent of entropy waves, while entropy ﬂuctuations are strictly related to pressure and velocity oscillations. The term M 33 suggests that incoming entropy ﬂuctuations are merely convected through the discontinuity, without any ampliﬁcation. The derivation up to 1 st order in Mach number leads to the identity between upstream and down- stream mean and ﬂuctuating pressures. This is shown by the independence of pressure oscillations of both ˙Q′ and u′ s. On the other hand, the heat release ﬂuctuations inﬂuence the velocity and entropy ﬂuctuations to the same extent. Looking at vector U, there seems to be no inﬂuence of the heat source movement on the acoustics downstream. In fact, the velocity ﬂuctuations of the heat source seems to be inﬂuencing only the entropy ﬂuctuations downstream. However, before drawing conclusions on the overall inﬂuence of the heat source movement on the acoustics, it is necessary to solve the ’closure problem’, by relating the heat release ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ to upstream ﬂuctuations. 5. Quasi 1-D modeling of a perfectly premixed ﬂame In the present analysis, a ducted, perfectly premixed ﬂame will be taken into account as heat source (see ﬁg.1). The heat release per unit of ﬂame area for a premixed ﬂame is: ˙Q= Sf Af ρ1φq (28) where Sf is the mean ﬂame front speed, averaged on the ﬂame surface, Af (t) is the ﬂame area, q is the mass speciﬁc enthalpy of the fuel and φis the equivalence ratio of the mixture. Here, q and φare considered constant, since the ﬂame under analysis is perfectly premixed. In the steady case, the total mass ﬂow upstream equals the mass being burnt by the ﬂame front. At the ﬂame front, continuity imposes: u 1 Ad = Sf Af (29) where Ad is the area of the duct section. Whilst Ad is constant, the ﬂame area change as an effect of ﬂame stretching and wrinkling, contributing to the mass burning rate of the ﬂame front. In quasi 1-dimensional modeling, the effects of ﬂame area change ( A′ f ) and ﬂame speed ﬂuctuations( S′ f ) are taken into account in one variable: S′ FB, also called ’ﬂame brush’ speed. Given (28), the normalized heat release ﬂuctuations is expressed as: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = S′ f ¯Sf + A′ f ¯Af + ρ′ ¯ρ1 = S′ FB ¯SFB + ρ′ ¯ρ1 (30) ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 5 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 Figure 1.Quasi 1-D moving ﬂame front According to Chu, the ﬂame front movement with respect to the ﬁxed frame of reference is given by the so-called ’ﬂame condition’: u′ s ¯u 1 = u′ ¯u 1 −S′ FB ¯SFB (31) where ¯SFB = ¯u 1. Eq. (31) states that the movement of the ﬂame front in a premixed ﬂame is non- zero when the perturbations of u 1 and SFB are not equal. So, considering eq. (31) and (26), the heat release ﬂuctuation of a perfectly premixed ﬂame can be expressed as: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 −u′ s ¯u 1 + 1 γ p′ ¯p 1 −s′ cp (32) Replacing ˙Q′ ¯˙Q in eq. (33) with eq. (32), the resulting system matrix reduces to:   u′ ¯u 2 p′ ¯p 2 s′ cp   =   ( 1 −1 γ )(1 λ −1 ) 1 λ −1 0 1 0 ( 1 −1 γ )(1 λ −1 ) 1 λ      M   u′ ¯u 1 p′ ¯p 1 s′ cp   +   λ −1      U ·u′ s ¯u 1 (33) From the system matrix above, it clearly results that the ﬂame front movement inﬂuences the acoustics of the system (see vector U). However, the inﬂuence is indirect, because the effects of the ﬂame front movement impact on the system through the heat release ﬂuctuations. As a consequence of this, the heat release ﬂuctuations modeling becomes of crucial importance in characterizing the scattering properties of thermoacoustic systems, not only because it relates ˙Q′ to upstream perturbations, but also because it clariﬁes the relation between ˙Q′ and the motion of the heat source itself. 6. Analysis of limit cases In this section, two limit-cases are analyzed, in order to clarify the effects of the ﬂame front movement on velocity ﬂuctuations. The solutions for downstream pressure and entropy will not be evaluated, since in the case of a premixed ﬂame those quantities are not inﬂuenced by the ﬂame front movement. 6.01 Moving ﬂame front acoustics The ﬁrst limit case considers the hypothesis in which the ﬂame front movement equals the upstream velocity perturbations (u′ ¯u 1 = u′ s ¯u 1 ). According to eq. (32), the ﬂame model reduces to: ( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q ) moving = (1 γ p′ ¯p 1 ) − (s′ cp ) (34) ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 6 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 it follows from eq. (33) that the solution for downstream velocity ﬂuctuations is: u′ ¯u 2 = u′ ¯u 1 λ + p′ ¯p 1 ( 1 −1 γ )(1 λ −1 ) + s′ cp (1 λ −1 ) (35) The solution (35) shows that u′ ¯u 2 is inﬂuenced by both acoustic and entropy perturbations. However, for acoustic waves, the impact of p′ ¯p 1 is much smaller than the contribution of velocity perturbations. Some considerations on the order of magnitude yield : p′ ¯p = O ( γ ¯M )u′ ¯u p′ ¯p ∼O (ρ′ ¯ρ ) (36) For low-Mach number ﬂow regimes, the normalized pressure ﬂuctuations are much smaller than than the velocity ﬂuctuations. Moreover, considering the upstream ﬂow as isentropic ( s′ 1 = 0), the downstream velocity is expressed as: u′ 2 = u′ 1 (37) The result in eq. (37) can be explained by the fact that, in the case considered, the ﬂame front movement u′ s ¯u 1 counterbalances perfectly u′ ¯u 1, so that the ﬂame sheet is merely convected back and forth by the velocity perturbations. 6.02 Fixed ﬂame front acoustics The second limit-case deals with the hypothesis of a ﬁxed ﬂame front, i. e. u′ s = 0. According to eq. (32), the ﬂame model is in this case: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 + 1 γ p′ ¯p 1 −s′ cp (38) making the same considerations as in the previous case (eq. (36)), and considering the upstream ﬂow as isentropic, the ﬂame model reduces to: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 (39) which states that, for a ﬁxed perfectly premixed ﬂame, the normalized heat release ﬂuctuation is mainly a function of the upstream velocity perturbation. With reference to eq. (33), the solution for downstream velocity ﬂuctuations is: u′ 2 = u′ ¯T 2 ¯T 1 (40) This is the solution expected if the ’naive’ continuity equation were applied. In fact, the velocity ﬂuctuations downstream exceed those upstream as an effect of the temperature jump. For the ﬂame to be ﬁxed, according to eq. (31), the ﬂame brush speed should compensate the ﬂuctuations of upstream velocity. 7. Conclusions In the present work, some apparent contradictions arising from the Rankine-Hugoniot relations in the case of a moving heat source are considered. In order to address these inconsistencies, mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are derived for ﬂow disturbances across a moving dis- continuity. The results show a direct inﬂuence of the source movement on entropy waves downstream the discontinuity (see eq. (27)), and an indirect inﬂuence on acoustics, through heat release rate ˙Q′ ICSV 21, Beijing, China, July 13-17, 2014 7 21 st International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV 21), Beijing, China, 13-17 July 2014 (see eq. (32)). With reference to the quasi 1-D perfectly premixed ﬂame model, two limit cases are taken into account, so as to highlight the differences in downstream acoustics between a moving and a ﬁxed ﬂame, ceteris paribus. The comparison shows that velocity ﬂuctuations downstream are heavily inﬂuenced by the ﬂame front movement, and that apparently not reasonable results (as u′ 1 = u′ 2) can be explained by considering the unsteady position of the ﬂame front. Finally, by analyzing the solution in matrix (33), it is possible to state that the Rankine-Hugoniot rela- tions describe the acoustics across heat sources correctly, provided that the conservation equations are developed up to 1 st order in Mach number. In addition, both upstream perturbation and heat source dynamics have to be taken into account in the identiﬁcation of the heat release ﬂuctuations ˙Q′. 8.

This work shows how the model of a ﬂame at rest can misrepresent the generation of entropy waves, and how it leads to paradoxical results concerning the conservation of mass and vol- ume ﬂow rates across the ﬂame. Such inconsistencies can be resolved by taking into account the move- ment of the ﬂame in the coupling relations for ﬂow perturbations. Analysis in a quasi-1 D framework shows that in the absence of perturbations in equivalence ratio, the magnitude of the entropy waves generated across the ﬂame are ﬁrst order in Mach number and derive from interactions between the upstream acoustics and the mean heat release rate. For non-perfectly premixed ﬂames, ﬂuctuations in equivalence ratio may generate perturbations in entropy ofleading order in Mach number. Furthermore, for the moving ﬂame model conservation of volume ﬂow rate across a passive, perfectly premixed ﬂame appears as a natural consequence of mass and energy conservation. © 2016 The Combustion Institute.

Such insta- bilities may be caused by ﬂuctuations in pressure or velocity, i.e. acoustic disturbances, which impinge on the ﬂame, causing the heat release rate to become unsteady. Fluctuations in heat release rate will in turn generate more acoustic disturbances, so that a feedback-loop is established, which may result in self-excited in- stability. Acoustic perturbations at a ﬂame can also cause so-called “entropy waves”, i.e. temperature inhomogeneities in the burnt gases that are transported convectively. As Marble and Candel have explained, when such inhomogeneities experience accelera- tion downstream of the ﬂame (e.g. through a nozzle), acoustic waves are generated in both upstream and downstream directions from the zone of acceleration. The upstream propagating compo- nent travels back into the combustion chamber, contributing to the acoustic oscillations in the system. This mechanism can also trigger thermo-acoustic instabilities, see[2–5]. ∗ Corresponding author. Fax: +49 8928916218. E-mail address: strobio@tfd.mw.tum.de, linstrobiochen@gmail.com (L. Strobio Chen). According to Rayleigh,i n s t a b i l i t i e si nat h e r m o - a c o u s t i cs y s - tem can occur, when thermal and acoustic disturbances interact constructively. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of acous- tic and entropy waves generation across the ﬂame, and their prop- agation in the system is crucial for prediction and control of the thermo-acoustic instabilities. To predict system instabilities, the framework of low-order net- work models is widely employed [5,7–13].I nt h i sf r a m e w o r k,a one-dimensional thermo-acoustic system is represented as a net- work of acoustic elements, each one characterized by its transfer matrix, which expresses the relations between the ﬂow perturba- tions in velocityu′, pressure p′ and entropy s′ upstream of the el- ement to the perturbations downstream, see. In an idealized treatment, such relations may be derived ana- lytically from the linearized conservation equations for mass, mo- mentum and energy. The effect of a heat source on the acoustic ﬁeld may also be deduced from these conservation equations. In this case, the analysis should describe the scattering of acoustic waves by the temperature and density gradients that result from mean heat release rate ¯˙Q, as well as account for the coupling be- tween the ﬂuctuations of heat release ˙Q′ and the acoustic pertur- bations.1 1 Here and in the following, overbars ¯. denote mean values, while primed quan- tities. ′ refer to ﬂuctuations around the mean. http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2016.001.0015 0010-2180/© 2016 The Combustion Institute.

For a heat source at rest, the velocity of the heat source in the laboratory frameus (t) = 0, thus the location of the source,¯xf, is constant in time. The conﬁguration considered in the present paper is depicted in Fig. 1.T h eh e a ts o u r c ei sr e g a r d e da sao n e - d i m e n s i o n a l discontinuity. This is appropriate if the heat source iscompact,i. e. if both acoustic and entropy wavelengths are much larger than the axial extent of the heat source. Moreover, it is often assumed that the heat source isﬁxed at position ¯xf.Ad e r i v a t i o no ft h e r m o - acoustic coupling relations by analysis of the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy as they apply for a compact heat source at rest can be found in several prior studies, see e.g.[10,15– 17]. However, paradoxical conclusions may result from the thermo- acoustic coupling relations for a heat source at rest. The ﬁrst con- tradiction concerns the production of entropy waves by a heat source. The coupling relations for a heat source at rest imply that in general unsteady heat release˙Q′ ̸= 0 should result in the gener- ation of entropy waves, i.e.s′ ̸= 0 d o w n s t r e a mo ft h eh e a ts o u r c e, see.H o w e v e r,i nt h ec a s eo fap e r f e c t l yp r e m i x e dﬂ a m e with homogeneous fuel/air premixture, the presence of signiﬁcant entropy waves (i.e. temperature inhomogeneities) downstream of the combustion zone is diﬃcult to justify physically, because in the case of adiabatic and complete combustion, the temperature in- crease across the ﬂame and thus also the temperature downstream of the ﬂame should be constant. The second issue has been raised by Bauerheim et al for the case of a passive ﬂame (˙Q′ = 0) at rest, in the limit of vanishing mean ﬂow Mach number. In the absence of mean ﬂow, the energy conservation equation is reduced to conservation of volume ﬂux, which implies that ﬂuctuations of upstream (“1”) and downstream (“2”) velocities be equal,u′ 1 = u′ 2.H o w e v e r,t h i si si na p p a r e n tc o n - tradiction with mass conservation, which for M = 0 w o u l ds e e mt o impose u′ 1 ¯ρ1 = u′ 2 ¯ρ2.B a u e r h e i me ta l. reexamined the quasi- 1 D conservation equations and observed that acoustic and entropy perturbations are coupled. At zero Mach number, a singularity in entropy is produced, which acts as an additional source term in the mass balance equation, which “explains why mass conserva- tion of ﬂuctuations is satisﬁed at non-zero Mach number while volume ﬂow rate is conserved at zero Mach number”.T h u s the paradox is resolved, but the conclusions that result from the mathematical arguments are not easily reconciled with physical in- tuition. For the two cases mentioned above, conclusions developed from linearized conservation equations for mass and energy are either apparently contradictory, or non-intuitive. This is rather un- satisfactory, since mathematical models should represent and clar- ify the actual physical problem. The physical meaning of the inter- dependency among entropy waves generation, unsteady heat re- lease and mass ﬂow conservation needs to be re-examined and contextualized by revisiting the coupling relations and the under- lying assumptions. In this work, it will be shown how the issues described can be resolved by relaxing the assumption that the heat source is at rest. Instead, the ﬂame front will be considered as a moving disconti- nuity, which implies that movement of the heat source must be taken into account in the conservation equations. Equations which describe the propagation of small ﬂow disturbances across a mov- ing heat source were ﬁrst derived by Chu.A l t h o u g ht h e moving ﬂame model has been used since in many studies, see e.g. [7,12,22–29],i t sc o n s e q u e n c e so na c o u s t i cs c a t t e r i n ga n dg e n e r a - tion of entropy wave have not been fully explored. The present pa- per will analyze these consequences, by verifying the validity of the equations with physical arguments and examples. In Section 2, we will introduce the difference between a mov- ing heat source and a heat source at rest and explicate some consequences of movement of the heat source. In particular, the linearized conservation equations for perturbations of velocity, pressure and entropy across a moving heat source are analyzed (Section 3). Section 4 turns to the particular case of a moving pre- mixed ﬂame front, with ﬂuctuations in heat release rate, ﬂame speed and ﬂame surface area in response to upstream velocity per- turbations. Next, the consequences of the ﬂame front movement on entropy generation and acoustic scattering are examined for both perfectly and non-perfectly premixed ﬂame (Sections 5 and 6). Finally, after terminology is established and the main results of this study are presented,Section 7 discusses and contextualizes previous publications on the model of a moving ﬂame[7,12,22–29] and a ﬂame at rest[10,15–17,30–32],r e s p e c t i v e l y. 2. Motivation In this section, we state the problems discussed in the previous section in mathematical terms and discuss some of the limitations that are implied with the application of the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy to a heat source at rest. For the sake of simplicity, the case of a “passive source”, i.e. a heat source without ﬂuctuations of the heat release rate, ˙Q′ = 0, will be con- sidered. In presence of perturbations, relevant variables are divided into a mean component, which varies spatially, and a ﬂuctuating com- ponent, which in general is a function of both time and space: ϕ(x, t) = ¯ϕ(x) + ϕ′(x, t). (1) For analysis of the perturbations across a compact heat source, ac o m m o n l ya d o p t e da p p r o a c hi st oc o n s i d e rt h el i n e a r i z e dc o n - servation equations just upstream and downstream of a disconti- nuity. The equations for conservation of mass, momentum and en- ergy read (cf.[5,10,15–17,32,33]): [ρ′ ¯u + u′ ¯ρ]2 1 = 0, [p′ + ρ′ ¯u 2 + 2¯ρ ¯uu′]2 1 = 0, [cp ¯T (ρ′ ¯u + u′ ¯ρ) + ¯ρ ¯u(cp T′ + ¯uu′)]2 1 = ˙Q′. (2) Angular brackets [ϕ]2 1 with sub-/super-scripts denote the dif- ference between values of a ﬂow variable ϕ upstream (“1”) and downstream (“2”) of the jump, i.e. [ϕ]2 1 = ϕ2 − ϕ1. As mentioned in the previous section, the source region is considered as inﬁnitesi- mally thin (i.e. compact with respect to acoustic and, in presence of mean ﬂow, to entropy waves)a n dﬁ x e da tp o s i t i o n¯xf in the stream-wise direction (see Fig. 1). The discontinuity is regarded as a “black-box’’, and its dynamic response to upstream perturbations is only represented by the source term˙Q′. In order to simplify the analysis, the ﬂuctuating terms may be normalized by their respective mean values. Additionally, since ﬂow regimes of interest are typically characterized by M ≪ 1, terms of second or higher order in Mach number may be Please cite this article as: L.

Strobio Chen et al / Combustion and Flame 000 1–11 3 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID: CNF [m 5 G;February 10, 2016;18:7] neglected. Therefore, Eqs. (2) reduce to : ρ′ ¯ρ2 + u′ ¯u 2 = ρ′ ¯ρ1 + u′ ¯u 1, p′ ¯p 2 = p′ ¯p 1 + O(M 2 ), u′ ¯u 2 ( ¯T 2 ¯T 2 − ¯T 1 ) = ˙Q′ ¯˙Q + u′ ¯u 1 ( ¯T 1 ¯T 2 − ¯T 1 ) − p′ ¯p 1 + O(M 2 ). (3) Considering the simplest case of a passive heat source (˙Q′ = 0) and recalling the relation between entropy waves and ﬂuctuations in pressure and density: s′ cp = p′ γ ¯p − ρ′ ¯ρ, (4) Eqs. (3) give for the entropy waves produced downstream: s′ cp = ( ¯T 1 ¯T 2 − 1 )( u′ ¯u 1 + p′ ¯p 1 ) + s′ cp + O(M 2 ). (5) Now, assuming that the upstream ﬂow is isentropics′ 1 = 0, and considering that for linear perturbations and small Mach numbers pressure ﬂuctuations are negligible compared to velocity ﬂuctua- tions, p′ ¯p 1 = O(γ M) u′ ¯u 1 ≪ u′ ¯u 1, (6) it is reasonable to state that entropy production across the passive source is mainly due to the velocity perturbations: s′ cp ≈ ( ¯T 1 ¯T 2 − 1 ) u′ ¯u 1. (7) Such dependency is easily explained for a compact heater. In fact, in presence of constant total heat transfer rate (˙Q = ˙mcp/Delta 1 T = const), as the mass ﬂow rate through the heater changes, the spe- ciﬁc enthalpy jump will also change, generating temperature ﬂuc- tuations. This is conﬁrmed by Eq. (7), which shows that in re- sponse to a positive ﬂuctuation in velocityu′ 1 (i.e. to an increase in mass ﬂow), a drop in downstream speciﬁc entropys′ 2 must take place. However, for the case of aperfectly premixed ﬂame, where the equivalence ratio is constant and cannot be affected by ﬂow per- turbations, the dependency expressed in Eq. (7) seems unphysical. In fact, in this case, the speciﬁc enthalpy jump is constant by deﬁ- nition and does not depend on the changes in mass ﬂow rate. Why do the coupling relations in Eqs. (2) and (3) fail to rep- resent the physics of a perfectly premixed ﬂame? The answer was given by Chu (see), who pointed out that, acoustically speak- ing, the “chief difference between a ﬂame and a heater” lies in the fact that the ﬂame front has a dynamic behavior and can move from its mean position in response to upstream perturba- tions. Such movement, however, is not known a priori and is re- lated to the local ﬂame speed, “whereas for a heater, such move- ment is assumed to be given”. Indeed, the ﬂame is not a ﬁxed discontinuity, but can move, wrinkle or stretch in response to velocity perturbations. The pres- ence of a moving discontinuity, instead of one at rest, impacts di- rectly on the acoustic scattering and entropy generation across the heat source. In fact, in presence of a moving discontinuity, the instantaneous mass ﬂow crossing the ﬂame front does no longer depend exclu- sively on the incoming ﬂow conditions (ρ1, u 1), but also on the un- steady movement of the ﬂame front itself. Considering a quasi-1 D conﬁguration – see Fig. 1 –t h ei n s t a n t a n e o u sm a s sﬂ o wc r o s s i n g the discontinuity becomes: ˙m(t) = (u 1(t) − us(t))ρ1(t), (8) where us(t)i st h ev e l o c i t yo ft h eﬂ a m ef r o n ti nt h el a b o r a t o r y frame of reference, determined by kinematic balance between ﬂame propagation and convection. This balance may be disturbed by ﬂow perturbations, resulting in u′ s(t) ̸= 0. Eq. (8) shows that, depending on the response of the ﬂame to acoustics in terms of us(t), very different results for the mass conservation equation may be obtained. Furthermore, mass-speciﬁc entropy s is – just like temperature T –a ni n t e n s i v eq u a n t i t y,r e l a t e dt ot h et o t a lh e a tr e l e a s e˙Q(t) through the mass consumption at the ﬂame front. Therefore, en- tropy and temperature ﬂuctuations downstream of the ﬂame can be correctly predicted if and only if the ﬂuctuations in mass con- sumption are also quantiﬁed correctly. The second issue mentioned in the introduction concerns the speciﬁc case of combustion in the limiting case of zero Mach num- ber.I na b s e n c eo fm e a nﬂ o w,M = 0, Eqs. (2) for a passive ﬂame ˙Q′ = 0 a r es i m p l i ﬁ e dt o : ¯ρ1 u′ 1 = ¯ρ2 u′ 2, (9) p′ 1 = p′ 2, (10) ¯T 1 ¯ρ1 u′ 1 = ¯T 2 ¯ρ2 u′ 2. (11) At zero Mach, the combustion is perfectly isobaric, p 1 = p 2. With the ideal gas law,ρ1 T 1 = ρ2 T 2. It follows that the energy con- servation Eq. (11)is reduced to u′ 1 = u′ 2, (12) which may be interpreted as conservation of volume ﬂow rate (per duct cross-sectional area) across the ﬂame. The validity of volume ﬂow rate conservation at zero Mach is in agreement with the results of many thermoacoustic studies. It can be easily veriﬁed with the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot equations (see ): u′ 2 = u′ 1 + ¯u 1 ( ¯T 2 ¯T 1 − 1 )( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q − p′ ¯p 1 ) + O(M 2 ), (13) p′ 2 = p′ 1 + O(M 2 ). With reference to Eq. (13), in absence of mean ﬂow, the upstream and downstream velocity perturbations coincide; thus agreement with Eq. (12) is established. However, the result in Eq. (12) does not agree with the mass conservation expressed by Eq. (9),w h i c hi m p l i e st h a tt h ev e l o c i t y ﬂuctuations are ampliﬁed across the ﬂame front as an effect of the temperature jump. Bauerheim et al proved the consistency of volume ﬂow conservation at M = 0 with mass ﬂow conservation at M ̸= 0. In their analysis, the entropy wave source terms were crucial to the solution of the problem. However, as mentioned pre- viously, the generation of entropy waves downstream a premixed ﬂame front should be a function of the enthalpy of the premix- ture, and, in principle, independent from mass ﬂow conservation. Is there a solution to the inconsistency between volume and mass ﬂow at M = 0, which does not depend on entropy generation, in the speciﬁc case of a premixed ﬂame? Although the question of mass vs. volume ﬂow rate conserva- tion might seem to be completely unrelated to the problem of gen- eration of entropy waves, we argue that its resolution can be found in the ﬂame front movement as well. In fact,Eq. (9) expresses the continuity equation across a heat source at rest, while the shape and position of a ﬂame front are usually not ﬁxed, as mentioned Please cite this article as: L. Strobio Chen et al, Propagation and generation of acoustic and entropy waves across a moving ﬂame front, Combustion and Flame,http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2016.001.0015 4 L. Strobio Chen et al / Combustion and Flame 000 1–11 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID: CNF [m 5 G;February 10, 2016;18:7] previously (see Eq. (8)). Therefore, the mass conservation equation should be formulated for the case of amoving heat source. This for- mulation allows for the decoupling of entropy generation from the mass conservation equation, in the case of a moving ﬂame front. Moreover, we shall demonstrate (see Chapter 6) that the condi- tion expressed by Eq. (12) indeed implies for a passive ﬂame that the ﬂame front is moved back and forth by the velocity pertur- bations (see Fig. 1), such that the velocityu′ s of the discontinuity itself equals the ﬂuctuations in velocityu′ 1, which in turn equal the downstream ﬂuctuations u′ 2. The considerations presented for the two cases suggests that the ﬂame front movement should be taken into account when an- alyzing the coupling of acoustic waves across a ﬂame front and the generation of entropy waves by the ﬂame. The next section will re- view the formalism introduced by Chu to analyze the per- turbations across a moving premixed ﬂame front. The analysis is extended up to 1 st order in Mach. 3. Coupling relations for acoustics and entropy across a moving heat source 3.01. Derivation In gas dynamics, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions express the relation between the ﬂow variables upstream and downstream of an inﬁnitesimally thin discontinuity, typically a shock wave. Across a moving shock wave that is propagating with velocity us,t h e Rankine–Hugoniot conditions for the vectorϕ of ﬂow variables are expressed as (see): us(ϕ2 − ϕ1 ) = f (ϕ)2 − f (ϕ)1. (14) In a system of conservation equations associated to the vector ϕ, f(ϕ) is the vector of ﬂux functions of the conserved variables. In the present study the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions for a moving discontinuity will be applied to a plane, inﬁnitesimally thin heat source in one dimensional ﬂow, see Fig. 1. For the moment, we make no further assumptions on the nature of the heat source. The application that we have in mind is, of course, a compact premixed ﬂame in a quasi-1 D ﬂow conﬁguration. Pertinent con- sequences for the acoustic/entropy coupling relations will be ex- plored in the next section. The relevant governing equations are the non-homogeneous Eu- ler equations: ∂ϕ ∂t + ∂ f (ϕ) ∂x = S, (15) where ϕ, f(ϕ) and the source term S are of the form: ϕ = ⎛ ⎝ ρ ρu ρE ⎞ ⎠, f (ϕ) = ⎛ ⎝ ρu ρu 2 + p u(E + p) ⎞ ⎠, S = ⎛ ⎝ ˙q ⎞ ⎠. (16) The conserved ﬂow variables are mass, momentum and energy, while the inhomogeneity of the equations is due to the heat source term in the energy equation. Applying the jump condition in Eq. (14) to the variables in Eq. (16), the conservation equations across a moving heat source (ﬁrst presented by Chu)r e a d : ρ2 u 2 − ρ1 u 1 = us(ρ2 − ρ1 ), (17) ρ2 u 2 2 − ρ1 u 2 1 + p 2 − p 1 = us(ρ2 u 2 − ρ1 u 1 ), (18) ρ2 u 2 H 2 − ρ1 u 1 H 1 − ˙Q = us(ρ2 E 2 − ρ1 E 1 ), (19) As already mentioned,us(t) is the velocity of the heat source in the laboratory frame of reference. As an extension of the original formulation in,w h i c hi sf r e q u e n t l yu s e di ng a sd y n a m i c s,h e r e we have included a source term in the energy equation,˙Q, which is the total heat release rate per cross-sectional area,˙Q = ∫ ¯x+ f ¯x− f ˙qd x. Recalling the relations between the total energy E and total en- thalpy H for an ideal gas: H = h + 1 2 |u|2 = e + p ρ + 1 2 |u|2 = E + p ρ, (20) ρe = p γ − 1, (21) and under the hypothesis of constant γ and cp,i ti sp o s s i b l et o reformulate the energy conservation Eq. (19) in terms of primitive variables ρ, u and p: γ γ − 1 (u 2 p 2 − u 1 p 1 ) + 1 (ρ2 u 3 2 − ρ1 u 3 ) − ˙Q = us ( γ − 1 (p 2 − p 1 ) + 1 (ρ2 u 2 2 − ρ1 u 2 )). (22) Assuming ﬂow in the low Mach regime, terms of second or higher order in Mach are neglected. This is appropriate for many combustion systems, as discussed below. The conservation equa- tions reduce to (see): [ρu]2 1 − us[ρ]2 1 = 0, (23) [p]2 1 = O(M 2 ), (24) γ γ − 1 [up]2 1 = ˙Q + O(M 2 ). (25) 3.02. Linearized, non-dimensional conservation equations In the present analysis, we consider a thin planar heat source oscillating around a ﬁxed mean position¯xf, see Fig. 1.T h ed e c o m - position for us(t) is thus: us(t) = 0 + u′ s(t). (26) The equations for the mean quantities developed up to O(M 2 ) are: [ ¯ρ ¯u]2 1 = 0, (27) [ ¯p]2 1 = O(M 2 ), (28) γ γ − 1 [ ¯u ¯p]2 1 = ¯˙Q + O(M 2 ). (29) Subtracting Eqs. (27)–(29) from Eqs. (23)–(25),t h ec o n s e r v a t i o n equations for perturbation quantities are obtained. Retaining only the ﬂuctuations of ﬁrst order and normalizing by the correspond- ing mean quantities yields for mass: ρ′ ¯ρ2 − ρ′ ¯ρ1 + u′ ¯u 2 − u′ ¯u 1 = u′ s ¯u 1 ( 1 λ − 1 ), (30) momentum: p′ ¯p 1 = p′ ¯p 2 + O(M 2 ), (31) and energy: ˙Q′ ˙¯Q = p′ ¯p 1 + u′ ¯u 2 ( λ λ − 1 ) − u′ ¯u 1 ( 1 λ − 1 ) + O(M 2 ), (32) Please cite this article as: L.

By substituting the density ﬂuctuations it is possible to separate the acoustic scattering, i.e. the transmission and reﬂection of acoustic waves, from entropy generation. Omitting the algebraic manipulations and neglecting terms of 2 nd order and higher order in Mach number,Eqs. (30)–(32) are re-written in terms of acoustic and entropy perturbations as follows: ⎛ ⎜⎝ u′ ¯u 2 p′ ¯p 2 s′ cp ⎞ ⎟⎠ = ⎡ ⎢⎣ λ (1 λ − 1 ) 01 0(1 λ − 1 )( 1 λ − 1 ) ⎤ ⎥⎦    M ⎛ ⎜⎝ u′ ¯u 1 p′ ¯p 1 s′ cp ⎞ ⎟⎠ + ⎡ ⎢⎣ ( 1 − 1 λ ) 0( 1 − 1 λ ) ⎤ ⎥⎦    N ˙Q′ ¯˙Q + ⎡ ⎣ 0( 1 − 1 λ ) ⎤ ⎦    U u′ s ¯u 1 (34) The matrix M and the vectors N and U express the respective inﬂuence of upstream perturbations, ﬂuctuations of heat release rate and velocity of the heat source on the downstream pertur- bations. The terms M 11, M 12, M 21 and M 22 represent the acoustic trans- fer matrix, since they relate exclusively acoustic ﬂuctuationsp′, u′ at upstream and downstream positions to each other. The matrix coeﬃcients M 21 and M 22 show that the pressure does not exhibit a discontinuity at the heat source. This is a direct consequence of the low Mach number approximation, valid up to ﬁrst order in Mach number (M). The matrix coeﬃcients M 31 and M 32 will be non-zero if the mean heat release rate is non-zero, such that T 2 ̸= T 1 and thus λ ̸= 1. In this case, entropy is coupled to the acoustics, i.e. up- stream acoustic ﬂuctuations can generate downstream entropy waves. Conversely, the scattering of acoustic waves is independent from upstream entropy perturbations, as M 13 = M 23 = 0. The vector U shows that the immediate inﬂuence of heat source movement is restricted to the production of entropy waves. Such a results is very interesting, since it conﬁrms the idea expressed above (see Section 2)t h a tﬂ a m ef r o n tm o v e m e n tp l a y saf u n d a - mental role in the correct prediction of entropy generation across a premixed ﬂame. On the other hand, it appears that there is no direct inﬂuence of the velocity u′ s on the acoustic coupling relations (see U 1 and U 2). This suggests that the Rankine–Hugoniot relations(13) derived from the conservation equations for a generic heat source at rest (see e.g. )a r ea l s ov a l i df o rt h ec a s eo fam o v i n gh e a t source, at least for perturbations up to ﬁrst order in Mach num- ber. However, before drawing conclusions on theabsolute indepen- dence of the acoustic coupling relations from ﬂame front move- ment, it is necessary to take into account interdependencies be- tween ﬂuctuations of the rate of heat release and the velocity of a heat source that result from its physical nature. Such interdepen- dencies or constraints will be different for a heater, or a premixed ﬂame, or a non-premixed ﬂame, say, and need to be taken into ac- count when trying to achieve closure for the system of Eqs. (34) by relating the heat release ﬂuctuations to the upstream perturba- tions, ˙Q′ = ˙Q′(p′ 1, u′ 1, s′ 1 ). This will be done in the next section for the case of a premixed ﬂame in a quasi-1 D ﬂow conﬁguration. 4. Coupling relations for acoustics and entropy across a moving premixed ﬂame The thermoacoustic closure problem referred to at the end of the previous section is usually concerned with the quantiﬁcation of heat release ﬂuctuation ˙Q′ in response to acoustic perturbations. This may be achieved, e.g. by determining a ﬂame transfer func- tion [12,36–39].I nt h ep r e s e n tp a p e r,w ep u r s u ead i f f e r e n tg o a l and concentrate on the interdependencies between ﬂame speed, ﬂame movement, ﬂame surface area and heat release rate that result from the “physics” of the particular ﬂame conﬁguration at hand. This allows to describe and analyze the role of ﬂame move- ment in acoustic scattering and entropy generation at a premixed ﬂame. The analysis is carried out in a quasi-1 D framework. 4.01. Kinematic balance at a premixed ﬂame front For a ducted premixed ﬂame one may deﬁne a speciﬁc (per duct cross-sectional area, units m/s) rate of volume consumption, ˙V ≡ 1 Ad ∫ Af Sf d A = Sf Af Ad, (35) where Ad is the cross-sectional area of the duct, which is assumed constant, Sf the ﬂame speed and Af the ﬂame surface area. The second identity holds if the ﬂame speed Sf is constant along the surface of the ﬂame, which is assumed in the following without essential loss of generality. The following kinematic condition links the velocityu 1 of pre- mixture upstream of the ﬂame with the velocityus of the ﬂame in the laboratory frame and the volume consumption rate˙V: u 1(t) = ˙V (t) + us(t). (36) For an anchored ﬂame in steady state, kinematic balance be- tween ﬂow and ﬂame propagation implies (see also Fig. 1) ¯u 1 = ¯˙V, (37) with ¯us = 0. On the other hand, if the ﬂow is perturbed, the ﬂame will respond with changes in shape and position, such that u′ 1(t) = ˙V′(t) + u′ s(t). (38) Evidently, the volume consumption rate ˙V may be interpreted as an effective ﬂame speed,a k i nt ot h eﬂame brush speed in turbu- lent combustion modelling, which describes summarily the effect of ﬂame shape on the consumption rate of premixture: elongated or wrinkled ﬂames have a ﬂame surface area Af larger than the duct cross-sectional area Ad and thus consume more premixture than ﬂat ﬂames. 4.02. Heat release and volume consumption for a premixed ﬂame In a premixed ﬂame, heat release takes place when premixture is consumed at the ﬂame front. It follows that the heat release rate for a lean premixed ﬂame may be expressed in terms of the vol- ume consumption rate ˙V as follows: ˙Q = ρ1 ˙Vφ q, (39) Please cite this article as: L.

Strobio Chen et al / Combustion and Flame 000 1–11 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID: CNF [m 5 G;February 10, 2016;18:7] where ˙Q is the heat release rate per cross-sectional area of the duct (units W/m 2), φ the equivalence ratio of the premixture (which equals unity for stoichiometric conditions) andq the mass speciﬁc enthalpy of the premixture in stoichiometric conditions (units J/kg). For small perturbations, one formulates ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = ρ′ ¯ρ1 + ˙V′ ¯˙V + φ′ ¯φ. (40) Combining expression (40) with the kinematic conditions Eqs. (36), (38) and (4),w h i c hr e l a t e sp e r t u r b a t i o n si nd e n s i t yt ot h o s e of pressure and entropy, gives the following expression for the heat release ﬂuctuations of a premixed ﬂame: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 − u′ s ¯u 1 + φ′ ¯φ + 1 γ p′ ¯p 1 − s′ cp. (41) How to interpret this result? It is obviously not an alternative formulation of the energy balance Eq. (32) across a compact heat source, as it does not involve any downstream quantities (index “2”). Also, it should not be interpreted as a ﬂame transfer function. Premixed ﬂames respond predominantly to perturbations of up- stream ﬂow velocity, ˙Q′ ∼ Fu(u′), or equivalence ratio, ˙Q′ ∼ Fφ (φ′). The corresponding ﬂame transfer functions Fu and Fφ (see Huber and Polifke )d e p e n di nan o n - t r i v i a lm a n n e ro nd e t a i l e dﬂ o w - ﬂame interactions, which are not the subject of the present study. Instead, Eq. (41) should be regarded as an expression of interde- pendencies among ﬂow perturbations, ﬂame movement and rate of heat release. These constraints result from the physical effects that govern a lean, premixed ﬂame front, see Eqs. (36) and (39). In the previous section, we have presented a general expression of the coupling relations for mass, momentum and energy across a compact, moving heat source, i.e.Eq. (34).T h ec o r r e s p o n d i n gr e - lations for the speciﬁc case of a premixed ﬂame are obtained by substituting the result(41) for relative ﬂuctuations in heat release ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q in Eq. (34),r e s u l t i n gi n : ⎛ ⎜⎝ u′ ¯u 2 p′ ¯p 2 s′ cp ⎞ ⎟⎠ = ⎡ ⎢⎣ ( 1 − 1 γ )(1 λ − 1 ) 1 λ − 1 01 0 ( 1 − 1 γ )(1 λ − 1 ) 1 λ ⎤ ⎥⎦    M ⎛ ⎜⎝ u′ ¯u 1 p′ ¯p 1 s′ cp ⎞ ⎟⎠ + ⎡ ⎣ ( 1 − 1 λ ) 0( 1 − 1 λ ) ⎤ ⎦    F φ′ ¯φ + ⎡ ⎣ λ − 1 ⎤ ⎦    U u′ s ¯u 1 (42) Here we have chosen to represent the interactions in terms of three groups of key variables: upstream ﬂow perturbations u′ 1, p′ 1, s′ 1, equivalence ratio perturbationsφ′ and ﬂame movement u′ s. Note that upstream entropy ﬂuctuations are often negligible, s′ 1 → 0. Also, it was shown in Section 2 that the pressure term p′ 1/(γ ¯p 1 ) in Eq. (41) is of ﬁrst order in Mach number. On the other hand, as mentioned above, there is no a priori justiﬁcation for assuming that the order of magnitude of the ﬂame front move- ment u′ s is small, since it depends in a non-trivial manner on the response of the ﬂame to acoustic perturbations. Similarly, equiv- alence ratio perturbation are in general a leading order term in Eq. (41),a st h e yr e s u l tf r o mﬂ u c t u a t i o n si na i ra n df u e lﬂ o wr a t e s. It is worth noting that in the present quasi 1-D analysis we only consider ﬂuctuations in time and not in space, and that therefore fuel inhomogeneities in the normal direction are not ac- counted for. For the special case of a perfectly premixed ﬂame, where ﬂuc- tuations of equivalence ratio are absent, at low-Mach number and for isentropic upstream conditions,Eq. (41) reduces to: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 − u′ s ¯u 1 + O(M) (43) Correspondingly, the 2 nd term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (42) drops out and we see that in this case the downstream ﬂow perturba- tions (u′ 2, p′ 2, s′ 2)a r ed e t e r m i n e de n t i r e l yb yu p s t r e a mﬂ o wp e r t u r - bations (u′ 1, p′ 1, s′ 1)a n dﬂ a m em o v e m e n tu′ s. It should be noted that, even forφ′ = 0, the system described in Eq. (42) is still under-determined. In fact, the kinematic re- sponse of the ﬂame frontu′ s to upstream velocity perturbations is not known a priori. However, according to Eq. (43), such closure problem can be solved, with good approximation, by quantifying the heat release rate response to upstream perturbations in veloc- ity, i.e. by determining the ﬂame transfer function Fu of the perfectly premixed ﬂame. 4.03. Kinematic balance in time and frequency domains Re-writing the kinematic balance Eq. (38) as u′ s(t) = u′ 1(t) − ˙V′(t) (44) it becomes evident that the position of the ﬂame front is sub- ject two competing effects: on the one hand, perturbations in the oncoming ﬂow u′ 1 > 0 c o n v e c tt h eﬂ a m ef r o n td o w n s t r e a m.O n the other hand, perturbations in volume consumption rate˙V′ > 0 cause the ﬂame front to propagate in the upstream direction. This additional constraint was combined with Eq. (40) to de- rive Eq. (42) from (34) by elimination of the heat release ˙Q′.A l - ternatively, the equations may be written in terms of heat release ˙Q′ instead of ﬂame front velocity in the laboratory frameu′ s.F u n - damentally, both descriptions are equivalent – but in the present context, the formulation that makes explicit use of the ﬂame ve- locity u′ s is more convenient. Either way, the system of equations is not closed and a suitable closure model that relates either˙Q′ or u′ s to ﬂow perturbations is needed. Frequently, equations are transformed to the frequency domain and closure is achieved by relating the heat release ˙Q′ to up- stream velocity perturbationsu′ 1 via a ﬂame transfer function Fu(ω). If one formulates the governing equations withu′ s instead of ˙Q′, see Eq. (42), a “ﬂame velocity transfer function”Gu(ω)i sr e - quired, such that u′ s ¯u 1 = Gu(ω) u′ ¯u 1. (45) Such a velocity transfer function Gu(ω)a l l o w st od e v e l o pi n t e r - esting conclusions on the relation between heat release rate and the movement of a perfectly premixed ﬂame. Under the assump- tions made in the previous section, the expression for the heat re- lease rate Eq. (43) implies that Fu(ω) = 1 − Gu(ω). (46) Consequently, at the low frequency limit ω → 0, where the transfer function for the heat release rate Fu of a perfectly pre- mixed ﬂame approaches unity, Gu vanishes and the ﬂame front must remain at rest. Indeed, in this quasi-stationary limit any non-zero ﬂame front velocityu′ s ̸= 0 w o u l di m p l yﬂ a s hb a c ko re x - tinction. On the other hand, the typical low-pass character of premixed ﬂames causes the gain of |Fu|t ov a n i s ha th i g hf r e q u e n c i e s,i n d i - cating that the motion of the ﬂame front is dominated by rapid convective displacement by impinging velocity perturbations. The comparatively slow processes modulating the volume consump- tion rate, on the other hand, have negligible inﬂuence at high frequencies. Please cite this article as: L.

Strobio Chen et al / Combustion and Flame 000 1–11 7 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID: CNF [m 5 G;February 10, 2016;18:7] In the next two sections, we shall discuss further consequences of the interdependencies between ﬂow and ﬂame perturbations. In particular, the implications of Eqs. (41) and (43) for the generation of entropy waves and the scattering of acoustic waves at a pre- mixed ﬂame will be analyzed in detail. 5. Generation of entropy waves at a premixed ﬂame In the previous section, coupling relations for ﬂow perturba- tions across a compact, moving premixed ﬂame have been ob- tained. Consequences for the generation of entropy waves due to acoustic-ﬂame interactions will be discussed in the following. Both perfectly as well as non-perfectly premixed ﬂames will be consid- ered. The analysis concentrates on thegeneration of entropy waves, thus it will be assumed in the following that there are no pertur- bations of entropy upstream of the ﬂame (s′ 1 = 0). In the literature on low-order modeling of ﬂow-ﬂame interac- tions it has been stated repeatedly (see e.g.)t h a tt h el e a d - ing order term in downstream entropy ﬂuctuation is different from zero whenever the normalized ﬂuctuations in heat release rate do not equal the ﬂuctuations in upstream velocity: s′ cp ̸= 0 ⇔ ˙Q′ ¯˙Q ̸= u′ ¯u 1. (47) This result indeed is inevitable if the ﬂame is considered as a heat source at rest, its paradoxical consequences for the prediction of downstream entropy have been discussed in the Introduction. On the other hand, according to Eq. (42),w h i c hd e s c r i b e sa ﬂame that may change its position in response to ﬂow perturba- tions, downstream entropy perturbations evaluate to s′ cp = ( 1 − 1 λ ) φ′ ¯φ   O(1) + ( 1 − 1 γ ) ( 1 λ − 1 ) p′ ¯p 1    O(M) + s′ cp . (48) The last term on the r.h.s. is zero by assumption (see above). The second term, which results from an interaction of acoustic per- turbations with the mean temperature jump, is of ﬁrst order in Mach number. A detailed analysis of this mechanism of entropy wave generation is given in the Appendix of this paper. The only term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (48) that is not negligible at vanishing Mach number is the ﬁrst term, which describes the result of equiv- alence ratio ﬂuctuations. Eq. (48) may be written as follows: s′ 2 = cp ( 1 − Tc Th ) φ′ ¯φ + O(M). (49) The interpretation of this result, which was already developed by Keller and Polifke et al,i sr a t h e rs t r a i g h t f o r w a r d :i n h o - mogeneities in the fuel concentration of the premixture modulate the speciﬁc heat of combustion and thus result in ﬂuctuations of downstream temperature and density. For a perfectly premixed ﬂame φ′ = 0 a n ds′ 2 = O(M), i.e. lead- ing order entropy waves cannot be generated by this type of ﬂame. This does not imply – as Eq. (47) for a ﬂame at rest would suggest –t h a tﬂ u c t u a t i o n so fv e l o c i t yc a u s eap r o p o r t i o n a la n di m m e d i a t e perturbation of the heat release rate. Instead, referring to Eq. (40), we ﬁnd that for a perfectly premixed moving ﬂame ˙Q′ ˙Q = ˙V′ ˙V + O(M) (50) and conclude that ﬂuctuations in heat release rate vary according to the kinematic response of the ﬂame, which determines e.g. the shape and surface area of the ﬂame and thus its volume consump- tion rate. However, perturbations of this kind do not generate en- tropy waves, as they only modulate the rate at which premixture is consumed by the ﬂame, but they do not modulate the heat re- leased per unit mass of premixture and thus do not generate – to leading order – inhomogeneities of entropy. The analysis in this section has shown that for a premixed ﬂame, the generation of entropy waves is neither a direct nor a necessary consequence of unsteady heat release rate. Instead, en- tropy waves are generated to leading order in Mach number only from inhomogeneities in the equivalence ratio of the premixture. Additional entropy source terms, which are of ﬁrst order in Mach number, result from the interaction of acoustic ﬂuctuations with the mean heat release (see the Appendix A). The contradiction dis- cussed in the introduction of this paper is thereby resolved. The problem of the correct estimation of entropy waves is strictly connected to the correct formulation of mass ﬂow con- servation equation. Indeed, across a perfectly premixed ﬂame, no leading order temperature inhomogeneities can be produced, therefore ρ′ 2/ ¯ρ2 ∼ O(M). In the model of aﬂame at rest (Eqs. (3)), energy conservation gives for a passive source (˙Q′ = 0): u′ 1 = u′ 2 + O(M), while, in absence of leading order entropy, mass ﬂow con- servation gives: u′ 2 = ( ¯T 2/ ¯T 1 )u′ 1 + O(M).T h i sr e s u l ts h o w st h a ti n - consistencies indeed arise in the model of the ﬂame at rest, when entropy generation is taken into account. The next section, on the other hand, will show how themoving ﬂame model (u′ s ̸= 0) solves the inconsistency above at both zero and non-zero Mach number. 6. Coupling of velocity perturbations across a perfectly premixed ﬂame With reference to Eq. (42), we see that velocity perturbations downstream of a premixed ﬂame may result from several contri- butions: upstream acoustic and entropy perturbationsu′ 1, p′ 1, s′ 1, ﬂame movement u′ s and equivalence ratio ﬂuctuationsφ′.T h ei n - ﬂuences of φ′ and p′ 1 are easily explained: as discussed in the previous section, the ﬂuctuations in equivalence ratio and pres- sure have, respectively, an impact of leading and ﬁrst order on the downstream entropy ﬂuctuations. A change in downstream entropy (thus, density) implies a modulation of the downstream velocity u′ 2, due to mass conservation. On the other hand, the inﬂuence of ﬂame movement u′ s can- not be determined a priori in the general case.Eq. (38) shows that ﬂame movement u′ s will result from an imbalance between up- stream ﬂow velocity u′ 1 and speciﬁc volume consumption rate ˙V′ of the ﬂame. The latter depends – see Eq. (35)–o nt h er e s p o n s eo f ﬂame area and ﬂame speed to upstream ﬂow perturbations. These effects are non-trivial, and require advanced analytical treatments and detailed experimental or numerical studies. Nonetheless, it is possible to make simplistic assumptions on the ﬂame response and explore the consequences, in order to high- light the role of the ﬂame movement on the acoustic coupling across the ﬂame. In this section, two limiting cases are analyzed: The ﬁrst case concerns a passive, moving ﬂame, which is convected around its mean position by velocity perturbations The other case, on the contrary, is a ﬂame at rest. On both cases, perfect premixture (φ′ = 0) will be considered, and we assume the upstream ﬂow to the isentropic,s′ 1 = 0. Only the consequences for downstream velocity u′ 2 will be discussed, since to leading order pressure and entropy are not inﬂuenced by the ﬂame front movement in the case of a premixed ﬂame (see Eq. (42)). 6.01. Limit case I: passive moving ﬂame According to Eq. (43),t h ei n t e r d e p e n d e n c i e sb e t w e e nﬂ o wp e r - turbations, ﬂame movement and heat release imply for a passive ﬂame with ˙Q′ = 0 t h a t u′ 1 = u′ s + O(M).

Strobio Chen et al, Propagation and generation of acoustic and entropy waves across a moving ﬂame front, Combustion and Flame,http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2016.001.0015 8 L. Strobio Chen et al / Combustion and Flame 000 1–11 ARTICLE IN PRESS JID: CNF [m 5 G;February 10, 2016;18:7] The coupling relations across the ﬂame – see the ﬁrst line of Eq. (42) –i m p l yi nt h i sc a s et h a t u′ ¯u 2 = u′ ¯u 1 λ + O(M). (52) Due to mass conservation Eq. (17), ¯u 1λ = ¯u 2, and we conclude that for a passive, perfectly premixed ﬂame u′ 1 = u′ s + O(M) = u′ 2 + O(M). (53) The physical interpretation of this result is very simple: the ﬂame as a whole is convected back and forth by the velocity per- turbations, such that ﬂame movementu′ s corresponds perfectly to u′ 1 at every instant. There are – by assumption – no ﬂuctuations of heat release rate, ˙Q′ = 0, such that the conditionu′ 2 = u′ 1 appears obvious. In the limiting case of vanishing Mach number, M = 0, there is no transport of premixture towards the ﬂame, such that heat release rate ¯˙Q and ﬂame speed Sf must also vanish. This lim- iting case then corresponds to a temperature discontinuity, which is convected back and forth by the velocity perturbations. The analysis of this limiting case of apassive, moving ﬂame re- solves the paradox of mass vs. volume ﬂow rate conservation that was discussed in the Introduction and Section 2. It is gratifying to see that volume ﬂow rate conservation follows in a very straight- forward manner from the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy plus the kinematic conditions at the ﬂame. The latter must be invoked, because it is not assumed that the ﬂame is at rest. 6.02. Limit case II: ﬂame at rest The second limit-case considers a ﬂame at rest, such thatu′ s = 0 even in the presence of ﬂow perturbation,u′ 1 ̸= 0. The interdepen- dencies in Eq. (41) resulting from the physics of the ﬂame require in this case that ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 + O(M). (54) Furthermore, the coupling relations(42) across a premix ﬂame demand that u′ ¯u 2 = u′ ¯u 1 + O(M), (55) which may be re-written as u′ 2 = ¯T 2 ¯T 1 u′ 1 + O(M). (56) This result is in agreement with the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot relations (13) and corresponds to “naive’’ application of the conti- nuity equation to ﬂow across a heat source: the velocity ﬂuctua- tions downstream exceed those upstream as an effect of the tem- perature jump. Returning to the physics of the problem, we realize with Eq. (38) that the ﬂame can only be at rest if the speciﬁc vol- ume consumption of the ﬂame is always equal to the upstream velocity, ˙V′ = u′ 1. This condition results from the constraint that for a perfectly premixed ﬂame, each ﬂuid element passing through the ﬂame experiences the same increase of temperature.2 In other words, the ﬂame would have to respond to a modulation of up- stream velocity u′ 1 by adjusting the ﬂame area or ﬂame speed in such a manner, that the volume consumption rate is at each in- stant in time equal to the upstream velocity. This scenario might be a valid description of realistic ﬂame behavior in the limit of 2 This constraint would be violated in the case of incomplete combustion or heat loss, but such effects are not considered here. low frequencies. However, the response of a premix ﬂame to ﬂow perturbations is characterized by convective time lags. Thus one must conclude that in order to describe ﬂame–acoustic coupling, the model of a heat source that is free to change its position in response to ﬂow perturbations should be used in the general case (u′ s ̸= 0). 7. Discussion of previous works Chu formulated the relations which describe the coupling of acoustic disturbances across a moving, compact ﬂame front. The present study adopted Chu’s moving ﬂame model to a quasi- 1 D framework, and explored consequences for coupling relations and generation of entropy waves. In the following, previous works related to these issues shall be re-visited, in order to further clar- ify the interdependencies among unsteady heat release rate, ﬂame kinematic response, acoustics and entropy generation. 7.01. Survey of other moving ﬂame front jump conditions Blackshear proposed matching conditions for velocity and density across a ﬂame front that involve a “ﬂame volume”Vf, ADu 1(t) = Af (t)Sf + ∂Vf (t) ∂t, (57) ADu 2(t) = Af (t)Sf ρ1 ρ2 + ∂Vf (t) ∂t, (58) where AD is the area of the duct and Af the area of the ﬂame front. The variation in time of the ﬂame volume Vf(t)d e c o u p l e s the rate of incoming volume ﬂow from the volume consumption rate of premixture at the ﬂame front. This introduces an additional degree of freedom into the model of Blackshear, equivalent to the relaxation of the condition that the ﬂame be at rest. The ﬂame front velocity in the laboratory ﬂameus does not ap- pear explicitly in Blackshear’s analysis. But the relation to the ideas discussed in the present paper can be elucidated quite easily. Com- bining the above equations, one obtains: ρ2 u 2(t) − ρ1 u 1(t) = (ρ2 − ρ1 ) AD ∂Vf (t) ∂t (59) In steady state, the partial derivative in time in Eq. (59) is zero, incoming and outgoing volume ﬂow and volume consumption at the ﬂame front are equal to each other. In the unsteady case, the rate of change of the ﬂame volume∂Vf (t)/∂t = Af (t)Sf − ADu 1(t), see Eq. (57).S u b s t i t u t i n gt h i sr e s u l ti n Eq. (59) yields ρ2 u 2(t) − ρ1 u 1(t) = (ρ2 − ρ1 ) ( Af (t)Sf AD − u 1(t) ), (60) which should be interpreted as a combination of the mass con- servation across a moving ﬂame front Eq. (17) and the kinematic balance at the ﬂame front Eq. (35). Dowling adopted the formalism of Blackshear for the analytical study of a premixed ﬂame anchored on a ﬂame holder. Presuming a V-shaped ﬂame front, it was possible to relate ﬂuc- tuations in ﬂame volume Vf to those of ﬂame surface area Af and heat release rate ˙Q.C o m p a r et h i st ot h ef o r m a l i s md e v e l o p e di n the present study, which does not presume a certain ﬂame shape, but instead requires a transfer function for the heat release rate Fu or the ﬂame velocity Gu to achieve closure, see Section 4.03.O n e may conclude that the formulations of Chu and Blackshear both share an important feature, i.e. they decouple the rates of incoming ﬂow and volume consumption by introducing an ad- ditional degree of freedom, i.e. ﬂame movementus and ﬂame vol- ume Vf,r e s p e c t i v e l y.H o w e v e r,t h ec o n c e p t u a ld i f f e r e n c e sb e t w e e n the two formulations resulted in further development of the mod- els in different directions.

(39)and (40) can be also found in the work by Merk.N o t e,h o w e v e r,t h a t M e r k considers only perfectly premixed ﬂames, and mainly focused on the contributions of ﬂame area (or volume) and upstream density. Pelcé and Rochwerger adopted the moving ﬂame model for the description of vibratory instability in cellular ﬂames. Their analysis recovers the quasi 1-D formulation used in the present pa- per, the kinematic balance at the ﬂame front (see Eqs. (6)–(9) in ) is given in the same form as in Eq. (38). In the more recent literature on 1-D analysis of thermoacoustic systems, see e.g.t h em o v i n gﬂ a m em o d e l( i. e.t h ek i n e - matic balance at the ﬂame front) has not found extensive applica- tion. The reason lies perhaps in the fact that the ﬂame front move- ment u′ s only appears in the mass conservation equation, while in the energy conservation equation it is found only in terms of higher order in Mach number (see Eq. (22)). Thus the differences between the energy conservation equation in the moving model and the model of the heat source at rest are not readily apparent. As noted in Section 3,t h e R a n k i n e – H u g o n i o tr e l a t i o n sf o ru′ and p′ are exact for ﬂuctuations up to ﬁrst order in Mach and the ﬂame kinematics can be accounted for implicitly in the ﬂuctuating heat release rate ˙Q′.I n c o n s i s t e n c i e sb e t w e e nt h et w om o d e l sa r i s ea s soon as entropy generation is taken into consideration. 7.02. Flame kinematics and unsteady heat release Schuermans in the analysis of a premixed, turbulent, swirl stabilized ﬂame, proposed two different closures for a simplistic ﬂame model, featuring only acoustic and equivalence ratio ﬂuc- tuations. In one model the ﬂame is at rest at an axial position (refer to Eq. (17) in ), while the other model regarded the ﬂame as a discontinuity ﬂuctuating around a mean position(refer to Eq. (30) in). The system transfer matrix featuring the mov- ing ﬂame model gave a better agreement with experiments. The model of ﬂame at rest can be recovered in our analysis from Eq. (40),a s s u m i n gt h a tu′ s = 0 a n d ˙V′ = u′ 1 in every instant. The moving ﬂame model can be recovered from Eq. (40),c o n s i d e r i n g that the ﬂame speed and the ﬂame area are both constant, i.e. u′ s = u′ 1 and ˙V′ = 0. The unsteady heat release rate in the moving ﬂame model is mainly due to equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations. The ﬂame area, however, was considered as constant in this work. In his review on the modeling of premixed combustion, Lieuwen (see [28, Eqs. (34)–(39)]) made an explicit distinction be- tween the heat release rate due to changes in ﬂame area˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|u′ and the share due to changes in equivalence ratio˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|φ′.I nt h e context of Lieuwen’s analysis, the ﬂame can be modeled as:3 ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = ˙Q′ ¯˙Q ⏐⏐⏐ u′ + ˙Q′ ¯˙Q ⏐⏐⏐ φ′ = A′ f ¯Af + ∫ /Delta 1 h′ Rd ¯Af ∫ /Delta 1¯h Rd ¯Af, (61) where /Delta 1 h R is the heat of reaction, which is function of the equiva- lence ratio. Eq. (61)is the same formulation as Eq. (40) up to lead- ing order. The former quantity ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|u′ depends on the response of the ﬂame surface A′ f / ¯Af to upstream velocity ﬂuctuations. In our analysis, ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|u′ corresponds to the change in total volume consumption rate ˙V′/ ¯˙V in Eq. (36).O nt h eo t h e rh a n d,˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|φ′ is related exclusively to the generation of the temperature inho- mogeneities downstream. In the quantiﬁcation of the downstream entropy waves, it is useful to separate the unsteady heat release rate associated to inhomogeneities in the premixture, from the un- steady heat release rate due to modulations in mass ﬂow rate. 3 The sensitivity of the local ﬂame speed Sf to equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations is not discussed here. Such distinction is useful because the area change only governs the amount of the premixture being burnt instantaneously, while the temperature jump is a function of the enthalpy of the premixture only. When determining generation of entropy waves by a premix ﬂame, only the unsteady heat release per unit of mass should be taken into account. According to the formalism above, this corre- sponds to ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|φ′. Accounting explicitly for the ﬂame front move- ment u′ s in the jump relations allows to decouple the entropy pro- duction s′ 2 from ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|u′, as shown in Eqs. (34) and (42).O nt h e other hand, the model of a heat source at rest does not allow for such decoupling. 7.03. Models of entropy production by a compact heat source Dowling analyzed the entropy production across a com- pact heat source at rest. Her analysis yields for the downstream entropy: s′ cp = ( 1 − 1 λ )( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q − u′ ¯u 1 − p′ ¯p 1 ), (62) where ˙Q(t) is the total heat release rate per unit of volume. Eq. (62) shows that, in the case of a heat source at rest (e.g. a heated wire or a heat exchanger) entropy waves are determined predominantly by the unsteady heat release rate (or heat transfer rate) and upstream velocity ﬂuctuations, given that pressure per- turbations are of higher order in Mach number. Note that Dowling also distinguishes between the total heat release per unit of vol- ume and per unit of mass, respectively, which is crucial for the correct prediction of entropy generation. These conclusions are in agreement with the analysis presented in Section 5. However, the reader is cautioned that Eq. (62) is not applicable for perfectly premixed ﬂames, unless ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q = u′ 1/ ¯u 1, i.e. if |FTF | = 1, which is in general not the case. Eq. (50) may be satisﬁed in general only if the ﬂame front to is allowed to move (i.e.u′ s ̸= 0). Cumpsty presented results in terms of downstream en- tropy production as a function of Mach number and non- dimensional frequency. The kinematic balance at the ﬂame front was not considered. However, Cumpsty made a reasonable pre- diction of the entropy waves, because he considered the mass- speciﬁc energy equation, instead of the total energy conservation equation. The entropy ﬂuctuations downstream are formulated as: s′ 2/cp = q′/cp ¯T 1, where q′ corresponds to the mass-speciﬁc heat re- lease. This treatment is in line with the arguments put forward in Section 5.C u m p s t y ’ sr e s u l t sf o rd o w n s t r e a me n t r o p yﬂ u c t u a t i o n s in function of frequency are mainly constant, and not frequency- dependent, as Eq. (62) would suggest. In the work of Polifke et al on the coupling between en- tropy and acoustic waves at a chocked exit, only ﬂuctuations in heat release rate that are due to changes in fuel mass fraction (˙Q′ YF ) were accounted for in the determination of the strength of down- stream entropy waves. Fluctuations in the momentary consump- tion rate due to coherent vortices contribute to perturbations in heat release rate, but do not contribute to the generation of en- tropy waves. Again, this treatment is in complete agreement with the arguments developed above. Finally, it is noted that in case the ﬂow through the heated re- gion is not subject to a kinematic balance as would be the case heat exchangers or hot wires, the previous works on discontinu- ities at rest (Dowling)a n dt h ec o n s i d e r a t i o n so nt h el i m i to f vanishing Mach number by Nicoud and Wieczorek and Bauer- heim et al represent a complete and solid analysis of the mechanisms of acoustic scattering and entropy generation.

Conclusions In this paper, a detailed analysis of the conservation equations for acoustic and entropy perturbations across a moving heat source has been carried out. The analysis allows to develop a deeper un- derstanding of the inﬂuence of the ﬂame front movement on the acoustic scattering and entropy generation. At the same time, it re- solves paradoxical conclusions that result from the assumption of aﬂ a m ef r o n ta tr e s ti nap h y s i c a l l yi n t u i t i v em a n n e r. Important consequences on the substantial generation of en- tropy waves by a premixed ﬂame were elucidated. Removing the hypothesis of the ﬁxed position of the heat source and invoking instead kinematic balance at the ﬂame front, it has been demon- strated that to leading order in Mach number temperature inho- mogeneities downstream of a premixed ﬂame are associated ex- clusively with inhomogeneities in the mass-speciﬁc heat of reac- tion of the premixture, i.e. the fuel concentration. In the absence of equivalence ratio perturbations, and assuming complete com- bustion without signiﬁcant heat loss due to convection or radia- tion, only a small amount of entropy ﬂuctuations may be gener- ated. These terms are of ﬁrst order in Mach number, and result from interactions between upstream acoustics and the mean heat release rate. In addition, the conservation laws for mass, momentum and en- ergy at vanishing Mach number plus the kinematic matching con- ditions at a moving ﬂame imply that the conservation of volume ﬂow rate across a passive heat source follows in a very straightfor- ward manner from mass conservation.

Appendix A. Analysis of terms of ﬁrst order in entropy generation In Section 5 it was shown that to leading order entropy ﬂuc- tuations downstream of a premixed ﬂame are exclusively due to inhomogeneities in the equivalence ratio of the upstream premix- ture φ′. In the absence of equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations, entropy waves are of ﬁrst order in Mach number, s′ cp = ( 1 − 1 γ ) ( 1 λ − 1 ) p′ ¯p 1    O(M). (A.1) The physical mechanism that leads to these terms is unclear. How are entropy waves generated in absence of inhomogeneities in the premixture? In this section, we will give a detailed explana- tion of such interaction. The jump across the ﬂame, at very low Mach numbers, can be regarded as an isobaric process at ﬁrst order of approximation, see Eq. (31), with mass-speciﬁc heat addition q 1→2 = ∫ 2 dq = ∫ 2 Tds = ∫ 2 cpd T = cp(T 2 − T 1 ). (A.2) Fig. A.2. The steady and unsteady heat transfer process represented in the T–s plane. It should be noted that the isobaric curves in the T–s plane are not drawn to scale, but serve only to give a qualitative description of the unsteady heat release process. In fact, in the real scale the two curves are much closer, therefore also the change in temperature (T 1) is very small. The corresponding change in speciﬁc entropy equals s 2 − s 1 = ∫ 2 ds = ∫ 2 cp d T T = cp log T 2 T 1. (A.3) Combining these two results, which are an expression of the 1 st and 2 nd Law of Thermodynamics, one formulates for mean quan- tities ( ¯s 2 − ¯s 1 ) = ¯q ¯Tex (A.4) where Tex ≡ T 2 − T 1 log(T 2/T 1 ) (A.5) is the logarithmic mean temperature of the heat release process and ¯q, for a premixed ﬂame, is equal to the speciﬁc heat of reac- tion of the premixture. For a perfect premixture, the heat of reaction is constant, and so is the associated temperature jump T 2 − T 1. In presence of acous- tics, however, the upstream pressure perturbation may cause a change in upstream temperature, p′ 1 → T′ 1.A sac o n s e q u e n c e,t h e mean temperature of heat release¯Tex is also slightly altered. ( ¯s 2 − ¯s 1 ) + s′ = ¯q ¯Tex + T′ ex. (A.6) These qualitative considerations suggest that when upstream conditions (p′ 1, T′ 1)u n d e r g os m a l lv a r i a t i o n sb e c a u s eo fa c o u s t i c perturbations, a change in downstream entropy occurs, even in ab- sence of unsteady heat release. In order to determine the dependence of downstream entropy ﬂuctuations on upstream acoustic perturbations, we consider isen- tropic upstream condition (s′ 1 = 0) and the linearized state equa- tion for perfect gases, and reformulate Eq. (A.1) as: s′ cp = ( 1 λ − 1 ) T′ ¯T 1 = T′ ( ¯T 2 − 1 ¯T 1 ), (A.7) which shows that the entropy waves downstream are related to the temperature changes occurred upstream because of acoustic ﬂuctuations. For an increase in upstream temperature, the associ- ated entropy change is negative. This is directly explained by the 2 nd Law of Thermodynamics, which states that, the higher the temperatures at which the heat addition occurs, the lower the in- crease in entropy. The interaction between acoustics and mean heat release is well described in the T–s plane. In Fig. A.2 two isobaric curves are represented in the T–s plane.

It is obvious that the entropy at point 2 is lower than the entropy at point¯2. In order to suppress any en- tropy wave downstream, an increase in heat release rate would be required, such that the ﬁnal state of the combustion is at point 2 iso. It is generally understood that the interaction between acous- tics and a heat source produces entropy waves. Our analysis shows that in the case of aperfectly premixed ﬂame the generation of en- tropy waves is only associated with upstream acoustics andmean heat release, but not ﬂuctuations of heat release˙Q′! Consequently, entropy waves downstream a perfectly premixed ﬂame should not be identiﬁed with the ﬂuctuations in the total heat release rate. Moreover, these ﬂuctuations are ﬁrst order in Mach and are negli- gible for M ≪ 1. Of course, this argument assumes complete com- bustion as well as the absence of heat losses due to convective or radiative heat transfer. These results must be taken into account when discussing the role of entropy waves in thermoacoustic in- stability or indirect combustion noise. References F. Marble, S.

The prevalent description of entropy waves generation regards the ﬂame front as a source of heat at rest. Such a model leads - in its simplest form - to an entropy source term that depends exclusively on the unsteady response of the heat release rate and upstream velocity perturba- tions. However, in the case of a perfectly premixed ﬂame, which has a constant and homogeneous fuel / air ratio and thus con- stant temperature of combustion products, generation of entropy waves (i.e. temperature inhomogeneities) across the ﬂame is not expected. The present study analyzes and resolves this inconsis- tency, and proposes a modiﬁed version of the quasi 1-D jump relations, which regards the ﬂame as a moving discontinuity, in- stead of a source at rest. It is shown that by giving up the hy- pothesis of a ﬂame at rest, the entropy source term is related upto leading order in Mach number to changes in equivalence ratio only. To supplement the analytical results, numerical simulations of a Bunsen-type 2 D premixed ﬂame are analysed, with a focus on the correlations between surface area, heat release and posi- tion of the ﬂame on the one hand, and entropy ﬂuctuations down- stream of the ﬂame on the other. Both perfectly premixed as well as ﬂames with ﬂuctuating equivalence ratio are considered. ∗Address all correspondence to this author.

Entropy waves (also called ”hot spots”) are related to temperature inho- mogeneities generated by the unsteady combustion process. As ﬁrst observed by Marble and Candel, the downstream tem- perature inhomogeneities, when accelerated (e.g. through a noz- zle), generate acoustic waves from the acceleration zone. The up- stream propagating component of these acoustic waves impinge on the ﬂame and may trigger low-frequency thermoacoustic in- stabilities. This mechanism of combustion instability has been studied by several authors [2–9]. A number of studies consid- ered the dispersion of entropy waves, and the generation of acoustic waves from entropy waves in a nozzle. Compara- tively, little research has been done on the generation of entropy waves by a premix ﬂame and, to the best knowledge of the au- thors, a critical validation of the proposed relations between en- tropy ﬂuctuations s′and unsteady heat release rate ˙Q′, has not yet been carried out. Understanding such interdependency is crucial for the identiﬁcation of entropy sources and the control of insta- bilities generated by the indirect combustion noise. The present study analyzes the mechanism of generation of entropy waves across a premixed ﬂame. The goal is to clarify the relation be- tween perturbations of velocity or equivalence ratio, ﬂame move- ment, unsteady heat release rate and generation of entropy waves. It will be demonstrated that the proper analytical modeling of en- tropy generation should adopt the description of the ﬂame front as a moving discontinuity, and how the model of the ﬂame at rest gives an incorrect estimation of downstream entropy. To sup- port the analytical models, numerical results from simulations of laminar premixed ﬂames will be analyzed and discussed. ESTIMATION OF ENTROPY PRODUCTION BY THE MODEL OF A FLAME AT REST In the formulation of the jump conditions across a compact ﬂame, the ﬂame sheet is often regarded as a discontinuity of neg- ligible thickness, ﬁxed at a mean position. Across the ﬂame front, the conservation equations for linear perturbations in mass, mo- mentum and energy up to ﬁrst order in Mach number read : ρ′ ¯ρ2 −ρ′ ¯ρ1 + u′ ¯u 2 −u′ ¯u 1 = 0, (1) p′ ¯p 2 = p′ ¯p 1 + O(M 2), (2) ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = cp(T ′ 2 −T ′ 1) cp( ¯T 2 −¯T 1) + O(M 2) (3) where cp( ¯T 2 −¯T 1) is the increase in mass-speciﬁc sensible en- thalpy (∆h). Considering the linear relation between the ﬂuctua- tion in entropy and the thermodynamic variables p,ρ and T : s′ cp = p′ ¯pγ −ρ′ ¯ρ = (1 γ −1 )p′ ¯p + T ′ ¯T (4) and isentropic upstream ﬂow (s′ 1 = 0), the downstream variation in entropy reads : s′ cp = ( 1 −1 λ )( ˙Q′ ¯˙Q −u′ ¯u 1 − p′ ¯p 1 O(M) ). (5) Equation (5) relates the entropy produced by a ﬂame front to the unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic perturbations in ve- locity and pressure. Since the non-dimensional ﬂuctuations in pressure are ﬁrst order in Mach number, they are neglected in the following. Equation (5) suggests that entropy is always produced downstream of a heat source, if the change in heat release rate ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q is not equal to the change in upstream velocityu′/ ¯u. Phys- ically, such condition states that the perturbations in entropy are due to the unsteadiness in the mass-speciﬁc heat release rate, as noted by Dowling and Stow. Further discussion of this equa- tion and its implications are given by Strobio Chen et al. The frequency response of the heat release rate of the ﬂame 1 to upstream velocity perturbations is deﬁned as: F(ω) ≡ ˙Q′(ω)/ ¯˙Q u′ 1(ω)/ ¯u 1. (6) Eq. (5) can now be reformulated as: s′ 2(ω) cp = ( 1 −1 λ )( F(ω) −1 )u′ ¯u 1 + O(M), (7) which yields for the frequency response of entropy to upstream velocity: E(ω) ≡s′ 2(ω)/cp u′ 1/ ¯u 1 = ( 1 −1 λ )( F(ω) −1 ) + O(M). (8) Obviously, the model of a ﬂame at rest implies that leading order entropy waves will be generated by ﬂow perturbations unless the ﬂame frequency response F(ω) is unity. 1 This quantity if often called the ﬂame transfer function (FTF), but strictly speaking it should be called the frequency response. 2 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME FIGURE 1. VELOCITY STREAMLINES AND TEMPERATURE FIELD OF THE 2 D SLIT FLAME Considerations on perfectly premixed ﬂames Now perfectly premixed ﬂames are considered, where equivalence ratio is constant and thus φ′= 0. In the limit of zero frequency, the ﬂame frequency response of a perfectly pre- mixed ﬂame approaches unity, F →1, as discussed by Polifke and Lawn. In this limit, no entropy perturbations up to lead- ing order in Mach number are produced. However, as frequency ω increases, |F(ω)|deviates from unity in general and Eqs. (7) and (5) imply that leading order entropy waves are generated. Yet, the generation of leading order temperature inhomo- geneities is unphysical. This is due to the fact that perfectly premixed ﬂames feature a constant air/fuel ratio, i.e. a constant mass-speciﬁc enthalpy and temperature jump. It would be more physically intuitive to state that downstream temperature inho- mogeneities take place, only when ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio are present in the premixture. Equation (5), however, does not give any information on the dependency of the total heat re- lease rate on the equivalence ratio of the premixture. At this stage, it is necessary to develop a better understand- ing of the mechanism involved in the generation of temperature inhomogeneities downstream. The goal of this study is to to shed light on the interplay among upstream acoustic and equivalence ratio perturbations (u′ 1,φ′ 1), and the system response, in terms of unsteady heat release, and entropy generation ( ˙Q′,s′ 2). To this end, 2 D numerical simulations of a premixed, lami- nar ﬂame are carried out, in presence of ﬂuctuations of velocity and equivalence ratio. Numerical study of a 2 D premixed ﬂame The system considered for this analysis is a lean premixed “slit ﬂame” stabilized downstream of a sudden expansion. The CFD domain, which is 2 D and Cartesian, is depicted in Fig. 1. The inlet duct has a width of 1 mm, while the combustion cham- ber has a width of 2.05 mm, as in the work of Kornilov et al and Silva et al. The methane/air premixture has an equiv- alence ratio of ¯φ = 0.08. Mean velocity and temperature at the inlet are, respectively, ¯u 1 = 1.00 m/s and ¯T 1 = 293 K. Adiabatic conditions are imposed at the walls, in order to rule out possible sources of heat dispersion and entropy generation. Under these conditions, the mean temperature of the burnt gases is ¯T 2 = 2003 K. The ratio between downstream and upstream temperatures is λ ≈6.03. A two-step chemistry is used for the combustion model, c.f. The 2 D compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved by means of the CFD software A VBP, developed at CERFACS and IFP-EN 2. A second-order Lax-Wendroff scheme is used for spatial and temporal discretization. The maximum CFL num- ber is set to 0.07. To allow both the transmission of acoustic waves across the inlet and outlet boundaries without reﬂection, and the imposition of an acoustic excitation signal at the in- let, the Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Conditions with wave-masking are adopted (see Poinsot et al and Polifke et al ). A random-binary signal with low levels of auto- correlation has been imposed at the inlet, as in. The fre- quency of the excitation ranges between 0 and 1000 Hz. For a more profound analysis of the entropy generation mechanism, the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuations of velocityu′and equiv- alence ratio φ′on the unsteady heat release rate ˙Q′(u′) are inves- tigated separately. Therefore, two test-cases have been taken into consideration: 1. a perfectly premixed ﬂame with only velocity perturbations u′imposed at the inlet; 2. a non-homogeneously premixed ﬂame, where ﬂuctuations in equivalence ratio φ′are imposed at the inlet, while velocity perturbations are absent (u′ 1 = 0). The results of this case are particularly relevant for ”technically premixed” ﬂames (also called ”practical premixed” ﬂames by some authors), where acoustic perturbations at the fuel injector can modulate the equivalence ratio of the premixture. The perturbation in equivalence ratio for case 2.) is deﬁned as: φ′ ¯φ = Y ′ CH 4 ¯YCH 4 −Y ′ O 2 ¯YO 2 =0, (9) where ﬂuctuations in oxygen mass fraction are imposed to be zero. In order to maintain disturbances of the incoming mass ﬂow equal to zero, so that the inlet velocity perturbations are zero, we must assure that Y ′ CH 4 +Y ′ O 2 +Y ′ N 2 = 0. Therefore, Y ′ N 2 = −Y ′ CH 4 is imposed at the inﬂow boundary. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Frequency responses for heat release rate and entropy are identiﬁed by a Box-Jenkins parametric model from time se- ries data generated with unsteady CFD calculations forced by a 2 www.cerfacs.fr/4-26334-The-A VBP-code.php 3 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME (a) (b) FIGURE 2. GAIN AND PHASE OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF HEAT RELEASE RATE TO UPSTREAM VELOCITY PERTURBATIONS, Fu(ω) random binary excitation signal. In the case of a perfectly pre- mixed ﬂame, perturbations of 10% of mean velocity are imposed at the inlet, while for the non-perfectly premixed case, the mag- nitude of the relative perturbations in mean equivalence ratio is 4.05%. A lower amplitude is chosen for equivalence perturbations in order to keep the ﬂame response in the linear regime. For the perfectly premixed ﬂame, the respective frequency responses for heat release rate and entropy to velocity perturba- tions are deﬁned as: Fu(ω) ≡ ˙Q′(ω)/ ¯˙Q u′ 1(ω)/ ¯u 1, Eu(ω) ≡s′ 2(ω)/cp u′ 1(ω)/ ¯u 1. (10) For the non-perfectly premixed case, one describes the response to ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio perturbations with frequency responses Fφ (ω) ≡ ˙Q′(ω)/ ¯˙Q φ′ 1(ω)/ ¯φ1, Eφ (ω) ≡s′ 2(ω)/cp φ′ 1(ω)/ ¯φ1. (11) The entropy ﬂuctuations s′ 2 are evaluated at the outlet of the do- main, at a single point on the centerline, 4 mm downstream from the tip of the ﬂame, by means of Eq. (4). For quasi-1 D analysis, entropy ﬂuctuations could also be determined as averages over the duct cross sectional area, in order to take into account the (a) (b) FIGURE 3. GAIN AND PHASE OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF ENTROPY TO UPSTREAM VELOCITY PERTURBATIONS,Eu(ω) effects of dispersion along various streamlines. Note that in the present case, averages over the outlet area yield frequency response functions that are virtually identical to the results pre- sented below (not shown). Entropy produced by a 2 D perfectly premixed ﬂame Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show gain and phase of the ﬂame fre- quency response Fu(ω) identiﬁed for the system in Fig. 1. Simu- lations with harmonic excitations are performed to validate the results obtained from random binary excitation signal. Good agreement is found between the two datasets. The ﬂame fre- quency response in Fig. 2(a) shows a typical low-pass ﬁlter be- havior. The low-frequency limit equals unity, and is therefore correctly captured (see Polifke and Lawn ). Equation (8) suggests that in the frequency domain the en- tropy frequency response should be specular to the ﬂame fre- quency response, i.e. exhibit high-pass ﬁlter behavior: At higher frequencies, as |Fu(ω)|approaches zero, the entropy ﬂuctuations should reach a maximum amplitude of (1/λ −1)u′ 1/ ¯u 1. How- ever, such behavior is not exhibited by the CFD results: Fig. 4(b) shows that in the time domain the ﬂuctuations in entropy (and temperature) are highest at low frequency, and decrease to zero for higher frequencies. The entropy frequency response, there- fore, has also a low-pass ﬁlter behavior. The small differences in the magnitude of |Eu(ω)|between broadband and harmonic excitation is due to the low amplitude of the response, which in- ﬂuences the signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore the quality of the 4 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME (a) FLUCTUATION IN HEAT RELEASE RATE ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q AND IN DOWN- STREAM ENTROPY s′ 2/cp FOR 300 HZ (b) FLUCTUATION IN DOWNSTREAM ENTROPY s′ 2/cp FOR 50, 150 and 300 HZ FIGURE 4. TIME SERIES OF ENTROPY W A VES AND UNSTEADY HEAT RELEASE RATE identiﬁcation. Figs. 3(a) (frequency domain) 4(a) (time domain) show that the amplitude |Eu(ω)|obtained from numerical simulation is several orders of magnitude smaller than |Fu(ω)|. Indeed, the ﬂuctuations are ﬁrst order in Mach number: The maximum amplitude of the entropy frequency response is approximately 0.09 ×10−3, which translates to ﬂuctuations of downstream tem- perature T ′ 2 of less than 2 K. Strobio Chen et al elucidate this mechanism of entropy wave generation and argue that it re- sult from an interaction of acoustics with mean heat release rate. Details are given in the Appendix of. Kinematic balance at the ﬂame front It becomes ev- ident, from the results in the previous section, that Eq. (7) does not give a correct prediction of the entropy production across a perfectly premixed ﬂame. In order to provide a valid model for such prediction, it is necessary to take the kinematic match- ing conditions at the ﬂame front into consideration. The kine- matic balance was ﬁrst used by Chu for the case of a plane ﬂame, by Blackshear in 2-D premixed ﬂames and later by Schuermans in the modeling of swirl-stabilized turbulent ﬂames. The mean heat release for a premixed ﬂame is expressed as : ¯˙Q = ¯Af ¯Sf ¯ρ1∆¯h = ¯˙VAD ¯ρ1∆¯h, (12) where ¯Af is the mean ﬂame surface, ¯Sf is the mean local ﬂame speed, ¯ρ1 the mean ﬂow density and∆¯h is the increase in sensible enthalpy per unit of mass. The ﬂame surface and ﬂame local speed contribute to the volume of premixture being burnt across the ﬂame front at a given instant of time.¯˙V represents the volume consumption rate of the ﬂame per unit of duct area AD. The linear perturbations in heat release rate in a perfectly premixed ﬂame are expressed as: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = A′ f ¯Af + S′ f ¯Sf + ρ′ ¯ρ1 + ∆h′ ∆h = ˙V ′ ¯˙V + ρ′ ¯ρ1 + ∆h′ ∆h. (13) The unsteadiness in the total heat release rate is mainly due to the contribution of unsteady mass ﬂow ρ′ 1/ ¯ρ1 + A′ f / ¯Af + S′ f / ¯Sf and to the change in sensible enthalpy per unit of mass∆h′/∆h. For a perfectly premixed ﬂame, ∆h′= 0 and S′ f = 0 (neglecting effects of ﬂame front curvature on the laminar ﬂame speed). Moreover, in absence of upstream entropy waves s′ 1 = 0, the ﬂuctuations in upstream density are ﬁrst order in Mach number ρ′ 1/ ¯ρ1 ∼O(M), and therefore could be neglected. The response in ﬂame surface represents the main contribution to the unsteady heat release rate. In the steady state, the mean volume ﬂux ¯u 1 AD is in equilibrium with the mean volume consumption rate of the ﬂame: AD ¯u 1 = ¯Af ¯Sf = ¯˙VAD. (14) In presence of velocity perturbations, the equilibrium condition expressed by Eq. (14) is not valid anymore, since the ﬂame re- sponds to upstream perturbations by changing the ﬂame surface Af. However, such response does not match the upstream per- turbations instantaneously, but is subject to convective time lags. The difference between u′ 1 and ˙V ′causes the ﬂame to move from its mean position: u′ ¯u 1 = ˙V ′ ¯u 1 + u′ s ¯u 1, (15) where u′ s is the movement of the ﬂame front with respect to the lab frame of reference, in the quasi-1 D framework. In the steady state, the ﬂame front does not move, since ¯u 1 = ¯˙V (see Eq. (14)). Consequently, the mean value of the ﬂame front velocity ¯ us is zero and in the unsteady caseus(t) =u′ s(t). Considering Eq. (15), the unsteady heat release rate for a perfectly premixed ﬂame can be rewritten as: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 −u′ s ¯u 1. (16) The movement of the ﬂame front must be taken into account in the conservation of mass ﬂow. In fact, while the mass ﬂow- ing through a ﬁxed heat source (i.e. a heat exchanger) depends 5 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME only on the upstream ﬂow velocity, in the case of a moving heat source, such as the premixed ﬂame, the mass crossing the dis- continuity depends not only on the upstream ﬂow speed u 1, but also on the speed of the discontinuity itself us: ˙m(t) =ρ1(u 1 −us) =ρ2(u 2 −us). (17) Equation (1) across a ﬂame front is rewritten as: ρ′ ¯ρ2 −ρ′ ¯ρ1 + u′ ¯u 2 −u′ ¯u 1 = (1 λ −1 )u′ s ¯u 1. (18) Across a moving ﬂame front, the solution of the linearized con- servation equations in terms of u′ 2/ ¯u 2, p′ 2/ ¯p 2 and s′ 2/cp is:   u′ ¯u 2 p′ ¯p 2 s′ cp  =   λ (1 λ −1 ) 0 1 0(1 λ −1 )( 1 λ −1 )     u′ ¯u 1 p′ ¯p 1 s′ cp   +   ( 1 −1 λ ) 0( 1 −1 λ )   ˙Q′ ¯˙Q +   0( 1 −1 λ )  u′ s ¯u 1 (19) A detailed derivation of the linearized conservation equa- tions across a moving ﬂame front is given in. Substituting Eq. (16) in the solution matrix Eq. (19) yields for the entropy production: s′ cp = ( 1 −1 γ )(1 λ −1 )p′ ¯p 1   O(M) + s′ cp =0. (20) Equation (20) gives a reasonable estimation of the entropy ﬂuctu- ations downstream a perfectly premixed ﬂame. Fig. 5 shows that the order of magnitude for low-frequency limit is correctly cap- tured. The phase delay between the entropy estimation and the actual entropy generation is due to the convective time between the upstream plane at which upstream ﬂuctuations are evaluated and the outlet plane, at which entropy is evaluated. ENTROPY PRODUCTION BY A NON-PERFECTLY PRE- MIXED FLAME The ﬂame and entropy frequency responses in presence of equivalence ratio perturbations are given in Fig. 6(a), 6(b) and Fig. 7(a), 7(b). The ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio are mea- sured at the inlet, at 1 [mm] from the ﬂame holder. In presence of FIGURE 5. THE RELATIVE AMPLITUDE OF THE ENTROPY W A VES AS PREDICTED IN EQ. (20) AND THE ENTROPY EXTRACTED AT THE OUTLET FOR THE CASE OF 50 HZ equivalence ratio perturbations, the unsteady heat release rate has a more complex formulation than in Eq. (16), since the perturba- tions in local ﬂame speed and in mass-speciﬁc sensible enthalpy cannot be neglected anymore. In fact, the local ﬂame speed is sensitive to the upstream equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations. Abu-Orf and Cant have suggested the relation Sf (φ) =AφBe−c(φ−D)2, (21) where A,B,C and D are empirical coefﬁcients. The change in mass-speciﬁc sensible enthalpy is also a function ofφ′. For small perturbation in φ′, we can write : ∆h′ ∆¯h = φ′ ¯φ. (22) According to Lieuwen, the ﬂame frequency response in presence of equivalence ratio ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q|φ consists of several contri- butions: Fφ (ω) = ˙Q′(ω)/ ¯˙Q φ′(ω)/ ¯φ = FH (ω) +FS(ω) (23) in which FH represents the change in the increase of mass- speciﬁc sensible enthalpy ∆h′ of the premixture in presence of φ′ and FS represents the effects on the volume consumption at the ﬂame front. The change in volume consumption, in this case, is due to the ﬂuctuations in local ﬂame speed, which is sensitive to the equivalence ratio of the premixture (see Eq. (21)), and due to the subsequent change in ﬂame surface. The relation between φ′ and ˙V ′ is non-trivial, since several effects act on the ﬂame shape and ﬂame surface. However, such complexity does not af- fect the modeling of the entropy frequency response. In fact, the change in ﬂame surface governs the total mass consumption of the premixture across the ﬂame. On the other hand, entropy, as 6 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME (a) (b) FIGURE 6. FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF HEAT RELEASE RATE TO PERTURBATIONS OF EQUIV ALENCE RATIO,Fφ (ω) well as temperature, is a mass speciﬁc quantity and does not de- pend on the total mass consumption, but on the inhomogeneities in the premixture φ′(see ). In fact, considering Eq. (22), we can express the unsteady heat release rate as: ˙Q′ ¯˙Q = u′ ¯u 1 −u′ s ¯u 1 + φ′ ¯φ (24) and substituting in Eq. (19), the solution for the downstream en- tropy is: s′ cp = ( 1 −1 λ )φ′ ¯φ   O(1) + ( 1 −1 γ )(1 λ −1 )p′ ¯p 1   O(M) + s′ cp. (25) Equation (25) expresses the fact that across a moving pre- mixed ﬂame front, leading order entropy generation depends solely on the presence of upstream ﬂuctuations in equivalence ratio. Fig. 7(a) and 7(b) show that the entropy generation has a low-pass ﬁlter behavior. This result agrees qualitatively with the analytical derivations of FH in the G-equation framework made by Lieuwen, Cho et al and Humphrey et al. The low-frequency limit of the entropy frequency re- sponse In the quasi-steady framework, the amplitude of Eφ should equal the factor (1 −1/λ), which is 0.085 in our case. However, (a) (b) FIGURE 7. FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF HEAT RELEASE RATE TO PERTURBATIONS OF EQUIV ALENCE RATIO,Eφ (ω) as shown in Fig. 7(a), the low frequency limit of the entropy fre- quency response is lower than (1 −1/λ), reaching a value close to 0.08 at low-frequency limit. This discrepancy, also shown in Fig. 8 for the case of 10 Hz, is due to several reasons. First, the ratio between ∆h′/∆h and φ′/ ¯φ is not exactly unity, because the conversion to products species is not complete. For lean premix- tures, Abu-Orf and Cant proposed the following empirical relation: ∆h = 2.09 ×106φ 1 + 0.005825φ. (26) For ¯φ = 0.08 this yield for the proportionality factor (∆h′/∆h)/(φ′/ ¯φ) ≈0.095. This impacts on the entropy, since ∆h′≈cp T ′ 2. The second reason is found in the fact that in real gases, cp is not constant, but a function increasing with temperature (see further considerations in Appendix A). Therefore, at higher temperatures, a higher variation in enthalpy is needed for a given ∆T. These two considerations suggest that the proportionality factor (1 −1/λ) represents an ”upper limit” to entropy generation. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK The correct estimation of entropy wave generation by un- steady combustion is crucial for prediction and control of ther- moacoustic instabilities and indirect combustion noise. In this 7 Copyright c⃝2016 by ASME FIGURE 8. THE RELATIVE AMPLITUDE OF THE ENTROPY W A VES AS PREDICTED BY EQ. (25) AND THE ENTROPY EV ALUATED AT THE OUTLET AS IN EQ. (4) FOR THE CASE OF 10 HZ paper, the mechanism of entropy waves generation in premixed ﬂames has been investigated. Numerical simulations, supported by analytical modeling, show that in the case of a perfectly premixed ﬂame, the gen- eration of entropy waves is negligible. In presence of equiva- lence ratio perturbations, on the other hand, leading order en- tropy waves are produced. In frequency domain, these waves have a low-pass ﬁlter behavior. The low-frequency limit of the entropy frequency response exhibits the highest gain, which is function of the temperature jump λ. It has been argued, by means of numerical results and phys- ical arguments, that the model of a heat source at rest cannot properly predict the amplitudes of temperature inhomogeneities downstream of a premixed ﬂame. Instead, it is necessary to re- formulate the conservation equations, by considering the ﬂame front as a moving discontinuity. This model relates the leading order downstream entropy to the equivalence ratio perturbations only. However, it should be noted that equivalence ratio perturba- tions are in general not the only source of entropy waves in com- plex combustion systems. The presence of non-adiabatic walls, cold gas injection and incomplete combustion might as well con- tribute to temperature inhomogeneities and thus to indirect com- bustion noise. Indeed, heat loss at combustor walls as well as injection of cold ﬂow (see, ) are frequently found in real combustor conﬁgurations. It would be beneﬁcial to extend the analytical model in the present work, such that ”secondary” en- tropy sources, due to heat loss, are also taken into account. This would require to resolve the variability of entropy wave gener- ation across various streamlines. A ﬁrst step in this direction is the formulation of a quasi-1 D model for the entropy frequency response that includes both molecular dissipation and streamline dispersion. This is the subject of ongoing work. Note that the model of a compact premixed ﬂame as a mov- ing discontinuity also resolve paradoxical results concerning the conservation of mass and volume ﬂow rates in the limit of van- ishing Mach number (see Bauerheim et al ). For details, the interested reader is referred to Strobio Chen et al.

Appendix A: Thermodynamic properties of real gases In real gases, the thermodynamic properties cp and γ are not constant, but vary in function of temperature. Since the combus- tion process can be approximated to an isobaric heating process, the variation in sensible enthalpy per unit of mass is: ∆h = ∫ T 2 T 1 cp(T )d T (27) In the present work, to evaluate enthalpy, a mean value of cp is chosen: ¯cp = ∫¯T 2 ¯T 1 cp(T )d T ( ¯T 2 −¯T 1) (28) such that: ∆h = ¯cp( ¯T 2 −¯T 1). However, the choice of cp and γ do not change the conclusions reached in this paper on entropy generation, since they only affect the pressure term (see Eq. (4)), which is negligible.

The objective of the study is to identify the frequency response of the heat transfer rate with respect to perturbations of ﬂow velocity, and the acoustic scattering matrix of the heat exchanger. These response functions are determined by CFD simulation of ﬂow with heat transfer combined with system identiﬁcation. Unsteadiness is imposed on the simulations by broad-band excitation of the variables at the boundaries. The resulting time series are post- processed to obtain the frequency responses. Particular emphasis is placed on the comparability between compressible and weakly compressible simulations in terms of heat release response. The response functions may be used subsequently in thermo-acoustic stability analysis of com- bustion systems. 1. Introduction The presence of heat exchangers in industrial applications is ubiquitous. Tthey can be found in most energy conversion systems, and are used in both cooling (industrial turbines, internal combus- tion engines) and hot water production systems (domestic heating, industrial boilers). Despite the wide range of applications, little is known about the thermo-acoustic scattering properties of heat exchangers, and about their role in system stability. This is due to the fact that heat exchangers are classiﬁed as heat sinks, which are often erroneously regarded as damping elements. Indeed, according to the Rayleigh criterion, instability may occur whenever the global Rayleigh index (evaluated in the volume of heat release V ) is positive over an oscillation cycle of period T : (1) G = Z V T Z T ˙q 0(x, t)p 0(x, t)dt dv> 0, where ˙q 0(x, t) is the heat release rate ﬂuctuation per unit volume andp 0(x, t) is the ﬂuctuation in pressure. This means that, in presence of acoustics, a heat sink might either damp or drive system instability, depending on the phase between the heat release ﬂuctuations and the pressure ﬁeld. In the present work, a typical conﬁguration of heat exchanger employed in domestic boilers (Fig. 2) is investigated numerically. The aim is to characterize the behavior of the heat exchanger in terms of its acoustic scattering matrix and its heat release response to upstream acoustic perturbations. The ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 1 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration results of the identiﬁcation can subsequently be used as input for an acoustic network model, in order to perform stability analysis. The choice of a numerical approach is justiﬁed by the fact that in experimental test rigs, it is very difﬁcult to measure the local instantaneous heat release rate. However, fully resolving the acoustics leads to very high computational costs. Therefore, in presence of low Mach and Helmholtz numbers, it is more convenient to treat the ﬂow as incompressible, For compact heat sources (He ⌧ 1), in which the geometrical length is much smaller than the acoustic wavelength, the incompressible-ﬂow approximation has some advantages: it is, in fact, computationally less expensive, and no acoustic reﬂections occur at the boundaries. Yet, in this speciﬁc case, the compactness is not always satisﬁed, since the Helmholtz number is in the range of He 2 [0, 0.05] (see Section 2.02.01). For this reason, is necessary to compare the incompressible simulation to a fully compressible case, in order to validate or discuss possible discrepancies. In the present study, since heat transfer takes place, a \"weakly compressible\"solver is proposed (see Section 2), which allows for changes in density depending solely on temperature. In section 2, the details of the simulation and system identiﬁcation procedure are given for both compressible and incompressible cases. In section 3, the results in terms of heat release ﬂuctuations will be discussed. In section 4, an analytical modeling of the heat exchanger element has been carried out, in order to shed light on the physical phenomena governing the acoustic scattering of the heat exchanger. The results are discussed in terms of acoustic scattering matrix coefﬁcients, and compared against the results from the fully compressible simulation, where direct identiﬁcation of the scattering behavior is possible. 2. Numerical Approach 2.01 Compressible and weakly-compressible simulation To create the time series necessary for system identiﬁcation, CFD simulations were used. For the fully compressible simulations (FCS), the standard solver buoyant Pimple Foam, developed in Open FOAM R\u0000, is used. buoyant Pimple Foam is apt for solving unsteady problems involving heat transfer and buoyancy effects. Neglecting the buoyancy effects, the local total pressure in buoyant- Pimple Foam is expressed as: (2) p(t, x)= pd(t, x)+ p 1, in which the instantaneous total pressure is a sum of the dynamic pressure (pd) and of the constant reference pressure (p 1). The weakly compressible simulation (WCS), on the other hand, adopts a modiﬁed version of the original solver. The main modiﬁcation concerns the relation density-pressure. In the WCS, the in- stantaneous pressurep(t) is used for the transport equations, while the thermodynamic model follows an isobaric approach. The equation of state for a perfect gas is in fact changed to: (3) ⇢(t, x)= p 1 RT (t, x), where R is the gas constant,T is the instantaneous temperature.p 1 is not the instantaneous pressure, but constant over time. Hence, density variations depend solely on temperature variations. 2.02 Simulation domain and boundary conditions 2.02.01 General numerical details In most hot water production systems, the heat exchanger (HX) and the hot gases are in a cross- ﬂow conﬁguration. The hot gases ﬂow through a row of cylinders and heat is transferred to the water 2 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration Hot gases Cold gases cold heat exchanger in cross-ﬂow Simulation domain Figure 1.The geometry of a combustion system with row of HX cylinders in cross-ﬂow no-slip walls no-slip walls HX HX ref. plane uupu Tu udpd Td 8 d 12 d 3 d d/2 s ref. plane Figure 2. The geometry of the domain. The blue region represents the HX ﬁlled with water at constant temperature THX =3 0 0 K. The ﬁgure is not drawn to scale. (see Fig. 1). In most applications, in order to optimize the heat exchange process, the surface of the cylinders is maximized with respect to the volume, therefore the cross section of the tubes are not cir- cular, but elongated. In this study, we consider a simple 2 D model (see Fig. 2), with two rectangular half tubes inside a channel. The height of the narrow channel between the tubes iss =0.8[ mm], while the diameter of the HX tube isd =1 2.08[ mm]. This domain represents a single portion of the periodic conﬁguration in Fig. 1. For the upper and lower boundaries, an adiabatic, no-slip wall condition is adopted instead of the cyclic boundary condition, in order to stabilize the downstream ﬂow, which shows relevant transversal velocity components after the sudden area expansion. The velocity of the hot gases at the inlet is¯uu =0.89 [m/s], which corresponds to a Mach number of Mu =1.28 · 10\u00003. The maximum velocity is reached at the beginning of the narrow channel,¯umax ⇡ 12 [m/s]. At the outlet, a constant pressure boundary condition has been set to¯pd =1 0 0 [k Pa ]. The temperature at the inlet is imposed at¯Tu =1 2 0 0 [K], while the temperature at the heat exchanger is assumed to be constant ¯THX =3 0 0[K]. The constant temperature assumption simpliﬁes the analysis. However, the ’oversized’ cooling in the HX implies that the temperature at the exit,¯Td =3 2 0 [K], is lower than in the real case. The ﬂow regime is laminar, since the highest Reynolds number in the domain is Remax =1 8 0. Taking the upstream speed of sound as reference value, the Helmholtz number (He =!LHX /¯cu) ranges from 0 to 0.045 for frequency range between 0 and 1500 Hz. A grid independence study has been carried out, in order to determine the level of reﬁnement in the HX channel which properly resolves the boundary layer, where most of the heat exchange takes place. As a result, the channel height (s) has been divided into 16 squared cells. 2.02.02 Fully compressible simulation In the fully compressible simulation the propagation of sound waves has to be resolved. The largest time step which allows to resolve the acoustic propagation properly is\u0000tmax = Comax· \u0000xmin ¯uu+¯cu ⇡ 7 · 10\u00008 [s], in which Comax equals unity, according to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. The time step used in the simulation is\u0000tfcs =5 · 10\u00008 [s], which corresponds to a maximum Courant number of Comax =0.7. ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 3 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration Because of the presence of acoustically reﬂecting boundary conditions, the steady state solution was obtained by applying the Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Conditions (NSCBCs) at inlet and outlet. These boundary conditions ensure an exponential decay (w.r.t. frequency) of the reﬂection coefﬁcient at the boundaries. However, partial reﬂection is still present at lower frequencies. 2.02.03 Weakly compressible simulation Concerning the weakly compressible simulation, the considerations on the mesh reﬁnement and initial conditions (¯u, ¯p, ¯T) are unchanged. However, since there is no propagation of acoustic waves in the domain, no manipulations are needed for the inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Moreover, the time step adopted (\u0000twcs =2 · 10\u00006 [s]) has only to satisfy the ﬂuid-dynamic CFL number and is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the\u0000tfcs. This makes the WCS suitable for generation of long time series (in the order of seconds), which is useful in the identiﬁcation of the acoustic response at low frequencies. 2.03 System excitation and identiﬁcation The behavior of a system in presence of acoustic disturbances is characterized by its heat release response to upstream velocity perturbations F(!): (4) F(!)= ˙Q 0(!)/ ¯˙Q u 0 u(!)/¯uu, where ˙Q 0 is the ﬂuctuation in heat release rate of the heat exchanger andu 0 u is the velocity probe at the reference plane (see Fig. 2); and by its acoustic scattering matrix: (5) ✓fd gu ◆ =  Tu!d Rd Ru Td!u \u0000✓ fu gd ◆, where f and g are, respectively, the waves propagating in downstream and upstream direction. They are related to the acoustic perturbations (p 0,u 0) as follows: (6) f = 1 ✓ p 0 ¯⇢¯c + u 0 ◆ g = 1 ✓ p 0 ¯⇢¯c \u0000 u 0 ◆. For the identiﬁcation of the heat release response F(!) in the FCS, a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) approach is adopted. After imposing an excitation signal (f) at the inlet, the model is iden- tiﬁed by considering the upstream velocity ﬂuctuations as the input and the ﬂuctuations in the in- stantaneous total heat release as the output. As for the scattering matrix, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) approach is used, in which excitation signals (fu, gd) are applied respectively at the inlet and outlet, and the outputs (fd, gu) are measured at the reference planes (see Fig. 2 ). The wavelet-based excitation signals present a constant power spectral density in the frequency range under investigation (f 2 [0; 1500]Hz) and are statistically uncorrelated. The identiﬁcation of the models from the time series is performed with the Box-Jenkins parametric model structure, in order to handle the noise deriving from the NSCBC partially reﬂecting boundaries. In the WCS a similar identiﬁcation process is pursued. However, the excitation signals imposed correspond tou 0 at the inlet in the SISO approach and tou 0 and p 0 respectively at inlet and outlet in the MIMO approach. This is because, in an incompressible simulation, all disturbances travel at inﬁnite speed and no acoustic wave (asf and g) can propagate across the domain. 3. Results from Compressible and Weakly Compressible Simulations In this section, the frequency response from the FCS and WCS are compared. Before analyzing the results, it is necessary to point out that the time series of the two simulations are not immediately 4 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration 0 0.010.020.030.040.0500.020.040.060.081 Gain (F)[ - ] He=ωLHX/¯cu FCSWCS 0 0.010.020.030.040.05−1.05 −1 −0.05 0 Phase (F)[ r a d ] He=ωLHX/¯cu FCSWCS Figure 3. Gain and phase of the HX transfer function for compressible (green-dashed line) and weakly-compressible (blue line) simulations comparable. In fact, in the compressible simulation, the signals ofu 0/¯u vary according to the position of the reference plane, since they are non-causal and derive from the superposition of the Riemann invariants f and g at the reference plane. In order to make the velocity signal space-invariant, it is necessary to ﬁrst manipulate the Riemann invariants of the reference plane, by shifting them to the position of the heat exchanger. Sincef and g travel in opposite directions, the time series off is shifted forward, whileg is shifted backwards for the upstream velocity. The time associated to the shift for f is: ⌧(f)=\u0000 x/(¯c +¯ u), while forg is: ⌧(g)=\u0000 x/(¯c \u0000 ¯u), where \u0000x is the distance between the reference plane and the HX and¯c and ¯u are the mean speed of sound and ﬂow velocity, respectively. Being the shifted time seriesf⇤ and g⇤, it is possible to reconstruct the space-invariant velocity signal asu 0⇤ = f⇤ \u0000g⇤. The heat exchanger transfer function for the compressible simulation is therefore expressed as in Eq. (4), withu 0⇤ as ﬂuctuating velocity. 3.01 Frequency response of heat transfer Given the quasi-steady approximation used in the WCS, differences in gain and phase are expected for higher frequencies. However, the results in Fig 3 do not show any substantial difference between the transfer functions. Slight departures show at He =0.2, but the difference in both gain and phase are negligible. This means that the weakly compressible simulation can capture with a good approximation all the ﬂuid-dynamic features of the system, such as heat release and the changes in the velocity ﬁeld, up to the frequency range considered (f 2 Hz). Signiﬁcant difference only shows in the phase startin from He ⇡ 0.048. 3.02 Low frequency limit of the heat release response The transfer function of the HX shows a low-pass ﬁlter behavior. Such behavior is common in the transfer functions of most heat sources, particularly in ﬂames. However, as argued in and experimentally demonstrated in, the zero-frequency limit of the transfer function in perfectly premixed ﬂames should equal unity. Here, the low frequency limit of the heat exchanger transfer function is lower than 1. In order to explain such difference, it is necessary to analyze the physics involved in the heat exchanger. In it is shown how the response of heat sources in the low- frequency limit can be derived from global conservation equations in quasi steady state. The enthalpy balance for the HX is: (7) ˙Q =˙m\u0000h = Aﬂowuu⇢ucp(Tu \u0000 Td), where Aﬂow is the cross section of the channel,uu⇢u is the mass ﬂow rate andcp(Tu \u0000 Td) is the speciﬁc enthalpy transferred from the hot gases to the HX. Considering that, in presence of low Mach numbers and acoustic disturbances only, the normalized density ﬂuctuation is negligible w.r.t. the ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 5 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration F(!)

Eq. (8) shows that the transfer function of the HX is lower than unity, whenever the ﬂuctuation in downstream temperature is positive. In order to correlate the downstream temperature ﬂuctuation T 0 d to the velocity ﬂuctuationu 0 u, we consider the local temperature function in a simple 2 D channel geometry: Td = THX +( Tu \u0000 THX)exp ✓\u0000Nu 1\u0000L 2⇢uuus 2 cp ◆.(9) Assuming that ﬂuctuations in temperature are only caused by velocity ﬂuctuations, it may be argued that T 0 d can be approximated as T 0 d(u 0 u) ⇡ d ¯Td d¯uu u 0 u, which gives for the low frequency limit of F: lim!0 F =1 \u0000 ¯Tu \u0000 THX ¯Tu \u0000 ¯Td Nu 1\u0000L 2¯⇢uuus 2 cp exp ✓\u0000Nu 1\u0000L 2¯⇢uuus 2 cp ◆.(10) Eq. (10) shows that the lower frequency limit of the transfer function differs from unity, except from some limit cases, in which the product on the r.h.s is zero. This condition is veriﬁed for two cases: L!1 and s! 0. The ﬁrst limit case shows that only when a heat exchanger has inﬁnite surface, the downstream temperature ﬂuctuation is zero. In the second case, the height of the channel is inﬁnitesimally small, so the heat exchange takes place instantaneously via heat conduction. In real applications, neither of the cases cited above is veriﬁed. Therefore, the zero frequency limit of the heat exchanger transfer function is generally below unity. There are no exact analytical relations for the geometry of the HX under analysis, so no quantitative values oflim!0 F can be given for comparison. However, regardless of the geometry, the qualitative considerations given above are valid for any heat source (or sink) in which heat exchange is involved. 4. System Modeling As previous works have shown, the fully compressible simulation, combined with system identiﬁcation can give very reliable results in terms of acoustic scattering matrix and heat release re- sponse. The results obtained for scattering matrix from the identiﬁcation are shown in Fig. 5 (green line). Fully resolving the acoustic propagation is, however, more expensive in terms of computation efforts compared to the WCS. In this section, we will try to reproduce the scattering behavior identi- ﬁed with the FCS, using the results for the heat exchange rate obtained from the WCS. This modeling process not only gives insight into the scattering process at the HX, but would also enable the use of the incompressible simulation for describing acoustics of non-compact elements. In this attempt, we have modeled the system in Fig. 2 as a network of basic elements, as depicted in Fig. 4: As shown in Fig. 4, the heat exchanger is represented with all its geometric features, while the heat release is concentrated at the center of the network. This choice is justiﬁed by the fact that, for a reasonably high range of frequencies (f 2 Hz), the weakly compressible transfer function still gives a 6 ICSV 22, Florence, Italy, 12-16 July 2015 The 22 nd International Congress of Sound and Vibration good approximation of the heat transfer dynamics. Therefore, the heat source can still be considered as compact, at low Helmholtz numbers. The transfer functions in terms ofp 0 ¯⇢¯c and u 0 for the area change (ac) and the duct are: (11) TMac =  1 \u0000i!Leff /¯c i!Lred/¯c↵ \u0000,T M duct = 1 ⇣ eik\u0000L + e\u0000ik+L ⌘⇣ \u0000eik\u0000L + e\u0000ik+L ⌘ ⇣ \u0000eik\u0000L + e\u0000ik+L ⌘⇣ eik\u0000L + e\u0000ik+L ⌘ 5, where Leff =0.0064 [m] and Lred are end correction coefﬁcients, which depend on the ratio between the cross-sections (↵); as shown in, the value of Lred is negligible. In the transfer matrix of the duct L is the length of the channel andk± =! ¯c±¯u. Considering the Rankine-Hugoniot relations for thermoacoustics, the transfer matrix across a concentrated heat source is: (12) TMpu,RH = ¯⇢u¯cu ¯⇢d¯cd \u0000¯⇢u¯cu ¯⇢d¯cd ⇣ Td Tu \u0000 1 ⌘ Mu(1 +F(!)) \u0000 ⇣ Td Tu ⌘ \u0000Mu 1+ ⇣ Td Tu \u0000 1 ⌘ F(!) 5. It consists of a ’semi-analytical’ approach, since well-known analytical models are employed together with the transfer function F(!) given by the numerical simulation. The total transfer matrix in terms of p 0/¯⇢¯c and u 0 will be given by the product of the transfer matrices of the single elements. The results are shown in Fig. 5 in terms of the scattering matrix (see Eq. (5)), which is obtained from an algebraic manipulation of the transfer matrix. In Fig. 5, the model (blue line) is compared against the scattering matrix identiﬁed numerically (green-dashed line). Signiﬁcant discrepancies are found in the transmission coefﬁcients up and down stream and minor discrepancies in the low frequency region for the other terms. This means that the approximation of a concentrated heat release does not represent the heat exchanger very well. In fact, the model is qualitatively wrong, even if all the main qualitative features are present. Several hypothesis can be made to explain the discrepancies. First, the heat release is not equally distributed along the HX, but occurs for the most part at the front stagnation point and at the beginning of the duct, where the temperature gradient is higher. In addition, the presence of heat release at the front stagnation point might inﬂuence the scattering properties of the area change. Moreover, the sudden expansion downstream could also cause acoustic dissipation, due to the presence of sharp edges. 5. Conclusion In this work, the identiﬁcation of the transfer function and scattering matrix of a cold heat ex- changer in hot cross ﬂow is presented. The objective is not only to obtain a validated model for stability studies, but also to validate the effectiveness of the weakly compressible solver in handling acoustic simulation. The results show that the weakly compressible solver is apt for identifying the leading order effects, such as heat release and velocity ﬂuctuaitons for a wide range of frequencies. At higher frequencies some discrepancies arise. However, such discrepancies do not have much in- ﬂuence, since the gain is close to zero. An attempt to model the HX analytically has been made. Comparison to results from direct identiﬁcation shows that the approach used in the modeling is not satisfactory. To fully understand the mechanisms of acoustic scattering in a heat exchanger, further studies are needed on the behavior of the single acoustic elements (channel, area change) in presence of heat release. 6.

Self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities often occur in such systems. A practical way to predict the presence of the instabilities is the network model approach. In the present study, the conﬁguration ﬂame – heat exchanger is analyzed numerically. We ﬁrst analyze the system as a network of segregated elements. Based on the resulting acoustic scattering matrix, the role of the heat exchanger as an ampliﬁer of the ﬂame resonant frequencies will be discussed. Then, results from the 1 D network modeling are compared to results of compressible numerical simulations, performed for several distances between ﬂame and heat exchanger. Finally, the limits to the validity of the segregated network model approach are discussed. 1. Introduction Premixed ﬂames with cold heat exchanger in cross-ﬂow can be found in practical heat production systems, ranging from residential to industrial scale. A widely used conﬁguration consists of pin or tube heat exchangers downstream a perforated premixed burner plate. In thermoacoustic systems, heat sources are known as the main source of acoustic disturbance energy. However, little research has focused on the role of heat sinks on the system acoustics. Indeed, the presence of cold heat exchangers introduces additional complexity to the study of such systems, since the heat transfer rate of heat exchangers is also sensitive to velocity perturbations, and the presence of the heat exchanger could either damp or enhance the system instability. In the stability analysis of complex thermoacoustic systems, a widely adopted approach is the network modelling. In this framework, a combustion system is conceived as a network of segregated elements, each characterized by a set of analytical equations, which relate the downstream acoustics to upstream perturbations. The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration Figure 1: Temperature ﬁeld of the system featuring ﬂame and cold heat exchanger downstream. All dimensions are expressed in mm. Cases with varying distance d between burner deck and heat exchanger are analyzed. Here, d = 10 mm. The network approach can be as well adopted for the case investigated in the present paper, which features a heat source (ﬂame) and a heat sink (heat exchanger). However, depending on the distance between ﬂame and heat exchanger, non-acoustic interactions due to changes in mean ﬂow might occur, which could alter the acoustic scattering properties of the single elements. In particular, when the ﬂame and the heat exchanger are very close to each other, the ﬂame front might impinge on the heat exchanger tubes, altering both the combustion and the heat transfer processes. In this case, the system ﬂame - heat exchanger cannot be modeled as a network of segregated elements anymore, but should be considered as a joint system, because of the mean ﬂow interactions existing between the elements. The goal of this study is to characterise the system with ﬂame and heat exchanger from an acous- tical point of view, and understand the conditions at which the network model approach can be con- sidered valid, i.e. when the mutual inﬂuence between sink and source can be neglected. To do so, we ﬁrst identify the scattering matrices of ﬂame and heat exchanger separately by means of unsteady compressible simulations combined with system identiﬁcation (Section 2). The scattering behaviour of the total system obtained from semi-analytical network models is discussed (Section 3). In order to prove the validity of the results given by network models, we compare them to scattering matrices obtained from direct identiﬁcation of the joint system, for several distances between ﬂame and heat exchanger (Section 4). 2. Numerical details The system considered in the present study consists of a lean premixed 2 D slit ﬂame and a cold cylindrical heat exchanger downstream of the ﬂame (see Fig. 1). A similar conﬁguration is found in the previous work of Hosseini et al. The burner deck consists of a row of slits of 0.06 mm width and 1.01 mm height. The heat exchanger consists of a row of cylindrical tubes, with a diameter of 3 mm. The extension of the numerical domain in the direction normal to the ﬂow is 2 mm. The code used for the compressible simulations is A VBP, developed by CERFACS and IFP-EN 1. The temporal and spatial discretization is a second order Lax-Wendroff scheme. The unstructured mesh adopted for the direct numerical simulation has a maximum reﬁnement of 2.00 × 10−5 m in the combustion zone and 4.00 × 10−5 m in the vicinity of the heat exchanger. Imposing an acoustic Courant number of 0.07, the time step used for the computation corresponds to ∼ 1.02 × 10−8 s. At the inlet and outlet boundaries, acoustically non-reﬂecting boundary conditions are imposed, by means of the Characteristics Based State-space Boundary Conditions (CBSBC). A constant velocity and temperature boundary condition (uin = 1 m s−1, Tin = 293 K) is imposed 1 www.cerfacs.fr/4-26334-The-A VBP-code.php 2 ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration at the inlet and constant atmospheric pressure ( pout = 101 325 Pa) at the outlet. The ﬂow regime in the domain is laminar. No-slip wall boundary conditions are assumed for the burner deck and the heat exchanger surfaces. The upper and lower sides of the domain are symmetric in order to account for the presence of neighbouring ﬂames. The premixture of air and methane is assumed as homogeneous at the inlet and has an equivalence ratio of 0.08. The combustion is modelled with a two-step reaction mechanism (see ). After combustion, the ﬂow velocity and temperature reachuhot = 3.071 m s−1 and Thot = 2005.05 K, respectively. An adiabatic boundary condition is imposed on the burner deck, in order to rule out any preheat- ing of the premixture at the inlet. This assumption does not correspond to the actual experimental conditions, in which the burner deck contributes to the heat loss of the ﬂame. The heat exchanger surface is set to a constant temperature of 323 K. The choice of constant tem- perature simpliﬁes the analysis, since it rules out the mechanism of conjugate heat transfer. However, the assumption of constant temperature at the heat exchanger surface leads to lower downstream tem- perature than in experiment. For this reason, in the present simulations the heat exchange between the ﬂow and the cylinder is handled with a modiﬁed boundary condition, featuring a thermal resistance term (Rw) in the heat ﬂux equation 2: ˙q= −(Twall − Tref )/Rw, (1) where Tref is the temperature at the heat exchanger surface and Twall is the temperature of the hot ﬂuid at the wall. For high values of thermal resistance Rw, the boundary behaves adiabatically, while for values of Rw approaching zero, the boundary behaves as a quasi-isothermal wall (for Rw = 0 the boundary condition diverges). In the present analysis, the value chosen for Rw is 0.0001, which gives a good compromise between the desired physical effect and the numerical stability. Due to the heat transferred to the heat exchanger tubes, the ﬂow temperature decreases to Tout = 1318 K. It should be noted that the outlet temperature in this study is much higher than the temperature of exhaust gases in real boilers, since in this analysis only a single row of cylindrical tubes has been taken into account. 2.01 External excitation and system identiﬁcation The scattering behaviour of an element in the acoustic network is charaterized by its transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients upstream and downstream. Equation (2) relates the output signals, fd and gu, to the incoming excitation signals fu and gd via the acoustic scattering matrix SM: (fd gu ) = [ Tu→d Rd Ru Td→u ]    SM (fu gd ), (2) in which Tu→d, Td→u, Rd and Ru are the complex-valued upstream and downstream transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients of the system. f and g are the acoustic waves, related to the perturbations in velocity and pressure as: f = 1 (p′ ¯ρ¯c + u′ ) g= 1 (p′ ¯ρ¯c − u′ ), (3) where ¯ρand ¯care the mean density and mean speed of sound. In this paper, we adopt a wavelet-based broadband signal as external excitation. This type of signals ensures a constant power spectrum in the frequency range of interest (f = Hz for the present case), with low auto-correlation and zero cross-correlation. The amplitude of the excitation signals fu and gd is set to 5% with respect to the mean velocity at the inlet and outlet. Output signals fd and gu are registered at the same planes.

The output error parametric model structure has been used for the identiﬁcation of the Multi-Input Multi-Output system from the unsteady simulations. 3. Network model of segregated elements In this section, we ﬁrst simulate the ﬂame and heat exchanger separately, and then the joint system with varying distance d. In the acoustic network model approach, complex thermoacoustic systems are conceived as a network of segregated elements. This implies that the acoustic scattering behaviour of a single element does not depend on the presence of other elements in the acoustic network. In this study, the system under investigation is divided into 3 subsystems: a heat source (ﬂame), a duct of length dand a heat sink (heat exchanger), as in Fig 2. The scattering matrices of ﬂame and heat exchanger are identiﬁed separately, by means of compressible simulations. We use the single element sub-models as building-blocks for the complete acoustic network. The propagation of acoustic waves between the two elements is modelled by means of a lossless duct of length d. The varying acoustic propagation speed in the domain is accounted for in the present network model. In this section, we make use of the network model to understand how the presence of the heat exchanger - and its distance from the ﬂame - impacts on the behaviour of the whole system. For our analysis, the in-house developed state-space based toolbox ta X is used. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. The gain of the scattering matrix is represented in the logarithmic scale, in order to visualize properly the heat exchanger behaviour. The scattering matrix of the ﬂame in Fig. 3 shows a maximum at f = 255 Hz. According to Bomberg et al, the pronounced peaks in the acoustic response of the ﬂame are due to intrinsic thermo-acoustic feedback (ITA). Such feedback mechanism is due to the unsteady thermal response of the ﬂame to velocity perturbations, which generates acoustic waves travelling upstream and downstream. The upstream propagating component of these acoustic waves modulates the upstream velocity perturbations. As suggested in, the frequency at which such feedback loop exhibit resonance corresponds to the frequency at which the phase of the ﬂame transfer function ∠F(ω) reaches −π. This can be easily veriﬁed in Fig. 4. In the numerical simulation of the heat exchanger, the velocity proﬁle at the inlet is assumed as uniform, in order to exclude any mean ﬁeld effect deriving from the ﬂame. This assumption should be accounted for, in the comparison between network model and the results of the joint system, since the ﬂow ﬁeld downstream the ﬂame has a 2 D distribution, which recovers to 1 D at longer distances. Other inlet conditions such as temperature, density and mass fractions are taken from the downstream conditions of the ﬂame. Fig. 3 shows that the heat exchanger is almost acoustically transparent: the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcients upstream Ru and downstream Rd are close to zero, with a maximum of 0.02 at 800 Hz. The transmission coefﬁcient upstream Td is almost constant in the frequency range con- 4 ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration Figure 3: Gain and Phase of the scattering matrix for the heat exchanger ( HX), ﬂame ( FL), the network model with ﬂame– 10 mm duct–heat exchanger ( FL-D 10-HX) and the network model consisting of ﬂame– 50 mm duct–heat exchanger (FL-D 50-HX) Figure 4: Gain and phase of the ﬂame transfer function F(ω) = ( ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q)/(u′ in/¯uin) without heat exchanger sidered, and has a magnitude slightly below unity ( ∼ 0.09). Similarly, the magnitude of downstream transmission coefﬁcient Td is also frequency invariant and is slightly above unity (∼ 1.02). As Fig. 3 shows, the scattering matrix of the total system shows higher peaks than the ﬂame itself. These peaks are found at about 257 Hz, close to the resonant frequency of the ﬂame. In the total system the heat exchanger acts as an ampliﬁer of the intrinsic thermo-acoustic resonance. Analytically, such ampliﬁcation can be explained as follows: referring to the scattering matrix in Eq. (2), the relation between the global acoustic scattering matrix and the single subsystems is described in Eqs. (4). Terms with subscripts 1 refer to the ﬂame, and terms with subscript 2 refer to the heat exchanger. The peaks in the scattering matrix depend mainly on 1 − (R 1 d R 2 ue−2 ik L), which is the denominator of all four terms. Resonance sets in when the product between the ﬂame downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient, R 1 d and the heat exchanger upstream reﬂection coefﬁcient approach unity. In presence of a duct of length L, resonance also depends on the time lag e−ik L, where k= ω/cand cis ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 5 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration the speed of sound downstream the ﬂame front.

Away from the resonant frequency, the behaviour of the system mainly follows the ﬂame scattering properties. Moreover, the results in Fig. 3 show that the variation of the distance between ﬂame and heat exchanger does not impact signiﬁcantly on the system acoustic response. In fact, the cases d = 50 mm and d = 10 mm do not differ noticeably in the scattering matrix magnitude. The difference in phase becomes non-negligible only at higher frequencies, when the compactness is not satiﬁed anymore. In the present study, the minimum length considered for d is 8 mm. For distances lower than 8 mm, it is reasonable to question the validity of the results from the network model. As noted above, the distance is intended as between the burner deck and the center of the heat exchanger tube. In the actual system, the ﬂame is about 4 mm high and the heat exchanger has a radius of 1.05 mm. It follows that for a distance of 8 mm, the ﬂame tip is in fact only 2.05 mm away from the tube row. At shorter distances, as already shown by Hosseini et al, the presence of the heat exchanger in the nearﬁeld of the ﬂame can deeply impact on the nature of the system, which might show non-linear behaviour. 4. Identiﬁcation of the joint thermoacoustic system In order to explore the validity of the network model approach, direct numerical simulation of the joint system featuring ﬂame and heat exchanger are carried out for the case of d= 50 mm, 20 mm, 10 mmand for the \"limit case\" of d= 8 mm. The results have been compared to the scattering matrix in Fig. 3. Discrepancies arising between CFD and network model are then discussed and explained. 4.01 Case d>20 mm At a distance of 20 mm between the two elements, it is reasonable to presume that no mean ﬁeld effects exist between ﬂame and heat exchanger. The ﬂow proﬁle approaching the heat exchanger can in fact be approximated as block proﬁle, since only 0.01% deviation in the incoming velocity proﬁle is found and non-uniformities in temperature proﬁle are negligible. As shown in Fig. 5, the scattering matrix resulting from CFD gives very good agreement with respect to the network model. The gain is well resolved for all the frequencies and, in particular, the resonant peak is correctly captured for all the terms in the scattering matrix. Minor discrepancies can be found in the phase at higher frequencies, see Fig. 5. Such discrepancies mainly occur in the terms involving downstream signals and are caused by the error made in the time delay estimation of the acoustic waves propagating from the heat exchanger to the outlet reference plane, at which the signals are registered. In fact, the temperature ﬁeld downstream the heat exchanger is mainly 2 D, due to the wake after the cylindrical tubes. Indeed, the non-uniform temperature ﬁeld represents a source of error for the estimation of the speed of sound, and thus, for the phase of the total scattering matrix. 4.02 Case d<10 mm As the distance between ﬂame and heat exchanger descreases, CFD simulations show that the value of the resonant peak also decreases. In fact, results in Fig. 5 show that the scattering matrix for the cases of 10 mmduct has a resonance peak which is signiﬁcantly lower than the case of 50 mmduct. This means that the network model obtained from segregated elements is not valid anymore when 6 ICSV 23, Athens (Greece), 10-14 July 2016 The 23 rd International Congress of Sound and Vibration the distance between burner deck and heat exchanger is approximately 10 mm. The reason behind such discrepancy is the different response of the heat exchanger in presence of a 2 D distribution in the incoming velocity proﬁle. For d= 10 mm, the velocity downstream the ﬂame front presents a maximum deviation of 5% along the Y direction. Such deviation slightly changes the acoustic scattering behaviour of the heat exchanger, as shown in Fig. 6. The scattering matrices in Fig. 6 are identiﬁed directly from the compressible simulations of the joint system, and the input and output Figure 5: Gain and phase of the scattering matrix resulting from CFD of the joint system with ducts of 8 mm (CFD 08), 20 mm (CFD 20) and 50 mm (CFD 50) between ﬂame and HX, compared to the network model consisting of ﬂame – 50 mmduct – heat exchanger (FL-D 50-HX). The case with duct length of 10 mm (CFD 10) is omitted, but shows similar values as the case (CFD 08). The frequency range is restricted to Hz to better visualize the resonance peak.

Due to the high sensitivity of the system at resonant frequencies (see Eqs. (4)), the small change in heat exchanger scattering properties results in a conspicuous decrease of the peak response. 5. Conclusions In the present study, we analyzed and discussed the acoustic scattering behaviour of a thermoa- coustic system consisting of a 2 D slit premixed ﬂame and a cylindrical heat exchanger. A resonance peak is found in the scattering matrix of the ﬂame, due to the intrinsic feedback mechanism. Both re- sults from CFD-system identiﬁcation and network model show that the presence of the heat exchanger downstream the ﬂame ampliﬁes the resonance around the same frequency. Comparison between CFD and network modeling shows that the peak in acoustic response of the system can be correcty cap- tured by the network model for the case of d=50 mm, and in general, when the mean ﬂow effects due to the short distance between the elements are negligible. When the distance between heat source and heat sink decreases, 2 D mean ﬂow effects on the heat exchanger scattering behaviour cannot be neglected anymore. CFD results for the case of d=10 mmand d= 8 mm show that the resonance peak in the scattering matrix decreases considerably and that the predictions given by the network model are no longer accurate. The next step is to analyze the role of the heat exchanger on the system stabil- ity, and understand how the heat exchanger scattering behaviour changes in presence of non-uniform velocity proﬁles. Moreover, a study of the acoustic behaviour of the system in presence of realis- tic experimental boundary conditions (heat loss at combustor walls, conjugate heat transfer) is also needed. 6.

The full system is partitioned into a network of interconnected subsystems. Each of the subsystems can be modeled independently with adequate complexity. In particular, linearized models have proven to predict the propagation of acoustic perturbations very well in many cases. There have been a lot of different model structures associated with the individual methods to retrieve linear acoustic models. Analytical derivations typically involved time delays, linearized PDEs used to be evaluated in frequency domain directly inside of the FEM software and LES system identiﬁ- cation resulted in discrete time ﬁlters. We have adapted and developed a framework called ta X which uniﬁes all types of linear acoustic models based on linear system theory and state space modeling. Besides providing a standardized basis for linear acoustic models, there is a generic interconnection algorithm for state space network models. It evaluates the interconnections be- tween the subsystem models and results in one joint linear state space model. Consequently, eigenvalues of the connected system can be computed by solving a standard or generalized linear eigenvalue problem. This leads especially for large systems to a tremendous speed im- provement over the classical multiplicative coupling in frequency domain. In the latter case, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem needed to be solved instead. A continuous time linear state space system is stable, if the real parts of all eigenvalues are less than zero. Consequently, it is easy to determine the stability of a linear acoustic network model if it is modeled by state space systems. But the eigenvalues of a network model can only be computed, if all subsystem models are fully speciﬁed. In complex systems such as gas turbines it would be favorable to draw conclusions about the stability just by investigating isolated parts of the system. It is of interest to provide a stability criterion which helps to discriminate between burners which are more or less prone to instability. Such a criterion is given by the instability potentiality, which is based on sound power ampliﬁcation and corresponding to the small gain theorem. Common perception was that instability in thermoacoustic systems happens due to acoustic eigenmodes becoming unstable. This idea is based on the assumption that the ampliﬁcation of acoustic cavity modes by the ﬂame may exceed the damping by acoustic losses inside the device and at the boundaries. But recently it was discovered that thermoacoustic systems with velocity sensitive ﬂames may exhibit unstable eigenmodes even if non reﬂective boundary conditions enforce that no cavity modes exist. Those intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) modes are caused by an intrinsic feedback: Heat release ﬂuctuations of the ﬂame act as a volume source and generate upstream traveling acoustic waves. Those acoustic waves in turn cause a velocity perturbation at the burner mouth, which excites the ﬂame dynamics. Therefore, these ITA modes are distinct from the acoustic modes of the system and they also exist in full gas burner test rigs with iii reﬂective boundaries. The thorough investigation of the interconnection of state space models for acoustics and ﬂame allows to identify and discriminate between ITA and acoustic cavity modes of a full system. This paradigm shift in the interpretation of thermoacoustic instability brings an explanation for apparently paradox behavior such as the destabilization of a combustor test rig by raising the acoustic losses at the downstream end using a perforated plate. iv Kurzfassung Ein Weg zur Beherrschung der Komplexität in thermo-akustischen Systemen ist die Netzw- erk Modellierung. Das Gesamtsystem wird in miteinander verbundene Teilsysteme aufgeteilt. Jedes Teilsystem kann mit der jeweils lokal notwendigen Komplexität modelliert werden. Dabei haben sich speziell linearisierte Modelle als gut geeignet erwiesen um die akustische Wellenaus- breitung abzubilden. In Abhängigkeit der unterschiedlichen Methoden um lineare akustische Modelle zu gewinnen, gab es eine Vielzahl verschiedener Modellstrukturen. Analytische Her- leitungen münden typischer Weise in Zeitverzügen, lineariserte partielle Differentialgleichun- gen wurden direkt in der FEM Software im Frequenzbereich ausgewertet und LES in Kom- bination mit System Identiﬁkationsalgorithmen resultiert in zeitdiskreten Filtern. Aufbauend auf linearer System Theorie und Zustandsraum Modellen haben wir eine Werkzeugsammlung namens ta X entwickelt, die eine vereinheitlichte Modellierung erlaubt. Neben der standard- isierten Basis für lineare akustische Modelle, gibt es einen generischen Verbindungsalgorith- mus für Zustandsraum Modelle. Dieser wertet die Verbindungen zwischen den Teilsystemen aus und liefert als Ergebnis ein zusammengefasstes lineares Zustandsraum Modell zurück. Fol- glich können die Eigenwerte des verbundenen Gesamtsystems durch die Lösung eines linearen Eigenwert Problems bestimmt werden. Speziell für große Systeme ist diese V orgehensweise um viele Größenordnungen efﬁzienter als die herkömmliche multiplikative Kopplung im Frequen- zraum. In letzterem Fall muss stattdessen ein nichtlineares Eigenwert Problem gelöst werden. Ein zeitkontinuierliches lineares Zustandsraum Modell ist stabil, wenn die Realteile aller Eigen- werte negativ sind. Dementsprechend ist es einfach die Stabilität von linearen akustischen Net- zwerk Modellen zu bestimmen, sofern sie als Zustandstraum Modell vorliegen. Allerdings funk- tioniert das nur, wenn alle Teilsysteme des Netzwerk Modelles vollständig deﬁniert vorliegen. In komplexen Systemen, wie Gas Turbinen ist es vorteilhaft, wenn man in der Lage ist Schlüsse über die Stabilität von einzelnen Teilsystemen zu ziehen, ohne das Gesamtsystem komplett zu berücksichtigen. Es ist hoch Interessant ein Stabilitätskriterium zu ﬁnden, das eine Unterschei- dung zwischen Brennern zu lässt, die mehr oder weniger stark zu Instabilität neigen. Solch ein Kriterium wird durch die \"Instability Potentiality\"gegeben, welche auf akustischer Leis- tungsverstärkung basiert und dem Small Gain Theorem entspricht. Die herkömmliche These war, dass Instabilität von themoakustischen Systemen allein durch in- stabile akustische Eigenmoden verursacht wird. Dieses Konzept basiert auf der Annahme, dass die Verstärkung von akustischen Moden durch die Flamme größer sein kann als die Dämpfung durch akustische Verluste im Inneren der Maschine und an den Rändern. V or kurzem wurde entdeckt, dass thermoakustische Systeme mit geschwindigkeits sensitiven Flammen auch dann Eigenmoden besitzen, wenn das System durch nicht reﬂektierende Ränder gar keine akustischen Moden hat. Diese intrinsischen thermo-akustischen (ITA) Moden werden durch eine intrinsis- v che Rückkopplung verursacht: Wärmefreisetzungsschwankungen der Flamme wirken wie eine V olumen Quelle und erzeugen stromauf propagierende Schallwellen. Diese Schallwellen erzeu- gen ihrerseits eine Geschwindigkeitsstörung am Brenner Auslass, die die Flammendynamik an- regt. Folglich sind ITA Moden phänomenologisch von akustischen Moden verschieden und sie existieren auch in echten Gas Brenner Testständen mit reﬂektierenden Rändern. Die präzise Un- tersuchung der Verbindung der Zustandsraum Modelle für die Akustik und die Flamme erlaubt eine klare Unterscheidung zwischen ITA und akustischen Moden eines kompletten Systems. Dieser Paradigmenwechsel in der Interpretation von thermoakustischer Instabilität erlaubt eine Erklärung für scheinbar paradoxe Situationen wie die Destabilisierung eines Brenner Versuchs- standes durch die Erhöhung akustischer Verluste mit einer perforierten Platte als Terminierung. iii iv Contents 1 Introduction 1 2 Thermoacoustic Network Modeling 5 2.01 Interface Design. 5 2.01.01 Higher Order Frequency Domain Coupling. 6 2.01.02 Universal Higher Order Coupling. 7 2.02 Linear Subsystem Models. 8 2.02.01 General Properties of Linear Models. 8 2.02.02 Polynomial Transfer Function Models. 9 2.02.03 State Space Models. 9 2.03 Methods to Retrieve Linear Acoustic and Thermoacoustic Models. 10 2.03.01 1 D Duct Acoustic. 10 2.03.01.01 Analytical Solution. 12 2.03.01.02 Padé Approximation. 12 2.03.01.03 Spatially Discretized State Space System. 12 2.03.02 Simplistic n- τ Flame Models. 13 2.03.03 2 D/3 D Spatially Discretized Linearized PDEs. 14 2.03.03.01 Evaluation of Impedances. 15 2.03.03.02 State Space from Modal Reduction. 15 2.03.03.03 Direct State Space Export. 15 2.03.04 System Identiﬁcation from LES or Experiment Time Series Data. 16 2.04 Interconnection. 16 2.04.01 Frequency Domain Interconnection. 16 2.04.02 Universal State Space Interconnection. 18 2.04.02.01 Interconnection of State Space Models. 18 2.04.02.02 SS Interconnection Minimal Example. 19 2.05 Stability of Thermoacoustic Systems. 21 2.05.01 Classical Frequency Domain Model Solver. 21 2.05.02 State Space Model Eigenvalue Solver. 22 3 Sound Power Ampliﬁcation and Acoustic Energy of Thermoacoustic Systems 23 3.01 Nonlinear Stability. 23 3.02 Instability Potentiality and Small Gain Theorem. 24 4 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames 29 4.01 Low Order Combustor Test Rig Network Model. 29 4.01.01 Boundary Subsystem. 31 v CONTENTS 4.01.02 Flame Subsystem. 32 4.01.03 Burner Subsystem. 32 4.01.04 Full BRS System. 33 4.02 BRS Model Disassembly and Reassembly. 34 4.02.01 Acoustic System. 34 4.02.02 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Burner & Flame System. 35 4.02.03 Modulated Coupling of Burner & Flame and Acoustic System. 37 4.03 Numerical Results. 38 4.03.01 Correspondence of Eigenvalues. 38 4.03.02 Comparison of Mode Shapes. 39 4.03.03 Sensitivity of Eigenvalues to Downstream Reﬂection Coefﬁcient. 40 4.04 Conclusion. 41 5 Summary of Achievements 43 5.01 Linear State Space Network Modeling of Acoustic Systems. 44 5.02 Hybrid CFD/low-order modeling of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations. 44 5.03 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames. 45 5.04 Acoustic and Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes of a Premixed Combustor. 46 6 Outlook 47 Appendix Reproduction of Papers 59.1 Linear State Space Network Modeling of Acoustic Systems. 59.2 Hybrid CFD/low-order modeling of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations. 69.3 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames. 77.4 Acoustic and Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes of a Premixed Combustor. 88 vi 1 Introduction Prediction and optimization of thermoacoustic stability is important in many applications as diverse as domestic heaters, gas turbines or rocket engines. Thermoacoustic instability may oc- cur, when acoustic perturbations in a system are ampliﬁed. The resulting elevated amplitudes of pressure and velocity oscillations increase wear and emissions and may ultimately even destroy a system. For instance, liners of gas turbines may break and combustor face plates may melt as shown in Fig. 1.01. In rocket engines, thermoacoustic instability may even destroy the en- tire device. In order to avoid thermoacoustic instability, the operational range of systems needs to be restrained. For example in lean premixed combustion gas turbines, thermoacoustic reso- nances enforce a trade off between low N 0 x emissions and the tolerable sound pressure level. Thus, there is a large interest to develop tools to efﬁciently simulate and predict the dynamics of thermoacoustic systems and to enhance the understanding of the causes for thermoacoustic instability. Modeling and simulation of thermoacoustic systems is typically very hard and computationally expensive for two reasons. The ﬁrst issue is that multi scale processes are involved in the gener- ation and propagation of acoustic waves. On the one hand, acoustic ﬂow noise is often generated by turbulence or combustion, which are very small scale phenomena. On the other hand, acous- tic waves are weakly damped as they propagate in conﬁned systems and therefore interactions within large domains like entire HV AC systems or gas turbines need to be taken into account. The second issue is that thermoacoustic systems may require multi physics simulations. This is the case if combustion is involved. For instance in gas turbines or rocket engines, acoustic waves can interact with the combustion process, which may cause thermoacoustic instabilities. Even though multi scale and multi physics phenomena may be involved in some parts of a thermoacoustic system, the propagation of acoustic waves typically remains linear in most other parts. Therefore it is of interest not to model the entire thermoacoustic system with one single 1 Reproduced with kind permission of Prof. Sikke Klein Figure 1.01: Damages of a gas turbine liner (left) and combustor face plate (right) due to ther- moacoustic instability.1 Introduction Figure 1.02: Trade off between NOx emissions and lean blow out (LBO) due to thermoacoustic oscillations. type of model that captures all possible effects, but rather to subdivide the system into a network of interconnected subsystems. Each subsystem, can then be modeled with suitable complexity and the interconnected model is supposed to retrieve the overall thermoacoustic dynamics. The manuscript is structured as follows: At ﬁrst an introduction to thermoacoustic network modeling is presented. Special emphasis is put on the difference between classical frequency domain methods and newer state space modeling approaches. Due to the identity of frequency and time domain in state space models, we can easily determine the stability of such systems. In order to do so, an algorithm to connect two linear state space systems, which retrieves one joint state space system is presented and explained. This procedure has the huge advantage, that linear eigenvalue problems can be solved to determine the stability of thermoacoustic net- work models. The classical frequency domain approaches need to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, which is much less computationally efﬁcient. Furthermore, the network models can be simulated in time and used as a boundary condition for LES simulations. By doing so, the acoustic environment of an entire combustion test rig can be simulated jointly with a nonlinear high ﬁdelity combustion simulation at reasonable computational costs. Subsequently acoustic energy and sound power based stability criteria are elaborated. There is a stability criterion called\"instability potentiality\"respectively\"whistling potential\". It can be linked to a system theoretic method called the small gain theorem. Unfortunately, the criterion does not directly prove to be useful for stability investigations on premixed ﬂames, because it is very conservative and over predicts instability. However, it may be used to identify burner conﬁgurations, which minimize sound power ampliﬁcation. Finally the dynamics of premixed combustion systems are investigated. It is shown, that an intrinsic feedback between ﬂame and burner causes intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) eigenmodes of full combustion test rig systems, which are clearly distinct from acoustic cavity modes of the system. This has several important implications for the theory of thermoacoustic combustion instability. First of all, thermoacoustic combustion systems possess more eigenmodes than just the acoustic cavity modes. When thermoacoustic instability occurs, it does not necessarily need to be an acoustic mode which becomes unstable due to the driving of the ﬂame, as traditional theories assume. It may just as well be an ITA eigenmode, which becomes unstable due to the coupling with the acoustic boundaries. The theory of ITA eigenmodes in combustion systems explains seemingly paradox phenomena such as the destabilization of a combustion test rig by applying a dissipative perforated plate termination. A summary of achievements condenses the contributions of the author to the respective devel- opments and publications. Eventually the outlook presents potentials for further development in the pursuit of providing better tools for the modeling of thermoacoustic systems. Introduction 2 Thermoacoustic Network Modeling Thermoacoustic network modeling is a state of the art technique to model the thermoacoustic dynamics of large conﬁned systems. It is based on a subdivision of a system into interconnected subsystems, which locally model the generation and propagation of acoustic perturbations. Interfaces need to be deﬁned, where the system is split into subsystem models. Subsequently the subsystem models are connected by an interconnection algorithm. The resulting aggregated thermoacoustic network model can for example be solved for frequency responses, and their linear stability properties can be determined. There are two modeling paradigms for the interfaces and the connection of subsystem models. The ﬁrst one is simply an averaged balance of the acoustic state on the interface. As it does not presume the wave number vector or the frequency of the modes involved, it naturally ties into time and frequency domain investigations [4–6]. The second one is the classical frequency domain network modeling, which presumes the structure of the wave number vector on the in- terface and the complex frequency of oscillation [7–10]. Depending on the modeling paradigm, the interconnection of the systems is different and the resulting interconnected system is differ- ent as well. This has important implications especially for the efﬁciency of the computation of eigenmodes. Subsequently, the interface and interconnection design is presented. The differences between higher order frequency domain and universal coupling are discussed. A brief introduction to linear models in general is given, followed by a section, which presents methods to retrieve such models of acoustic and thermoacoustic systems. In the context of network modeling, the interconnection algorithm is a key technology. Therefore, the state space interconnection algo- rithm is presented and differences to the classical frequency domain methods are emphasized. The nature of the model, state space or classical frequency domain, determines how the system is solved. Thus we discuss implications for the efﬁciency of the computation of eigenvalues. 2.01 Interface Design The process of subdividing the system raises the need for well deﬁned interfaces between sub- systems. There is a distinction between planar wave and so called higher order mode interfaces. Plane wave interfaces presume that the wave propagation on the interface is one dimensional. This condition is necessarily valid, if the smallest acoustic wave length involved is larger than the diameter D of the interface. This corresponds to acoustically compact interfaces: He = (D f)/c ≪ 1. In different words, if the maximum frequency of interest is less than the cut on frequency of a duct section with the cross section of the respective interface, there are Thermoacoustic Network Modeling Figure 2.01: Plane wave interface between subsystems u and d. just plane waves propagating. The averaged acoustic state variables across the interface are u′ u = u′ d; p′ u = p′ d, (2.01) where u′, p′ are the axial acoustic velocity and pressure oscillations and the subscripts u,d de- note the up and downstream system at the respective interface. A different set of state variables are expressed by Riemann invariants f = (p′/(ρc) +u′)/2; g = (p′/(ρc) −u′)/2, (2.02) of the linearized Euler equations. The resulting coupling condition is fu = fd; gu = gd, (2.03) as shown in Fig. 2.01. For planar waves, the simple coupling of the state at the interface and the classical frequency domain network method result in the same equations. The term higher order modes relates to the mode shapes of a duct section above cut on but here we generalize it and use the expression to charactarize any non-planar wave interface. For non-planar waves, there is a difference between the simple coupling of averaged states on the plane and the classical frequency domain method. 2.01.01 Higher Order Frequency Domain Coupling The classical way to realize a thermoacoustic network simulation code is to couple the individ- ual subsystems in frequency domain by evaluating the frequency response of the subsystem at the given frequency. The corresponding waves traveling in the same direction on both sides of the interface between two connected annular subsystems must have the same wave number vec- tor. This wave number vector consists of an axial and an azimuthal component as depicted in Fig. 2.02. There is a symmetry condition in azimuthal direction imposed: kφ = ±m,m = 1, 2, 3, (2.04) This restricts the azimuthal wave number to be real and discrete on the interface. The axial wave number component is a function of the frequency: kx± = k 1 −M 2  −M ± √ 1 − (kφ Rk )2 (1 −M 2)   (2.05) with k = ω/c and R the middle radius of the annulus. There are several issues with this deﬁnition: 2.01 Interface Design Figure 2.02: Higher order annular acoustic subsystem interface with wave number vector cou- pling. Figure 2.03: Higher order acoustic subsystem interface with mass, momentum, species and en- ergy coupling. • The symmetry condition is justiﬁed for modes shapes of marginally stable, neither grow- ing nor decaying, azimuthal eigenmodes in annular duct sections. However the direction of propagation of the acoustic wave fronts in principal axis k is not orthogonal to the surface of the interface. Therefore, the symmetry condition does not necessarily hold in the case of growth or decay of a mode or transient time domain simulation. • The second shortcoming is that the interface relies on kx±, which is a function of ω. Therefore, it is not possible to construct subsystem models with constant coefﬁcients independent of ω such as state space models. This implies, that eigenvalues of such a system cannot be obtained by solving a standard linear eigenvalue problem. • Depending on the investigated frequency range and problem, it is possible that multiple azimuthal wave numbers need to be considered. This makes the handling complicated, as it is difﬁcult to determine the maximum order of m. 2.01.02 Universal Higher Order Coupling Instead of presuming the mode shape on the higher order interface, it is possible to divide it into patches and to couple the averaged acoustic (and species if applicable) state variables as depicted in Fig. 2.03. The number of the patches can be increased up to the point, where the coupling is on a cell by cell basis between the domains of the subsystems. This procedure would be similar to aero acoustic solvers, which couple a solid body and its oscillations with a system of linearized PDEs for the acoustic propagation. Thermoacoustic Network Modeling 2.02 Linear Subsystem Models Having chosen a decomposition of a thermoacoustic system with plane wave or universal in- terfaces, linear subsystem models for the parts of a linear network model can be deﬁned. For simplicity, the derivation is limited to plane wave interfaces. In this case, the models are in- dependent of the different interface and interconnection modeling paradigms introduced in the previous section. At ﬁrst an introduction to linear dynamic models and system theory is given. Subsequently, several procedures for retrieving such models from acoustic systems are pre- sented. Eventually, the interconnection of subsystems is presented for both, the classical fre- quency domain and the state space systems. 2.02.01 General Properties of Linear Models A linear dynamic model f (function not the acoustic wave) relates some input time series u(t) with an output y(t). Typical inputs are incident acoustic Riemann invariants f, g also called characteristic wave amplitudes (CW A) or acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations. Outputs may be emit- ted CW A or pressure ﬂuctuations. The most general expression for such a model is given by the convolution of the input with the impulse response function G(τ), also known as Green’s function, of the model f: y(t) = f(u(t)) =G(τ) ⋆u(t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ G(τ)u(t −τ)dτ. (2.06) The past values of the input time series are convolved with the impulse response function G. If the system is causal, the output y(t) only depends on past inputs u(t − τ;τ ≥ 0) and the convolution reduces to y(t) = ∫ ∞ G(τ)u(t −τ)dτ. (2.07) The convolution integral is linear as it satisﬁes additivity (superposition) f(u 1 +u 2) = f(u 1) +f(u 2) (2.08) and homogeneity of degree 1 f(au(t)) = af(u(t)). (2.09) The Laplace transform is deﬁned to be L{f(t)} = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t)e−st dt = F(s). (2.010) We use the deﬁnition s = jω+σ of the Laplace variable, where ω is the angular frequency and σ is the growth rate. In the Laplace domain, the convolution becomes a multiplication of the Laplace transformed input and output time series and the so calledtransfer function G(s), which is the Laplace transform of the Green’s function: L{y(t)} = y(s) = L{G(τ) ⋆u(t))} = L{G(τ)} ·L{u(t))} =G(s) ·u(s). (2.011) Commonly, linear systems are examined using impulse, step and frequency responses. The frequency response of a linear model is retrieved by evaluating the transfer function at a set of 2.02 Linear Subsystem Models discrete frequencies ω. Similar, the impulse response is computed from evaluating the impulse response function at a set of delays τ. However it is important to notice, that the responses of a linear system characterize properties of the corresponding linear model. Usually, they are not linear models by themselves. 2.02.02 Polynomial Transfer Function Models There is a large class of linear dynamic models, which may be described by a linear differential equation in time b 0 y(t) +b 1 ˙y(t) +b 2 ¨y(t) +. +bm dm y(t) dm t = a 0 u(t) +a 1 ˙u(t) +a 2 ¨u(t) +. +an dnu(t) dn t, (2.012) The transfer function of such models can easily be determined by applying Laplace transform into frequency domain, where the model is expressed by a rational polynomial in s G(s) = a 0 +a 1 s +a 2 s 2 +. +an sn b 0 +b 1 s +b 2 s 2 +. +bm sm. (2.013) Subsequently, the input output relation is solved by integration of the convolution equation (2.07) using the inverse Laplace transformation of the transfer function to obtain the corresponding Green’s function. 2.02.03 State Space Models There is a generalization of polynomial transfer function models by so called state space mod- els. Instead of modeling systems with one dimensional rational polynomials of high order, it is possible to represent the same dynamics with a high dimensional system of equations of ﬁrst order: E ˙x = Ax +Bu (2.014) y =C x+Du where x is the state vector and ABCDE are the system matrices with constant coefﬁcients. B relates the inputs to the time derivative of the state and C maps the state on the ouputs. The so called feedthrough matrix D directly links inputs u and outputs y, as it typically happens in acoustically compact subsystems. The dynamics of the model are given by A and E. Depending on the source of the model (see section 2.03), the state vector x may or may not have an explicit physical signiﬁcation like a pressure distribution inside the subsystem. The transfer function G(s) of every state space model can be determined uniquely by Laplace transform. It is given by a rational polynomial in s y(s) = (C(Es − A)−1 B +D)   G(s) u(s). (2.015) Thermoacoustic Network Modeling The opposite translation from a polynomial transfer function to a state space model exists as well, but it is not unique. One generic way to achieve such a translation is given by the control- lable canonical form : ˙x =   0 1. 0 1 −a 0 −a 1. −am−1  x +  .  u (2.016) y = [ b 0−bn a 0, b 1−bn a 1, bn−1−bn am−1 ] x +bnu. In the derivations shown above just single input, single output (SISO) systems are considered. However, the extension to multiple input, multiple output systems (MIMO) is straight forward and will be used in the following without further notice. Then the inputs u and outputs y are vectors instead of scalars and B,C,D are matrices instead of vectors or scalars. 2.03 Methods to Retrieve Linear Acoustic and Thermoacous- tic Models The purpose of linear thermoacoustic network modeling is to cope with the different levels of complexity in distinct parts of the corresponding system. By dividing the system into intercon- nected parts, each subsystem can then be modeled by a modeling procedure that is as simple as possible, while capturing the relevant effects. In the following sections, models retrieved from 1 D duct acoustics, n −τ ﬂame models, 2 d/3 D linearized PDEs and system identiﬁcation are brieﬂy discussed. Most emphasis is put on the 1 D models as they provide the most valuable insights without adding superﬂuous complexity. 2.03.01 1 D Duct Acoustic In a homogeneous perfect gas, the propagation of acoustic waves can be modeled by an isentropic compression. In the simplest case of a thermoacoustic system, there is one di- mensional wave propagation. Analytical solutions exist for a variety of acoustically compact (He = f d/c ≪ 1) elements, such as area or temperature discontinuities and for duct sections. Assuming a ﬂuid at rest, the one dimensional propagation of acoustic waves in a duct section is described by the linearized continuity and momentum equation : ∂ ∂t [p′ ¯ρc u′ ] = [ 0 −c ∂ ∂x −c ∂ ∂x 0 ][p′ ¯ρc u′ ] (2.017) The linear system of differential equations is not diagonal and therefore, the two equations are coupled. In order to transform the system to diagonal form, Laplace transformation is applied: s [p′ ¯ρc u′ ] = [ 0 −c ∂ ∂x −c ∂ ∂x 0 ][p′ ¯ρc u′ ] (2.018) 2.03 Methods to Retrieve Linear Acoustic and Thermoacoustic Models fu fd 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 2.04: Discretized duct section. and then the system of equations is solved for its eigenvalues det [ s −c ∂ ∂x −c ∂ ∂x s ] = 0; s 1,2 = ±c ∂ ∂x (2.019) and eigenvectors, also called Riemann invariants, of the differential operator are found by sub- stituting s 1,2: c ∂ ∂x [−1 −1 −1 −1 ][p′ ¯ρc u′ ] ⇒ (p′ ¯ρc +u′ ) ≡ 2 f (2.020) c ∂ ∂x [ 1 −1 −1 1 ][p′ ¯ρc u′ ] ⇒ (p′ ¯ρc −u′ ) ≡ 2 g. (2.021) Thus there is a transformation to generalized coordinates [p′ ¯ρc u′ ] = [1 1 1 −1 ][f g ]. (2.022) The system of differential equations is subsequently transformed to generalized coordinates: ∂ ∂t [1 1 1 −1 ][f g ] = [ 0 −c ∂ ∂x −c ∂ ∂x 0 ][1 1 1 −1 ][f g ] (2.023) ∂ ∂t [f g ] = [1 2 −1 ][ 0 −c ∂ ∂x −c ∂ ∂x 0 ][1 1 1 −1 ][f g ] (2.024) ∂ ∂t [f g ] = [−c ∂ ∂x 0 0 c ∂ ∂x ][f g ]. (2.025) Thus the propagation of acoustic waves in ducts can be expressed by two independent advection equations: ∂f ∂t = −c ∂f ∂x; ∂g ∂t = c ∂g ∂x (2.026) Solutions for the f -wave are of the form f (x, t) = f (t −x/c). With boundary condition f |x=0 = fu and output deﬁnition f |x=l = fd as shown in Fig. 2.04. Thermoacoustic Network Modeling 2.03.01.01 Analytical Solution The analytic solution for the propagation of acoustic waves through a duct section of length l is: fd = fu(t −l/c). (2.027) In analogy the solution for g-waves is: gu = gd (t −l/c). (2.028) Thus the incident waves leave the duct section after a delay τ = l/c. In Laplace domain, the solution is given by the classical result of the scattering matrix of a duct section: [gu(s) fd (s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ e−sτ 0 ]    G(s) [fu(s) gd (s) ] (2.029) This scattering matrix can be interpreted as a matrix of transfer functions G(s). Unfortunately the exact solution in Laplace domain is a harmonic function of the frequency s = jω+σ. As there exist very efﬁcient solvers for algebraic eigenvalue problems (see 2.05), it is of interest to approximate the exact solution of the delay either directly by a state space system or by a polynomial, which may subsequently be converted to a state space system. 2.03.01.02 Padé Approximation It is possible to develop a series expansion of the exponential expression in the delay transfer functions. This method results in a rational polynomial in s and is called Padé approximation. For instance, the polynomial transfer function of order 2 in numerator and denominator is: e−sτ ≈ 1 − τ 2 s + τ2 12 s 2 1 + τ 2 s + τ2 12 s 2. (2.030) This transfer function can be translated to matrix representation as shown in section 2.02.03. Un- fortunately, the resulting transfer function tends to become unstable with increasing order of approximation. The Matlab manual of Padé approximation suggests not to go beyond an order of 9. This effectively limits the application of the Padé approximation, to nondimensionalized delays τω < 3. 2.03.01.03 Spatially Discretized State Space System Instead of solving the differential equation (2.026) analytically, it is possible to spatially dis- cretize the duct as shown in Fig. 2.04 and to directly aim for a state space system. Previous works of Mangesius et al and Blumenthal used to discretize in space and time, whereas here, we remain continuous time. Using a ﬁrst order upwind ﬁnite difference scheme: dfj dt = −c fj − fj−1 ∆x.

We choose a resolution ∆x = L/4 and deﬁne a short hand a ≡ c/∆x. By those deﬁnitions, the state space system (2.014) which models the f -wave duct dynamics is: d dt   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  =   −a 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 a −a     f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  +   a   [ fu ] (2.032) [ fd ] = [ 0 0 0 1 ] x + [ ] fu. The state space system of the g-waves is retrieved accordingly. By choosing higher order integration schemes e.g. third order upwind and by using a higher resolution, The precision of the state space model can be increased. Typically a resolution of 10 points per wavelength for both f and g is a reasonable choice to achieve high accuracy. Therefore the order of the duct model should be chosen N/2 = 10τωmax. Fig. 2.05 shows how well the model is performing compared to the analytical solution. 2.03.02 Simplistic n- τ Flame Models There is a widely used low order ﬂame model in thermoacoustic systems called then −τ ﬂame. It presumes, that the ﬂame reacts to a velocity perturbationu′ at the burner mouth with a delayed heat release ﬂuctuation ˙Q′. The input u′ at a time t −τ is multiplied by a ﬁxed value n to result in the output ˙Q′(t): ˙Q′(t) = nu′(t −τ)  = ∫ τ nδ(θ −τ)   G(τ) u′(t −θ)dθ  .

(2.034) Similar to the 1 D wave propagation in ducts in the previous section 2.03.01, it would be possible to use Padé approximation on the exact solution. However, it is better to directly retrieve a state space model due to the limitations of the Padé approximation discussed above. It is possible to express the delay by an advection equation: ∂x ∂t + ∂x ∂θ = 0. (2.035) The artiﬁcial state x of the delayed input signal is transported at speed 1 along θ = 0.τ with inlet boundary condition x(t)|θ=0 = u′(t). The downstream boundary is the output u′(t −τ) = x(t)|θ=τ. Subsequently θ is discretized, e.g. ∆θ = τ/4 as shown in Fig. 2.06, with a ﬁrst order upwind scheme: dxj dt = xj −xj−1 ∆θ. (2.036) The full n −τ model eventually is described by a system of ODEs with input x 1 = u (= u′) and output deﬁnition ( ˙Q′ =) y = nx 5 d dt   x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5  =   4/τ 0 0 0 −4/τ 4/τ 0 0 0 −4/τ 4/τ 0 0 0 −4/τ 4/τ     x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5  +   −4/τ  u (2.037) y = [ 0 0 0 n ] x + [ ] u. It is possible to use a second or third order upwind scheme to discretize the differential equation, which improves the accuracy (2.035). Additionally, the resolution may be increased, which also raises the accuracy of the delay approximation. A good approximation is obtained, if a delayed input wave is discretized by a third order upwind scheme and a resolution of 10 points: N = 10ωτ. In contrast to Padé approximation, there are no stability issues with increasing order, because the state space system is well conditioned. 2.03.03 2 D/3 D Spatially Discretized Linearized PDEs If the geometry of the subsystem is more complicated, but the acoustic waves do not affect the mean ﬂow, linearized partial differential equations (PDEs) can be used to account for the 2.03 Methods to Retrieve Linear Acoustic and Thermoacoustic Models wave propagation. Such PDEs are given for instance by the Helmholtz, linearized Euler and linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Models can effectively be retrieved using ﬁnite element method (FEM) tools like Comsol Multiphysics or Free FEM. The geometry of the system, the mean ﬂow, the mesh used for the discretization and the discretization scheme need to be speciﬁed. Standard FEM schemes are not well suited to solve advection diffusion problems as given by linearized ﬂow equations. The resulting models are not asymptotically stable and possess un- stable unphysical eigenmodes. It is possible to improve such schemes by stream line diffusion or Galerkin least squares stabilization methods, but this comes at the price of an arbitrary sta- bilization parameter. The speciﬁcation of this parameter is critical as it considerably inﬂuences the results and there is no generic method to estimate a good value. In contrast to that, discon- tinuous Galerkin FEM and ﬁnite V olume methods are not subject to those issues. Discontinuous Galerkin methods invoke an up winding parameter as well, but the result is insensitive to the ex- act value. It follows that for modeling acoustic systems, discontinuous Galerkin FEM methods are superior to standard FEM. In order to couple the FEM model with a thermoacoustic network code, there are two classical and one new method to be presented in the following sections. 2.03.03.01 Evaluation of Impedances It is possible to solve the linearized PDE model inside the FEM software and to couple the resulting impedances with the network code in frequency domain. This procedure is very inefﬁcient, as in every iteration of any computation the entire FEM model needs to be solved. 2.03.03.02 State Space from Modal Reduction The next method is to extract a reduced order state space system from the FEM model using a modal reduction approach. The eigenmodes of the FEM Model are computed inside the FEM software and a state space model is constructed based on the modes. This method is computationally very efﬁcient, but it comes at the price of the modal reduction. Depending on the system, the eigenmodes may or may not be good Ansatz functions to model the transmission of acoustic waves through a system. Additionally, modal reduction does not converge with increasing order. 2.03.03.03 Direct State Space Export Eventually a linear state space model as given in Eq. (2.014) is directly retrieved by exporting the system matrices from the FEM software as shown by Meindl et al. Inside the subsystem domain, 3 D wave propagation may occur, whereas the interfaces remain acoustically compact and plane. Thermoacoustic Network Modeling R 1 fi gi D 1 D 2 gu gd fu fd R 2 Figure 2.07: Interconnection of two duct sections and two reﬂective ends. Following the direct export of the state space system, instead of modal reduction, any suitable model order reduction algorithm may be applied to the system. The system matrices of models resulting from linearized PDEs are very sparse. In order to take advantage of the sparsity, we have reimplemented the functionality of matlab control system toolbox, which relies on full matrices. The resulting sparse state space (sss) custom toolbox is developed in a cooperation with the Lehrstuhl für Regelungstechnik at TUM. 2.03.04 System Identiﬁcation from LES or Experiment Time Series Data Eventually, if there is strong bidirectional interaction between acoustic waves and mean ﬂow like in the case of domains where combustion takes place, nonlinear LES simulations or even experiments need to be carried out. The system is excited with acoustic waves from the up- and downstream section and time series of the incident and emitted plane waves are measured. In experiments this measurement is achieved using the multi microphone method, whereas in CFD the plane waves can be extracted by averaging across planes in the simulation domain. Linearized models for the scattering of acoustic waves in the domain may be retrieved from the input, output time series and system identiﬁcation techniques [24–28]. 2.04 Interconnection Thermoacoustic network models are constituted by a set of interconnected subsystems. In or- der to solve for the properties of the underlying full system, the interconnections between the subsystems need to be evaluated. As already introduced in section 2.01, there are two model- ing paradigms for the interconnection of thermoacoustic network models. It is the classical frequency domain methods and the state space modeling. The respective interconnection al- gorithms will be introduced in the following sections on a generic network model shown in Fig. 2.07. The model consists of a closed R 1 = 1 and an open end R 2 = −1 and two duct sections D 1, D 2 of equal length l/2 with upstream (u), intermediary (i) and downstream (d) acoustic interfaces. 2.04.01 Frequency Domain Interconnection As we have seen in section 2.02.01, the transformation of linear models from time into frequency domain resolves the convolution with a Green’s function into a multiplication with the transfer 2.04 Interconnection function. Thus it is possible to transform all linear subsystem models to frequency domain and evaluate the interconnection by a set of algebraic equations. The two duct models are: [gu(s) fi (s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ e−sτ 0 ][fu(s) gi (s) ]; [gi (s) fd (s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ e−sτ 0 ][ fi (s) gd (s) ] (2.038) with τ = l/(2 c) and the reﬂection coefﬁcients: fu = gu; gd = −fd.

Thermoacoustic Network Modeling 2.04.02 Universal State Space Interconnection If all subsystems of the acoustic network model as shown in Fig. 2.07 are modeled as state space systems, they can be connected by a universal interconnection algorithm for state space systems. The algorithm is similar to the ones used by Matlab Control System Toolbox and Octave Control Toolbox. At ﬁrst the theoretic derivation for the interconnection algorithm is presented, followed by the application to the minimal example in analogy to the previous frequency domain section. 2.04.02.01 Interconnection of State Space Models At ﬁrst the system matrices A,B,C,D,E of the systems 1, 2.N that shall be connected are block diagonally appended as exemplary shown for A: ˜A =   A 1 0 0 0 0 A 2 0 0 0 0. 0 0 0 0 AN  ; (2.045) The corresponding state, input and output vectors are: x =   x 1 x 2. x N  ; ˜u =   u 1 u 2. u N  ; ˜y =   y 1 y 2. y N  . (2.046) The interconnection itself is expressed by the feedback equation ˜u = F ˜y +u (2.047) where F is the feedback matrix, which contains mostly zeros and ones to indicate outputs ˜y which are internally connected to inputs ˜u. The feedback equation of the resulting system of equations ˜E ˙x = ˜Ax + ˜B ˜u (2.048) ˜y = ˜C x+ ˜D ˜u (2.049) ˜u = F ˜y +u. (2.050) can be solved for the input ˜u = (1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜C x+(1 −F ˜D)−1 u. (2.051) and the solution is substituted in order to obtain the system matrices of the interconnected state space system: A = ˜A + ˜B(1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜C; B = ˜B(1 −F ˜D)−1; C = ˜C + ˜D(1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜C; D = ˜D(1 −F ˜D)−1; E = ˜E. (2.052) 2.04 Interconnection 2.04.02.02 SS Interconnection Minimal Example The interconnection algorithm is now illustrated by the application to the minimal example shown in Fig. 2.07. Discretization and numbering is done in analogy to section 2.03.01.03 and Fig. 2.04. The state space representation of the duct models is given by: d dt [f 2 f 3 ] = [−a 0 a −a ][f 2 f 3 ] + [a ][ fu ] (2.053) [ fi ] = [ 0 1 ][f 2 f 3 ] + [ ][ fu ] (2.054) d dt [f 4 f 5 ] = [−a 0 a −a ][f 4 f 5 ] + [a ][ fi ] (2.055) [ fd ] = [ 0 1 ][f 4 f 5 ] + [ ][ fi ]. (2.056) d dt [g 1 g 2 ] = [a −a 0 a ][g 1 g 2 ] + [ 0 −a ][ gi ] (2.057) [ gu ] = [ 1 0 ][g 1 g 2 ] + [ ][ gi ] (2.058) d dt [g 3 g 4 ] = [a −a 0 a ][g 3 g 4 ] + [ 0 −a ][ gd ] (2.059) [ gi ] = [ 1 0 ][g 3 g 4 ] + [ ][ gd ]. (2.060) Due to the numbering scheme, the acoustic states on the interfaces correspond to: fu = f 1, gu = g 1, fi = f 3, gi = g 3,fd = f 5, gd = g 5. States 2, 4 are internal states of duct D 1 respectively D 2. In addition to that, the boundaries are just feed-through conditions: [ fu ] = [ ][ gu ]; [ gd ] = [ −1 ][ fd ] (2.061) Appending the system matrices results in ˜A =   −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a  ; ˜B =   a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −a   (2.062) Thermoacoustic Network Modeling ˜C =   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ; ˜D =   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0   (2.063) x =   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4  ; ˜y =   fu fi fd gu gi gd  ; ˜u =   fu fi fd gu gi gd  ; u = [ ] (2.064) The system is closed by the feedback equation (2.047): ˜u =   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   ˜y + [ ] u (2.065) Due to the arrangement of ˜u and ˜y, the feedback matrix F is unity in this particular case. It is an autonomous system, therefore thre are no remaining external in- or outputs u, y. Subsequently, the feedback equation is solved as given by eq. (2.051) and the system matrix is retrieved from eq. (2.052): A =   −a 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a −a 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 a   (2.066) The system has an order of n=8. We are using the same duct resolution as in section 2.03.01, therefore the upper left 4 x 4 sub matrix, which is modeling the f wave dynamics, is identical to eq. (2.032). A comparison of the eigenvalues of the analytic solution, the ﬁrst order upwind scheme n=8 as shown above, third order upwind n=8 and high resolution third order upwind n=80 is shown in Fig. 2.08. The ﬁrst quarter wave eigenvalue is approximated fairly well by all three state space systems. Whereas the highly resolved system matches all four eigenvalues in the given frequency range, the two systems of order n=8, exhibit highly damped modes. This cor- responds well to the general behavior of the state space models in the frequency response plots 2.05 Stability of Thermoacoustic Systems −1.04 −1.02 −1 −0.08 −0.06 −0.04 −0.02 00 0.025 0.05 0.075 1.025 1.05 1.075 στ/2π ωτ/2π Figure 2.08: Eigenvalues of the minimal network system.

The most important feature of the discretization scheme is that it is conservative in the sense that the resulting models are stable for analytically marginally stable systems. 2.05 Stability of Thermoacoustic Systems One practical application of thermoacoustic network modeling is to determine the asymptotic stability of a system. It is achieved by computing the eigenvalues or poles of the linear system and to determine whether all poles are stable. This is the case if Re{si } < 0 (2.067) for all eigenvalues si of the system. Subsequently algorithms to compute eigenvalues for clas- sical frequency domain models and state space models are presented. 2.05.01 Classical Frequency Domain Model Solver As stated in section 2.04.01, the search for eigenvalues involves the search for zeros of the char- acteristic equation, also called dispersion relation: det(I −G(s)) = 0. (2.068) Thermoacoustic Network Modeling This is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The solution involves an iterative procedure which solves the optimization problem mins ∥det(I −G(s))∥. (2.069) From an initial value s∗ a gradient descent algorithm is used to ﬁnd the zeros one by one. With each iterative step, the determinant of the system needs to be computed, which is computation- ally very expensive for large systems. Depending on the smoothness of the dispersion relation, it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd all eigenvalues, as gradient descent is just able to ﬁnd local minima. Then it may be necessary to search the complex plane with many initial values s∗ in order to ﬁnd all eigenvalues in a certain region. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine whether all eigenvalues have been found. All in all, the procedure is computationally very expensive and inefﬁcient. 2.05.02 State Space Model Eigenvalue Solver In the case of state space systems, the eigenvalues are the poles of the dispersion relation as well. This time however it involves solving just for a non-hermitian generalized linear eigenvalue problem as opposed to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the classical methods. (Es − A)x = 0 (2.070) There are very efﬁcient standard procedures to solve this type of equation. For small systems, direct solvers can compute all eigenvalues in a single run. When the order of the system becomes large, iterative algorithms to compute a distinct number of eigenvalues close to some value s∗ are the standard procedure. Such algorithms are given by Arnoldi methods. This procedure involves solving a shifted and inverted eigenvalue problem of a matrix pencil (A −Es ∗)−1. The inversion of the matrix is not computed explicitly, as only the vector product with the inverted matrix is needed. This is achieved by an LU decomposition of the matrix pencil. For large systems the LU decomposition is very expensive and takes up most of the computational time compared to the Arnoldi iterations. Therefore we suggest to use a special LU algorithm tailored for sparse systems called MUMPS for this step. 3 Sound Power Ampliﬁcation and Acoustic Energy of Thermoacoustic Systems In the previous section it was already shown how the linear stability of a thermoacoustic net- work model can be computed if models for the entire system are known. There are two reasons, why an investigation of acoustic energy or more general perturbation energy is of interest. At ﬁrst, the linear stability of a thermoacoustic system does not enforce the stability of the un- derlying nonlinear system. This raises the need for proper Lyapunov function based nonlinear stability proofs. Lyapunov functions are generalized energy functions, which are used to show the convergence of a system to a certain orbit respectively ﬁx point. Secondly, thermoa- coustic systems tend to be very complex with many nontrivial interactions. In order to handle the complexity, it is important to ﬁnd a method to characterize the stability properties of in- dividual subsystems like a single burner of a gas turbine. This is achieved by the instability potentiality criterion, which is based on sound power ampliﬁcation. 3.01 Nonlinear Stability It is a well known result from turbulence investigation, that the prediction of laminar-turbulent ﬂow transition is under predicted by the stability of linearized perturbation models. There are cases when, even though those models predict linear stability, the ﬂow transitions to turbulence. The effect that the system transitions from a linearly stable ﬁx point to chaos or a limit cycle is called \"triggering\". Trefethen et al have shown that this behavior relates to the great sensitivity of pseudo- spectra of the non-normal linearized matrix operator and the transient growth of perturbations. Schmid gives a review about methods that have emerged from non-modal stability analysis. Gebhardt and Grossmann have investigated a nonlinear model and shown that instability and chaotic behavior may occur if the linearized model is non-normal and there is so called nonlinear mixing. The nonlinearity mixes energy from those states that had transiently grown back into perturbations that are about to grow. Those investigations relate to ﬂow instability and turbulence, but especially ﬂame models cause large non-normal effects. Thus the linear stability of a thermoacoustic model does not imply stability of the underlying nonlinear system. In order to prove nonlinear stability, a Lyapunov function, also called generalized energy function, for the state of a system around an orbit or ﬁx point needs to be found. If such a function exists, then the system is stable. The generalized energy function needs to be positive deﬁnite and the proof is achieved by showing, that the Sound Power Ampliﬁcation and Acoustic Energy of Thermoacoustic Systems energy is monotonously decreasing over time departing from any given state x. There exists a Lyapunov function for linear state space systems if and only if all eigenvalues of the system are strictly stable Re{si } < 0. The generalized energy function is a quadratic form of the state: E(x) = x T Px, (3.01) where P is the energy norm and therefore a positive deﬁnite and symmetric matrix, which is retrieved by solving the so called Lyapunov equation: PA + AH P +Q = 0. (3.02) Here Q is an arbitrary positive deﬁnite and symmetric matrix and−x T Qx is the dissipation rate. There is an extension of this method to state space systems, that possess a descriptor matrix E given by Takaba et al. Instead of formulating an arbitrary Lyapunov function, it is possible to derive it directly from the physically motivated perturbation energy inside of an acoustic domain. There are several different suggestions for the deﬁnition of acoustic energy and sound power found in literature by Chu, Cantrell et al, Morfey Myers, more recently Giauque et al and Brear et al. The mathematically most elaborate deﬁnition was issued by Myers and is based on an inﬁnite series expansion of the Navier-Stokes equations. He provides a proof that his deﬁnition of perturbation energy deﬁned by ﬁrst order terms is exact up to second order. However, as George et al point out, Myers deﬁnition of perturbation energy is positive deﬁnite, but not symmetric for non-zero mean ﬂow, whereas Chu’s deﬁnition is. Therefore Myers energy corollary is beautiful, but not suitable to construct a Lyapunov function, whereas Chu’s is less elaborate, but more useful. However, unlike total ﬂow energy, perturbation energy is not a preserved quantity. It can be ampliﬁed or attenuated by the mean ﬂow. In order to prove the stability of such a system, those interactions need to be accounted for in the energy balance as investigated by Blumenthal et al. This is achieved by the modeling of so called ports between the different domains of the network model in which individual generalized energy functions exist. There is substantial efforts to use Lyapunov functions in the context of network models under the topic of port- Hamiltonian systems and passivity based control. 3.02 Instability Potentiality and Small Gain Theorem Instead of constructing a Lyapunov function from the internal state of a system, it is possible to state a stability criterion based on the input- output behavior. The theoretic basis was developed by Zames and is called the small gain theorem. In system theory, the supremum of the norm of the outputs of a system y = Sys (u) over all possible inputs u is called \"gain\". g(Sys ) = sup∥Sys (u)∥ ∥u∥ (3.03) The gain of an interconnected system Sys 1 ·Sys 2 is bound by the product of the individual gains of Sys 1 and Sys 2. If the individual systems are stable and the gain is less than unity, then the 3.02 Instability Potentiality and Small Gain Theorem interconnected system is stable, hence the name \"small gain theorem\". Due to the gain acting as an upper bound, the small gain criterion is sufﬁcient, but not necessary: g(Sys 1 ·Sys 2) ≤ g(Sys 1)g(Sys 2) < 1 (3.04) The proof of the theorem poses only few requirements that the norm must fulﬁll. Identity should be mapped to one, zero to zero and the norm should be continuously deﬁned. The small gain theorem is closely related to the classical Nyquist stability criterion and represents an extension to nonlinear multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems. In the context of linear thermoacoustic systems, the maximum sound power ampliﬁcation of the frequency response can be used as metric for the gain. This criterion is already known in the community as whistling potential or instability potentiality. In the following derivations, a link between sound power ampliﬁcation and the scattering matrix of an acoustic system will be established. As mentioned in the previous section, there are several different deﬁnitions of perturbation energy and sound power transferred through an interface. Whereas Polifke and Emmert et al used the low Mach deﬁnition for instantaneous sound power transfer respectively intensity ﬂuctuations I′: I′ = p′u′, (3.05) we use the version of Morfey : I′ = p′u′ + u 0 ρ0 c 2 p′2 + u 2 c 2 p′u′ +ρ0 u 0 u′2 (3.06) Aurégan et al have shown that it can be factored into the product of acoustic exergy ﬂuc- tuations Π′ and acoustic mass ﬂux m′ using the linearized equation of state for a perfect ﬂuid p′ = c 2ρ′: I′ = Π′m′; (3.07) m′ = ρ0 u′ +ρ′u 0; (3.08) Π′ = p′ ρ0 +u 0 u′ (3.09) Acoustic waves f, g as deﬁned in section 2.03.01 are used to split the exergy transfer and mass ﬂux into two directions ±: Π′ = p′ ρ0 +uo ·u′ = f (c +u 0) +g(c −u 0) = Π′ + +Π′ − (3.010) m′ =ρ0(f −g) +p′/c 2 u 0 =ρ0 c (f (c +u 0) +g(u 0 −c)) = m′ + +m′ − = ρ0 c Π′ + − ρ0 c Π′ − (3.011) With Π′ + = f (c +uo); m′ + = ρ0 c Π′ +, (3.012) Π′ − = g(c −uo); m′ − = −ρ0 c Π′ −.

Equations (3.07) (3.010) and (3.011) give: I′ = (Π′ + +Π′ −)(ρ0 c Π′ + − ρ0 c Π′ −) = ρ0 c (Π′2 + −Π′2 −) (3.014) Short term temporal averaging over one period of the product of real parts of harmonically oscillating quantities results in: I = ρ0 2 c ( ˆΠH + ˆΠ+ − ˆΠH − ˆΠ−) (3.015) where ˆ· represents the complex amplitudes and ·H stands for the Hermitian (complex conjugate transpose). Spatial integration over one cross section assuming constant mean ﬂow and plane waves gives the net acoustic sound power transferred across the interface: W = AI = Aρ0 2 c ( ˆΠH + ˆΠ+ − ˆΠH − ˆΠ−) = ˜ΠH + ˜Π+ − ˜ΠH − ˜Π− (3.016) with the normalized exergy ﬂuctuations ˜Π = √ Aρ0 2 c ˆΠ.

(3.020) The relation between emitted and incident acoustic exergy ﬂuctuation ﬂow is described by the exergy scattering matrix Σ. The gain of the system is according to Eq. (3.03): g = sup ∥ ˜ΠH − ˜Π−∥ ∥ ˜ΠH + ˜Π+∥ = sup ∥ ˜ΠH + ΣH Σ ˜Π+∥ ∥ ˜ΠH + ˜Π+∥ (3.021) Without loss of generality, we choose normalized inputs such that ∥ ˜ΠH + ˜Π+∥ ≡1 g = sup ˜Π+ ∥ ˜ΠH + ΣH Σ ˜Π+∥ =sup ω∈R σ(Σ(jω))) = ∥Σ∥∞ (3.022) and solutions can be expressed by the maximum eigenvalue of ΣH Σ respectively the maximum singular value of Σ. This deﬁnition corresponds to the so called H∞ norm of the energy scat- tering matrix Σ. The basis vectors of the SVD are the orthogonal directions of minimum and maximum sound power ampliﬁcation. The gain g = ∥Σ∥∞ is called the instability potentiality of the system. Sound Power Ampliﬁcation and Acoustic Energy of Thermoacoustic Systems If the gain exceeds 1, the system ampliﬁes sound power, if it is less than 1, the system attenuates sound power. Following this derivation, there is a naive stability criterion based on the small gain theorem: Assuming passive boundaries with a gain g of 1, burner and ﬂame scattering matrices with a gain of less than 1 will result in a stable thermoacoustic system. As stated above, the criterion is sufﬁcient but not necessary for stability and typically violated by systems involving a ﬂame. Premixed ﬂames exhibit scattering matrix resonance peaks, which exceed unity sound power ampliﬁcation by far, as shown in Fig. 3.02. It is safe to assume, that an unstable burner system may be stabilized by coupling it with different acoustic boundaries. Therefore, the instability potentiality is not suitable to prove stability of combustion systems. However it can be used as an optimization criterion to minimize the maximum sound power ampliﬁcation of a burner and to ﬁgure out critical frequencies. On the other side, it may be useful to maximize the sound power ampliﬁcation in applications such as thermoacoustic stacks in thermoacoustic engines. The energy scattering matrixΣ is related to the acoustic scattering matrix S by a constant rescal- ing V+, V− as shown in Eq. (3.020). For low Mach numbers Ma → 0 it can even be shown, that V+ = V− and the singular values of S and Σ are identical. Therefore, peaks in the frequency response of the scattering matrix are also peaks in sound power ampliﬁcation. This is illus- trated in Fig. 3.02, which shows the singular values and scattering matrix of a burner and ﬂame system. The physical reason for such peaks in acoustic power ampliﬁcation at distinct fre- quencies are resonance phenomena inside of the system. One such phenomenon is given by the so called intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback of premixed ﬂames, which will be investigated in the following chapter. 4 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames It is a known phenomenon that there are peaks in the scattering matrix of premixed ﬂames. Bomberg et al have shown that the resonance mechanism, which causes these peaks, is caused by a ﬂame intrinsic acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic feedback. Premixed ﬂames respond to velocity ﬂuctuations upstream of the ﬂame at the burner mouth with a heat release modula- tion. The resulting heat release ﬂuctuations in turn act as a volume source and generate an upstream traveling acoustic wave. This wave closes the feedback as it causes a velocity pertur- bation at the burner mouth. Flame intrinsic modes have since been reproduced and investigated by several research groups [35, 56–58]. Emmert et al have demonstrated that the ﬂame intrinsic resonances are the cause for strong sound power ampliﬁcation and in consequence for potential thermoacoustic instabilities. Eventually, Emmert et al have shown, that the ﬂame intrinsic modes exist besides the acoustic modes and actually play an important role in full thermoacoustic systems like burner test rigs and supposedly also in entire gas turbines. This result causes a paradigm shift in the analysis of thermoacoustic systems. Previous investi- gations attributed at the time inexplicable low frequency eigenmodes of thermoacous- tic systems to some Helmholtz or longitudinal acoustic modes, but in fact they were caused by ﬂame intrinsic resonance. We show that classical stabilization measures, such as to increase damping by a perforated plate termination in a burner test rig, may actually render the system more unstable. Even though all acoustic modes are damped, intrinsic modes may be ampliﬁed. The following derivations are based on state space modeling and preceded, where a clas- sical frequency domain approach is used. For people, who have been working in the ﬁeld, the argument using the classical frequency domain method is more intuitive and easier to under- stand. However the state space modeling has a clarity, which makes the existence of intrinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes trivial. The dynamics of a full combustion systems with reﬂective boundaries are modeled using a low order acoustic network model. Such models are able to predict the dynamics and stability of thermoacoustic systems in experiments, and DNS simulations. 4.01 Low Order Combustor Test Rig Network Model We investigate a linear acoustic network model that is depicted in Figure 4.01, with model pa- rameters speciﬁed in Table 4.01.

The model is very similar to the one used by Tay-Wo-Chong et al with a length of the com- bustion chamber l C = 0.07 m, which we will refer to for validation purposes. Whereas the model of Tay-Wo-Chong et al was a classical frequency domain low order network model, here linear state space models as described in section 2 and are used. Propagation of acoustic waves is modeled by 1 D linearized Euler equations, which are spatially discretized using a third order upwind scheme. The frequency range of interest is up to 500 Hz, which is below the cut on frequency of the plenum fcut on = 1.084 ·c/2π·r ≈ 1000 Hz, where the radius is r = 0.010 m. All area jumps are modeled as acoustically compact elements and in contrast to Tay’s work without losses or correction factors. As in the work by Tay-Wo-Chong et al, the swirler is assumed to be acoustically transparent and is therefore neglected. The acoustic boundary condi- tions are an upstream closed end and a downstream open end. In contrast to that, Tay considered on the downstream side a reﬂection coefﬁcient of a perforated plate, which was not precisely determined and is in the range between −1 and 0. The acoustic ﬂame model is derived from linearized jump equations and consists of an acoustically compact temperature jump with heat release ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ as additional input. The relations were originally derived by Chu and presented in state space formulation by Emmert et al. The model is closed by a ﬂame transfer function (FTF) model that relates an upstream velocity perturbation u′ at the burner mouth to a heat release ﬂuctuation of the ﬂame. This FTF model was retrieved from LES simu- lation and system identiﬁcation (SI) techniques and was validated against experimental results by Tay-Wo-Chong et al. Its impulse response is shown in Figure 4.04. As illustrated by the boxes in Figure 4.01, the network model elements can be combined into four state space subsystem models for the acoustic boundaries (u,d), the acoustics of the burner (b), and the ﬂame dynamics (f). 4.01.01 Boundary Subsystem As Figure 4.01 shows, the two boundaries up- and downstream are composite models. The up- stream part consists of a closed end, two duct sections of the plenum and the mixing tube and an area contraction in between. Downstream there is just a duct section of the combustion chamber and an open end. The two systems can be appended to form the up- and downstream boundary model (ud): ˙xud = [Au 0 0 Ad ]    Aud xud +Bud [gu fd ]  uud (4.01) [fu gd ]  yud =Cud xud (4.02) There is no feed through Dud = 0 because the incident waves are propagating in duct sections before they are reﬂected. Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames 4.01.02 Flame Subsystem The combustion dynamics of turbulent premixed swirl stabilized ﬂames are modeled by a ﬂame transfer function. The single input of the ﬂame model are velocity ﬂuctuations u′ at a reference position at the burner mouth and the output are global heat release ﬂuctuations of the ﬂame ˙Q′: ˙xf =Af xf +Bf [ u′]  uf (4.03) [ ˙Q′]  yf =Cf xf (4.04) It is assumed that the ﬂame does not have a feed through D f = 0 either. The state space system can be solved for the ﬂame transfer function (FTF) by Laplace transform: ˙Q′ =Cf (s I − Af )−1 Bf   FT F(s) u′. (4.05) The impulse response of the ﬂame model is depicted in Figure 4.04. 4.01.03 Burner Subsystem It is assumed that the burner subsystem, which consists of the area expansion into the com- bustion chamber and the temperature jump, is acoustically compact. This assumption is valid because the length of the burner l B ≈ 0.0074 m is much smaller than the wavelength at 500 Hz: λ = c/f ≈ 0.07 m. It is possible to carry out this investigation under consideration of ﬁnite length of the burner, but doing so does not change the fundamental results and merely adds complexity to the derivations. Due to the compactness and lack of losses, the burner itself does not possess any dynamics. Subscript b stands for the burner subsystem, f indicates connections to the ﬂame and subscript ud refers to connections of the up- and downstream boundary subsystem. [yb,ud yb,f ] = [Db,ud,ud Db,ud,f Db,f,ud Db,f,f ]    Db [ub,ud ub,f ], (4.06) where the input and output vectors are [yb,ud yb,f ] =   gu fd u′  , [ub,ud ub,f ] =   fu gd ˙Q′  . (4.07) 4.01 Low Order Combustor Test Rig Network Model 4.01.04 Full BRS System In order to solve for the dynamics of the full composite network model, the three subsystems are appended: [˙xud ˙xf ] = [Aud 0 0 Af ][xud xf ] + [Bud 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bf ]   uud ub,ud ub,f uf   (4.08)   yud yb,ud yb,f yf  =   Cud 0 0 0 0 0 0 Cf   [xud xf ] +   0 0 0 0 0 Db,ud,ud Db,ud,f 0 0 Db,f,ud Db,f,f 0 0 0 0 0     uud ub,ud ub,f uf   (4.09) and the feedback by interconnections of the system is evaluated:   uud ub,ud ub,f uf  =   0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0     yud yb,ud yb,f yf  . (4.010) Now the output equation (4.09) is plugged into the feedback equation (4.010) and solved for the inputs:   uud ub,ud ub,f uf  =   1 −Db,ud,ud −Db,ud,f 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 −Db,f,ud −Db,f,f 1   −1   0 0 Cud 0 0 Cf 0 0   [xud xf ] (4.011) Substituting the input vector in the state equation 4.08 using the previous result from equa- tion 4.011 results in the system matrix of the full model: [˙xud ˙xf ] = [Aud +Bud Cud Db,udud Bud Cf Db,ud f Bf Cud Db,f ud Af +Bf Cf Db,f f ]    A [xud xf ] (4.012) It is an autonomous system and therefore has no physical in- and outputs. In order to provide validation of the network model, the eigenvalues of the full system are computed and plotted as crosses in Figure 4.02. In agreement with, three dominant -least decaying- modes exist at approximately 42 Hz, 111 Hzand 315 Hz. The growth rates of all eigen- frequencies are negative, thus the full system is stable. Tay mentions that the eigenvalue close to 100 Hzis unstable in the expermimental BRS test rig. This is in agreement with the predictions of the model, where although the mode is predicted to be stable, it is the least decaying of the three. According to a preliminary estimation of Tay-Wo-Chong et al, there are only two acoustic modes expected in the frequency range under investigation. Thus he contributed one of the three dominant modes to ﬂame dynamics. In the following sections we will show that this assumption is actually true and how the eigenmodes of the full BRS model relate to its acoustic eigenmodes and its intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) eigenmodes.

This is achieved by at ﬁrst disassembling the BRS model into an Acoustic and an intrinsic Burner & Flame system. Subsequently the system is re-assemblied with a modulation parameter that will establish a link between the full BRS system and the Acoustic and the ITA Burner & Flame systems. 4.02.01 Acoustic System The pure acoustic eigenmodes of the system are retrieved by connecting just the burner model and the boundaries, see Figures 4.01, 4.03(a). Thus the ﬂame transfer function and therefore the ﬂame dynamics are omitted, but the mean temperature jump due to the combustion is retained in the model. This implies that all links to and from the ﬂame can be omitted and the reduced burner system (equation 4.06) is: yb,ud = Db,ud,ud ub,ud (4.013) The state space model of the appended boundary and burner system is: ˙x = Aud x + [ Bud 0 ][ uud ub,ud ] (4.014) [ yud yb,ud ] = [Cud ] x + [0 0 0 Db,ud,ud ][ uud ub,ud ] (4.015) with feedback: [ uud ub,ud ] = [0 1 1 0 ][ yud yb,ud ]. (4.016) 4.02 BRS Model Disassembly and Reassembly The system matrix AA resulting from the interconnection is: AA = [ Aud +Bud Cud Db,ud,ud ]. (4.017) Figure 4.02 shows the eigenvalues of the acoustic modes as blue circles. It is not possible to determine which mode of the full system (black crosses) corresponds to an acoustic mode. As can be seen, the full system overall exhibits more than just the acoustic eigenmodes. Particularly amongst the most dominant low frequency eigenvalues in the range above −20 Hzgrowth rate and below 500 Hzfrequency, there are three modes of the full system, but just two acoustic modes. 4.02.02 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Burner & Flame System Previous investigations by Emmert et al have shown that there may be very strong ampliﬁ- cation of acoustic waves, as they are scattered by the Burner & Flame (BF) of a combustion sys- tem. This ampliﬁcation was contributed to intrinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes of the Burner & Flame resulting from an acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic feedback described by Bomberg et al. Figure 4.03(b) illustrates the Burner & Flame model that exhibits the intrinsic eigenmodes. For investigating the Burner & Flame system, the burner is disconnected from the boundaries and can be reduced to: yb,f = Db,f,f ub,f (4.018) Aggregating the burner and ﬂame systems ˙x = Af x + [ Bf 0 ][ uf ub,f ] (4.019) [ yf yb,f ] = [Cf ] x + [0 0 0 Db,f,f ][ uf ub,f ] (4.020) with feedback: [ uf ub,f ] = [0 1 1 0 ][ yf yb,f ] (4.021) leads to the system matrix ABF of the intrinsic Burner & Flame system: ABF = [ Af +Bf Cf Db,f,f ]. (4.022) Eigenvalues of the pure intrinsic Burner & Flame system are ploted in Figure 4.02 as red boxes. Due to the high order of the LES system identiﬁcation FTF heat release model, there are many intrinsic eigenvalues in the frequency range of interest. All of the intrinsic eigenvalues are stable and there is one least decaying and therefore most dominant eigenmode at ≈ 100 Hz. The frequency of this eigenmode is corresponding to a characteristic time scale of the reso- nant process τBF = 1/100 Hz = 0.001 s. As the Burner & Flame domain is acoustically almost compact ( τ ≫ l/c), this delay is mostly governed by the ﬂow-ﬂame dynamics modeled by the ﬂame transfer function. Due to the negative relation between the velocity perturbation and the upstream traveling acoustic wave u′ ∝ −gu, the characteristic time of the burner & ﬂame feedback is expected to be about twice the characteristic time delay of the FTF respectively Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames +_ u'A gu,BF fd,BF + + + + (a) Acoustic system. _ u'A FTF gu,BF fd,BF + + (b) Intrinsic burner & ﬂame system. +_ fd,BF + + + + _ u'A FTF gu,BF ++ μ μ μ (c) Coupled, modulated system.

Estimating τFT F from Figure 4.04 is showing agreement with this assumption: τBF /2 = 0.0005 s ≈ 0.00048 s = τFT F. At this point, we can draw the conclusion, that it is very likely, that the three dominant modes of the BRS model are related to two acoustic modes and one intrinsic mode of the system. However it is not clear which of the modes of the full system is associated with which resonant process. t (s) 0 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 FTF -200 -100 Figure 4.04: Impulse response of the BRS ﬂame transfer function. 4.02.03 Modulated Coupling of Burner & Flame and Acoustic System In order to discriminate between modes of the full system originating from acoustic modes and such from Burner & Flame modes, the coupling between them is modulated. The waves gu,BF and fd,BF generated by the intrinsic BF subsystem are injected into the acoustic system by the off diagonal coupling term Db,f,ud from the burner system equation 4.06. In the other direction, velocity perturbations u′ A originating from the acoustic subsystem are linked back into the intrinsic system by the term Db,ud,f. We will modulate the cross talking terms with an artiﬁcial paramter µ as shown schematically in Figure 4.03(c). The modulated burner system is: [yb,ud yb,f ] = [Db,ud,ud µµµDb,ud,f µµµDb,f,ud Db,f,f ][ub,ud ub,f ]. (4.023) The full coupled system with modulation parameter (M) is evaluated the same way as the full system and this results in: [˙xud ˙xf ] = [Aud +Bud Cud Db,udud µµµBud Cf Db,ud f µµµBf Cud Db,f ud Af +Bf Cf Db,f f ]    AM [xud xf ] (4.024) Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames where the parameter µ is modulating the coupling. For µ = 1, the system matrix of the modulated system is equivalent to the one of the full system (equation 4.012). Therefore, the systems have the same eigenvalues. Considering µ = 0 instead, the system matrix is a Block diagonal matrix containing the acoustic and the intrinsic system matrices (see equations 4.017,4.022): [˙xud ˙xf ] = [AA 0 0 ABF ][xud xf ] (4.025) The characteristic polynomial factors into: 0 = det(s I − AA)det( s I − ABF ). (4.026) Thus, the system exactly has the sum of the acoustic and the Burner & Flame system’s eigen- modes. 4.03 Numerical Results Using the derivations from the previous sections, the BRS system is now examined numerically. For this purpose, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the systems under investigation are com- puted. At ﬁrst the modulation parameter is used to discriminate between acoustic and Burner & Flame eigenmodes of the full system. Subsequently, the eigenvectors of the most dominant eigenmodes are analyzed. Eventually the inﬂuence of the downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient on the eigenvalues of the system is investigated. Overall, special attention is drawn to the differ- ences between acoustic and Burner & Flame ITA eigenmodes. 4.03.01 Correspondence of Eigenvalues In the previous sections, we have shown that for µ = 1, the full system dynamics are recovered from the system with modulation parameter. For µ = 0 the dynamics of the acoustic and Burner & Flame systems emerges. By sweeping the parameterµ continuously from 0 to 1, we can track how the eigenmodes evolve from acoustic and Burner & Flame ITA to full system eigenmodes as shown in Figure 4.05. The sweep establishes a clear relation between the eigenmodes of the full system and the acous- tic and intrinsic systems. We observe, that the three most dominant - highest growth rate - eigen- modes of the full system are in fact due to two acoustic cavity and one ITA mode. Furthermore, all eigenvalues get shifted and the shifting is not linear. Both acoustic eigenmodes are stabilized by the coupling with the ﬂame dynamics. Opposed to that the most dominant Burner & Flame mode becomes more unstable. 4.03 Numerical Results −20 −10 0 10 200 Growth Rate (Hz) Frequency (Hz) Figure 4.05: Correspondence of acoustic ( ) and Burner & Flame ITA () to full system () eigen- modes.

The ﬁrst (blue) and second (black) acoustic and intrinsic (red) eigenmodes are shown in Figure 4.07. The mode shapes of the pure acoustic system are drawn as dashed lines, wheres the full system modes are full lines. The ﬁrst acoustic mode has almost constant phase for both pressure and velocity through- out the system. In the plenum, there is a high pressure and in the mixing tube, there is high velocity, whereas in the combustion chamber, there are overall low amplitudes. Therefore the ﬁrst acoustic mode is a Helmholtz mode of the plenum and mixing tube. Due to the coupling with the ﬂame, it is shifted towards higher pressures and velocities in the combustion chamber and comparatively lower velocities in the mixing section. This is what is to be expected as the ﬂame is mainly acting as a volume source. We observe that for the second acoustic mode velocity ﬂuctuations follow pressure ﬂuctua- tions by π/2. Also the comparably large amplitudes of velocity and pressure and the combustion chamber indicate that it is a quarter wave resonance of the combustion chamber.

Overall, the second acoustic mode shape is not much affected by the coupling with the ﬂame. The pure and the full system mode shapes are very similar. The intrinsic mode shape can only be visualized for the full system, because the pure intrinsic mode is just due to ﬂame dynamics and per deﬁnition prohibits a resonating acoustic ﬁeld. The ITA mode of the full system has features similar to both acoustic modes. The pressure proﬁle looks a lot like the second acoustic mode, including the phase jump at the end of the plenum, whereas the velocity proﬁle seems closer to the one of the ﬁrst acoustic mode. Thus it is difﬁcult to distinguish the intrinsic mode from acoustic modes by comparing mode shapes. 4.03.03 Sensitivity of Eigenvalues to Downstream Reﬂection Coefﬁcient As mentioned by Tay-Wo-Chong et al, the downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient of the BRS test rig is not known precisely. Therefore, a parameter study of the changes in eigenvalue due to changes in the reﬂection coefﬁcient is carried out. It is varied between −1, which is a fully reﬂective open end and 0, a non reﬂective boundary condition. The level in the experiment is bounded by those values. Figure 4.08 shows that the reduction of reﬂections has a damping effect on the two acoustic modes of the system, whereas the intrinsic mode becomes even more unstable. As the acoustic modes need the reﬂections at boundaries to exist, the higher damping is to be expected. The ﬁrst acoustic mode, which is a Helmholtz mode of the plenum, degenerates for a non reﬂective downstream boundary to a frequency of 0 Hz. The second acoustic mode remains resonating, but gets heavily damped. It is interesting that the intrinsic mode is getting more ampliﬁed and even becomes unstable as the reﬂections are reduced. This is a counter intuitive result, as one would assume that less reﬂections relate to more acoustic losses and therefore increased overall 4.04 Conclusion −40 −20 0 200 Growth Rate (Hz) Frequency (Hz) Figure 4.08: Eigenvalue shift due to changes in downstream reﬂection factor.

But the ﬁnding is in agreement with the assertion of Tay-Wo-Chong et al that in the experiment this mode is unstable. 4.04 Conclusion Thermoacoustic systems exhibit acoustic and intrinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes. The total number of eigenmodes is greater than just the number of acoustic cavity modes. Intrinsic ther- moacoustic eigenmodes of velocity sensitive premixed ﬂames are due to an acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame- acoustic feedback. The concept of intrinsic feedback is fairly general and can be expected to take place in different combustion regimes as well as for different sound generation and ampliﬁca- tion phenomena. Heat release ﬂuctuations due to technically premixed ﬂames can couple with the mixing process. Even aero-acoustic whistling may be expected to be caused by an intrinsic feedback. The eigenmodes of the full system are corresponding, but not equivalent to pure intrinsic and acoustic modes. By modulation of the coupling parameter µ between Burner & Flame intrinsic and acoustic dynamics, full system modes can be identiﬁed to be caused by either intrinsic feedback or by acoustic resonance. Due to the modulation, all acoustic and intrinsic modes are shifted in frequency and growth rate. The closer the eigenfrequency of the intrinsic and acoustic modes match, the more they interact. It is hard to predict whether the coupling will stabilize or destabilize a mode as the effect is not linear. It is important that a thermoacoustic model is able to reproduce the intrinsic eigenmodes, as they may lead to instability even if the acoustic modes are stable. This may put into question thermoacoustic models that assume weak coupling of the ﬂame for stability prediction. Paradoxically increasing acoustic losses by non reﬂective boundaries such as perforated plates Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Feedback of Premixed Flames may render a thermoacoustic system unstable. Even though the acoustic modes get damped, an intrinsic Burner & Flame mode may get ampliﬁed. 5 Summary of Achievements The author has contributed to the modeling, the stability analysis and the fundamental under- standing of thermoacoustic systems. These contributions are reﬂected in four major publica- tions, which are linked by the aim of promoting the advancement of efﬁcient modeling of ther- moacoustic systems. He has developed and implemented a uniﬁed thermoacoustic modeling framework based on linear state space models and system theory, as documented by the ﬁrst paper. It enables us to seamlessly incorporate and connect models from a wide variety of modeling methods: 1 D analytical solutions, linearized PDEs of perturbation equations and system identiﬁcation. The framework provides a method to connect the sets of models that constitute a thermoacoustic network model in such a way that again a state space model is retrieved. Due to the fact that the search for eigenvalues can be expressed by a linear eigenvalue problem, very fast standard algorithms can be used for the computation. This is in sharp contrast to the traditional thermoa- coustic network modeling in frequency domain, where a nonlinear eigenvalue problem needs to be solved. But even more importantly, it is clearing up the thermoacoustic nomenclature and modeling paradigms to a point, where fundamental insights become simple and obvious. The models can be simulated in time domain and may be coupled with compressible and incom- pressible LES of ﬂames. This has been exploited by Jaensch et al in order to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of ﬂames. The third paper establishes a link between sound power ampliﬁcation of premixed ﬂames and a formal stability criterion for individual parts of a system called the small gain theo- rem. In the thermoacoustic community, the stability criterion is known asinstability potentiality whereas in the acoustic community it is called whistling potential. Intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback has been identiﬁed as the most important cause for sound power ampliﬁcation in pre- mixed ﬂames. Eventually an algorithm to discriminate between eigenmodes of a full combustion system that originate from acoustic modes versus those that are constituted by burner & ﬂame intrinsic feedback has been developed and published in the third paper. The theory in the paper is presented using a classical frequency domain approach even though the idea was developed by investigating state space systems as shown in section 4. This choice was made in favor of pro- moting the idea of intrinsic feedback in the thermoacoustic community, where the classical fre- quency domain methods are more common. The fact that intrinsic thermoacoustic eigenmodes exist in full combustion systems leads to several fundamental insights and a paradigm change in the theory of combustion instabilities. The total number of eigenmodes of a thermoacoustic sys- tem is greater than just the number of acoustic cavity modes. Even though most thermoacoustic models contain by design implicitly the effect of intrinsic feedback, the common theories of combustion instability are based on the assumption, that some acoustic eigenmode becomes un- Summary of Achievements stable due to the driving by the ﬂame. In fact it may just as well be an intrinsic eigenmode of the burner & ﬂame that becomes unstable and to increase acoustic dissipation may even deteriorate the stability of the combustion system. 5.01 Linear State Space Network Modeling of Acoustic Sys- tems Abstract: Linear acoustic network models are a state of the art tool to cope with the complex- ity of large acoustic systems. Such systems are composed by a set of interconnected acoustic subsystems. We introduce a generalized linear modeling framework for acoustic systems that is based on a state space formalism and linear system theory. In order to enable the modeling of large acoustic network systems, the framework is taking into account the sparse structure of acoustic models. It is shown how acoustic models retrieved from 1 D low order modeling, 3 D linearized perturbation equations as well as computational ﬂuid dynamics or experimental data can be translated into state space models. This translation does not involve any approximations beyond those made by the acoustic modeling in the ﬁrst place. An algorithm to evaluate the in- terconnection of state space models is presented, which results in one single state space model for the connected acoustic network system. In order to compute the eigenvalues and vectors of a state space model, a standard or generalized linear eigenvalue problem needs to be solved. For large acoustic systems an efﬁcient iterative eigenvalue solver is required. The methods are validated by the comparison of eigenmodes of a generic annular combustor test case with non trivial topology. Contribution: I have reverse engineered and implemented the connection methods and de- veloped 1 D acoustic models, performed the 1 D analysis and lead the process to compose the manuscript.

The ﬂame and its immediate vicinity are resolved with reactive ﬂow simulations. Simultaneously, the acoustic ﬁeld is modeled with low-order models, which are coupled to the reactive ﬂow simulations. On the one hand a ﬂame model based on the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. Here, the sim- ulation is coupled to the low-order model via the characteristic wave amplitudes at the inlet boundary. The other model resolves the ﬂame with a low Mach number reactive ﬂow simula- 5.03 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames tion. In order to include thermoacoustic feedback, this ﬂame model is coupled with an acoustic network model by the global heat release rate and the ﬂuctuation of the axial velocity at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame. A bifurcation analysis using the plenum length as bi- furcation parameter is conducted. Both models exhibit complex nonlinear oscillations and are in good agreement with each other. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling of a linear acoustic model and a nonlinear ﬂame model via reference velocity and global heat release rate is suf- ﬁcient to accurately capture thermoacoustic oscillations of the conﬁguration investigated. This implies that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects and the ﬂame kinematics. Additionally, the study provides further evidence that premixed ﬂames respond predominantly to ﬂuctuations of the upstream velocity.

A causal representation of the ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions reveals a ﬂame-intrinsic feedback mechanism. The feedback loop may be described as follows: An upstream velocity disturbance induces a modulation of the heat release rate, which in turn generates an acoustic wave traveling in the upstream direction, where it inﬂuences the acoustic velocity and thus closes the feedback loop. The resonances of this feedback dynamics, which are identiﬁed as intrinsic eigenmodes of the ﬂame, have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of the combustion pro- cess in general and the ﬂame in particular. It is found that the ampliﬁcation of acoustic power by ﬂame-acoustic interactions can reach very high levels at frequencies close to the intrinsic eigen- values due to the ﬂame-internal feedback mechanism. This is shown rigorously by evaluating the ”instability potentiality” from a balance of acoustic energy ﬂuxes across the ﬂame. One obtains factors of maximum (as well as minimum) power ampliﬁcation. Based on the acous- tic energy ampliﬁcation, the small gain theorem is introduced as a stability criterion for the combustion system. It allows to formulate an optimization criterion for the acoustic character- istics of burners or ﬂames without regard of the boundary conditions offered by combustor or plenum. The concepts and methods are exempliﬁed ﬁrst with a simplistic n- τ model and then with a ﬂame transfer function that is representative of turbulent swirl burners.

Unsteady heat release generates acoustic waves that travel back from the ﬂame to the burner mouth, where they modulate the velocity and thereby close an intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop. The present paper demonstrates that corresponding ITA eigenmodes are in general important for the dynamics and stability of premixed combustion systems. It is shown that the complete set of eigenmodes of a combustor test rig should be interpreted as the sum of acoustic and ITA eigenmodes. A procedure is presented which allows to distinguish between eigenmodes that may be considered as acoustic modes driven by the ﬂame, versus those resulting from ITA feedback (but inﬂuenced by the acoustic properties of the combustor). This procedure is based on a factorization of the dispersion relation of the thermoacoustic model. Differences between the acoustic and intrinsic eigenmodes of a combustor test rig, in particular the corresponding mode shapes, are discussed. The paradoxical observation that increased acoustic losses at the boundaries may destabilize a combustion system is explained as an instability of the dominant ITA mode. Contribution: I have developed the theory for the separation of acoustic and ITA modes, im- plemented the methods, constructed the models, performed the analysis and lead the process to compose the the manuscript.

In analogy to the intrinsic feedback that was found for perfectly premixed ﬂames, it is to be expected, that there are intrinsic eigenfre- quencies associated with technically premixed ﬂames and a feedback with the injection system. Further extending the scope, even more complex network interactions and feedbacks such as swirl ﬂuctuations and acoustic scattering from entropy waves will need to be considered. As the intrinsic feedback is independent of the combustion chamber geometry, there should exist similar interactions in 3 D annular and canned combustors. The assumption of compact ﬂames and velocity sensitivity is valid even for moderately low frequency azimuthal eigen- modes in annular geometries. Then the propagation of acoustic waves inside the burner tubes is still expected to be plane. Models retrieved from FEM of 3 D linearized PDEs of perturbations equations are very large but sparse. In this case, it is possible to reduce them using standard (modal) or advanced (Krylov subspace) model order reduction techniques. This is particularly useful for the computation of parameter studies, where different ﬂame models shall be compared with respect to the same acoustic system. It is possible to couple a 3 D linear acoustic model of an annular combustor with nonlinear ﬂame simulations. The ﬂames may be incompressible LES simulations, whereas the acoustic model may be a model order reduced FEM model. By doing so, it could be possible to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of such systems with unprecedented numerical efﬁciency. In order to further increase the computational efﬁciency of nonlinear ﬂame simulations, reduced order ﬂame models need to be constructed. One possible path would be to optimize the param- eters of an under resolved LES simulation in order to match an expensive high ﬁdelity LES. Advanced machine learning techniques like boosting and bagging with multiple LES (e.g. differently anchored ﬂames) and support vector machines, kernel PCA or neuronal networks can be applied to optimize the residuals of the low order nonlinear Flame model.

Such systems are composed by a set of interconnected acoustic subsystems. We introduce a generalized linear modeling framework for acoustic systems that is based on a state space formalism and linear system theory. In order to enable the modeling of large acoustic network systems, the framework is taking into account the sparse structure of acoustic models. It is shown how acoustic models retrieved from 1 D low order modeling, 3 D linearized perturbation equations as well as computational ﬂuid dynamics or experimental data can be translated into state space models. This translation does not involve any approximations beyond those made by the acoustic modeling in the ﬁrst place. An algorithm to evaluate the interconnection of state space models is presented, which results in one single state space model for the connected acoustic network system. In order to compute the eigenvalues and vectors of a state space model, a standard or generalized linear eigenvalue problem needs to be solved. For large acoustic systems an eﬃcient iterative eigenvalue solver is required. The methods are validated by the comparison of eigenmodes of a generic annular combustor test case with non trivial topology. PACS no. 43.

Introduction Prediction and optimization of generation, propaga- tion and attenuation of sound and aero- and ther- moacoustic stability, is an important objective in the development of many applications like gas turbines or HVAC systems. Typically such systems are of con- siderable spatial extent but involve small scale phe- nomena like turbulence or combustion. This causes a need for very detailed models with complex physics in large domains. Therefore the simulation of mod- els derived from ﬁrst principles is very expensive even though the propagation of acoustic waves may still be modeled linear. A strategy to cope with this modeling complexity is to divide the entire system into several intercon- nected parts. Linear models of the acoustic dynamics of the diﬀerent parts of the system are retrieved using suitable methods according to complexity and phys- ical phenomena involved. In the simplest case, there are low order models assuming 1 D plane wave propa- gation, which may be solved analytically. Such mod- els are either algebraic relations due to acoustically compact discontinuities in area and temperature or (linear) Green’s functions of ducts. If the prop- agation of acoustic waves is not one dimensional, but © S. Hirzel Verlag· EAA 1 Reproduction of Papers ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 the mean ﬂow is still unaﬀected by acoustic pertur- bations, CAA tools can be used to retrieve acoustic models of the domain. Such tools model the acoustic dynamics by 2 D or 3 D linearized partial diﬀerential equations (e.g. Helmholtz, LEE, APE, LNSE) against the background of a given mean ﬁeld. In case of two way interactions between mean ﬂow and acoustic perturbations, a full LES computation or an exper- iment are needed. Linearized models of the acoustic dynamics are then inferred from time series data by system identiﬁcation or ﬁtting polynomials to the frequency responses of the system. The resulting set of interconnected linear models may be called a linear acoustic network model. Such network models are state of the art and have proven to predict the dynamics of acoustic systems. Typically those models are either coupled in time domain and simultaneously but segregatedly simulated or in frequency domain by individual evaluation and mul- tiplicative coupling [7–11]. Here we present the application of linear system theory and uniﬁed state space modeling to acoustic network systems. The generic state space structure enables us to incorporate models of varying modeling depth. This comprises 1 D low order models as well as models retrieved from linearized PDEs on complex geometries or even data driven models from LES or experiments. In addition, multi physics modeling is easily incorporated in the framework by means of for example ﬂame transfer functions for combustion pro- cesses or active control. As we will show, the state space modeling is numerically very eﬃcient as it is based on matrices with constant, frequency indepen- dent coeﬃcients. Therefore the search for eigenvalues is a standard or generalized linear eigenvalue problem. For small models, it is possible to directly solve for all eigenvalues. The eﬃcient computation of eigenvalues of large models requires an iterative algorithm. The concept is introduced using a minimal example of the 1 D scattering matrix of a duct section. Sub- sequently we show how all kinds of linear acoustic models can be translated into state space formula- tion.Thistranslationdoesnotinvolveanyapproxima- tion beyond those already made by the linear acoustic modeling. All methods and algorithms are publicly available by a (thermo-) acoustic network modeling framework called ta X. Based on the uniﬁed modeling, we demonstrate an algorithm for the interconnection of state space mod- els, which results in a single joint state space model. Similar algorithms are implemented by Matlab and Octave control toolboxes. In contrast to those, our im- plementation takes advantage of the sparse structure of acoustic models, which makes possible the solution of very large acoustic network systems. The concept is illustrated using a minimal example of two duct sec- tions. Subsequently, a generalized state space model interconnection algorithm is presented. As the resulting interconnected network model is again a state space model, the eigenvalues and vectors can be determined by solving a standard or general- ized linear eigenvalue problem. We present a memory and time eﬃcient iterative eigenvalue solver based on a direct method for the LU decomposition and an Arnoldi algorithm. Eventually the modeling strategy developed is ap- plied to a cavity problem, where two cylinders are connected by multiple tubes. The cylinders are mod- eled using 3 D linearized PDEs, whereas the ducts are modeled by a low order 1 D model. Results are val- idated with a CAA model where the entire system including the ducts is modeled by linearized PDEs. 2. State Space Modeling Acoustic network systems are composed of intercon- nected subsystems called elements. These individual subsystems are modeling internal sources of acoustic waves and how incident waves are transmitted and reﬂected in between its interfaces. Sources of acous- tic waves are for example aero- acoustic noise due to turbulence or actuators like loudspeakers. We are assuming that on the interfaces between the subsystems only plane waves are propagating, whereas inside of the subsystems arbitrary e.g. 3 D wave propagation is possible. This assumption is valid if the wave length of the highest frequency of interest is large compared to the diameter of the interface. The models that describe the scattering of acous- tic waves are typically characterized by frequency re- sponses of the scattering matrix or transfer matrix. The scattering matrix is relating incident and emitted characteristic wave amplitudes, whereas the transfer matrix is relating pressure and velocity perturbation amplitudes at the diﬀerent interfaces of the system. It is important to note that in system theory one dis- tinguishes the frequency responses from the subsys- tem models. Frequency responses are not models but rather the results of the models evaluated at discrete frequencies.Lineardynamicmodelsaredescribedbya set of ordinary diﬀerential equations relating inputsu (e.g. incident acoustic waves) and outputsy (emitted acoustic waves).

Discretized duct section. sources can be translated into a state space formu- lation. At ﬁrst, a minimal example of a 1 D duct is provided in order to motivate and introduce the state space models. Following this, we generalize the re- sult to models retrieved from linearized PDEs. Sub- sequently, we indicate how state space models are re- trieved from experimental or LES data. Eventually, an algorithm to compute the eigenval- ues of large sparse state space systems is presented. 2.01. Minimal Example 1 D SS Duct Model Acoustic wave propagation in a duct is in the simplest case governed by a 1 D Helmholtz equation c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 = ∂2 p′ ∂x 2. (4) The solution can be written as the superposition of characteristic waves p′(x,t) ρc = f ( t−x c ) +g ( t+ x c ); u′= f−g.(5) The propagation of the characterisic wave amplitudes f and g is described by an advection equation ∂f ∂t = 1 c ∂f ∂x; ∂g ∂t = −1 c ∂g ∂x (6) The Laplace transform of the analytic solution of the spatial integral over a duct of length L with non- reﬂecting boundary conditions is known as the scat- tering matrix [gu(s) fd(s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ e−sτ 0 ]    Scattering matrix S(s) [fu(s) gd(s) ]. (7) During time τ = L/c, the waves travel through the duct. The formulation is using the Laplace variable s= jω+ σ with the angular frequencyω and growth rate σ. Instead of analytically integrating the propagation of the characteristic waves, we can spatially discretize the PDE with a ﬁrst order upwind scheme to obtain an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE) dfj dt = cfj −fj−1 ∆x.

By in- creasing the spatial resolution, the discretized models approach the analytical solution for yet higher fre- quencies. Reproduction of Papers ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 2.02. Generalization to Linearized Fields of Perturbation Equations Instead of modeling acoustic propagation by 1 D Helmholtz equations as in the previous section, var- ious 2 D or 3 D linearized PDEs (LEE, LNSE, APE, reactive LNSE) may be considered. This gives the op- portunity to incorporate complex geometry, the ef- fects of mean ﬂow, dissipation and even acoustic- vortex interaction with all its advantages and issues. As demonstrated above, the partial diﬀerential equation may be spatially discretized using a ﬁnite volume or ﬁnite element method, which results in a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. On the interfaces, boundary conditions need to be imple- mented, which excite and receive plane waves. This is achieved by averaging across the surface of the in- terface and to excite for instance either p’ or the inci- dent wave and to measure the remaining free variable u’ or the outgoing wave. Depending on the discretiza- tionscheme,thetranslationtostatespaceformulation may require a so called mass or descriptor matrix E: E˙x= Ax+ Bu (13) y= Cx+ Du. However this translation to state space formulation is achieved just by a rearrangement of the system of equations. Most notably it does not introduce any ap- proximationotherthantheonesmadebychoosingthe type of PDE and the discretization scheme. As the relation between the statesx and the ﬁeld variables on the computational grid are known, the state vector of such models may be interpreted phys- ically and visualized. The procedure of deﬁning the perturbation equa- tions, geometry, boundary conditions, grid and dis- cretization scheme may be supported by tools like free FEM or COMSOL Multiphysics. COMSOL is fa- cilitatingtheprocessbyprovidingadefaultsetof LEE and LNSE equations, as well as an export interface to directly obtain the state space matrices A,B,C,D,E. Note that there are alternative methods to create state space systems from the eigenmodes of a lin- earized ﬁeld system. However this method is a reduced order approximation of the original ﬁeld based system, whereas the direct method presented above is not. 2.03. Application to Experimental and LES Data Instead of deriving acoustic models directly from lin- earized PDEs, they may be given in form of scattering or transfer matrices. Such models may for instance be derived from experiment using the multi-microphone method. Typically harmonic excitation is used and the time series of acoustic waves up- and downstream of the system are measured. Subsequently, polynomi- als are ﬁtted to the measured frequency response. When carrying out LES computations, it is more convenient to excite the system with broadband acoustic perturbations, as this reduces the necessary computational time compared to harmonic forcing. Discrete time models are inferred by system identiﬁ- cation from the input and output time series of the system. Eventually, the discrete time models can be transformed to continuous time. For a system with two interfaces (upstream, down- stream) this is expressed by either the scattering ma- trix S or the transfer matrix T [ gu(s) fd(s) ] = [ S 11(s) S 12(s) S 21(s) S 22(s) ][ fu(s) gd(s) ] (14) [p′ u(s) u′ u(s) ] = [T 11(s) T 12(s) T 21(s) T 22(s) ][p′ d(s) u′ d(s) ]. (15) In this case, the transfer functions G = Sij,Tij be- tween either incident, emitted waves or pressure, ve- locity perturbations at the interfaces of the system are known. In general, each transfer function G(s) may be represented as a rational polynomial ins, which re- lates the corresponding input variableuand the out- put y: y(s) =G(s)u(s); (16) G(s) = bnsn +. + b 1 s+ b 0 sm + am−1 sm−1 +. + a 1 s+ a 0, (17) and corresponds to a linear diﬀerential equation in time: dmy(t) dtm + am−1 dm−1 y(t) dtm−1 +. + a 1 ˙y(t) + a 0 y(t) = bn dnu(t) dtn +. + b 1 ˙u(t) + b 0 u(t). (18) All transfer functions G(s) can be translated into state space models (Eq. (25) in, ): ˙x=   0 1. 0 1 −a 0 −a 1. −am−1  x+  .  u (19) y= [ b 0−bna 0, b 1−bna 1, bn−1−bnam−1 ] x+ bnu. However, compared with the linearized PDE based models, these state space models do not establish a direct relation between acoustic perturbations inside the domain and the statex of the model. Therefore the state vector of such models cannot be physically interpreted or visualized. 2.04. Computation of Eigenvalues The eigenvalues and vectors of a state space system are computed by Laplace transformation of the sys- tem equation (13). Depending on whether E = I or not, a standard or generalized eigenvalue problem s Ex = Ax (20).1 Linear State Space Network Modeling of Acoustic Systems ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 needs to be solved. The procedure to do so for large, sparse systems is the shift and invert method in com- bination with an Arnoldi algorithm. It involves an LU decomposition of the matrix pencil A−so E at a shift frequency so. As this decomposition involves just con- stant coeﬃcients, it needs to be performed only once. This is a fundamental diﬀerence compared to other acoustic network codes, where the system matrices are functions of the frequency. Subsequently the im- plicitly restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM) is executed using arpack in order to retrieve eigenvalues and vectors close the the shift frequency. The LU decom- position is the bottleneck of the computation. There- foreweperformthisdecompositionusingthe MUMPS algorithm, which is very eﬃcient for large sparse systems resulting from the FEM discretization of lin- earized PDEs. The computation of ﬁve eigenvalues around one shift frequency for the model in section 4 of order 10 ×105 takes about 38 s and 1.05 GB of RAM on a workstation. For comparison, the Matlab eigs() com- mand is more than 6.05 times slower (248 s) and needs 4.03 times more ram (6.05 GB). The same computation for the full model in section 4 of order 15 ×105 takes about 180 s and 4.02 GB of RAM whereas the Matlab eigs() command takes more than 28 GB and runs out of memory after 15 min. 3. Interconnection of Acoustic Net- work Models As shown in the previous section, duct acoustic sys- tems can be modeled by a set of interconnected state space models. In this section we will demonstrate how the interconnections of the state space models can be evaluated to retrieve one joint state space model. Such algorithms are provided by the control toolboxes of Matlab and Octave. Both are based on full matrices, which restricts them to small systems due to memory restrictions. Therefore we have re-implemented the functionality in a sparse state space toolbox, which is able to exploit the sparse structure of acoustic net- work systems and is part of tax. 3.01. Minimal Example Connection of Two Duct Sections In order to motivate and illustrate the algorithm to connect two state space models, the previous mini- mal example is revisited. We demonstrate the inter- connection of two identical duct sections of half the length L′= L/2 of the minimal example as depicted in Fig. 3. At ﬁrst, the analytical solution and then the state space connection are shown. fu fd 1 2 3 4 5 fi Figure 3. Connected duct sections. The analytic solution for the scattering matrices of the two duct sections are according to Eq. (7) [gu(s) fi(s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ/2 e−sτ/2 0 ][fu(s) gi(s) ]; (21) [gi(s) fd(s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ/2 e−sτ/2 0 ][fi(s) gd(s) ] (22) with the intermediate state i. The system of equa- tions needs to be solved for the input output dynam- ics between upstream and downstream position, by eliminating the internal state. This is achieved by a linear fractional transformation called the Redheﬀer star product : S = Su ⋆Sd. (23) The resulting scattering matrix in the special case of connected ducts with zeros on the diagonal entries [gu(s) fd(s) ] = [ 0 e−sτ e−sτ 0 ][fu(s) gd(s) ] (24) is exactly the same as the one for the original minimal example in Eq. (7). Now the interconnection of state space models is considered. The coeﬃcients of the f-wave propagation of the two discretized duct section state space models are identical: ∂ ∂t [f 2 f 3 ] = [a 0 −a a ][f 2 f 3 ] + [−a ][fu ] (25) [fi ] = [0 1][f 2 f 3 ] + fu (26) ∂ ∂t [f 4 f 5 ] = [a 0 −a a ][f 4 f 5 ] + [−a ][fi ] (27) [fd ] = [0 1][f 4 f 5 ] + fi. (28) We can block diagonally append the two systems ∂ ∂t   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  =   a 0 0 0 −a a 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 −a a     f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  +   −a 0 0 0 0 −a 0 0   [fu fi ] (29) [fi fd ] = [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  + fu (30) Reproduction of Papers ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 and the intermediatefi wave appears as an input and as well as an output of the appended system.

(10) is obtained: ∂ ∂t   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  =   a 0 0 0 −a a 0 0 0 −a a 0 0 0 −a a     f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  +   −a   [fu ] (32) [fd ] = [0 0 0 1 ]   f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5  + fu This way to solve for the interconnected state space model can be generalized to arbitrary interconnec- tions of state space systems, which is the subject of the following section. 3.02. Interconnection of SS Models The connection of multiple state space systems can be achieved by a three step procedure. At ﬁrst all sub- systems are appended. Then the interconnections are evaluated and a feedback equation is formulated. Fi- nallythefeedbackequationiseliminatedandthestate space model of the interconnected system is retrieved. 3.02.01. Appending of SS Models State space systems are appended by the block diago- nal collection of the system matrices Ai,Bi,Ci,Di,Ei of each of the state space modelsi = 1,2,n.

(34) 3.02.02. Evaluation of Feedback The input of the appended system˜u consists of true external inputs u and internal feedbacks˜y. External inputs of the connected system are for example noise sources or perturbations at plane wave interfaces that are not connected internally like fu in Eq. (32) of the previous example. The internal feedbacks are due to the plane wave connections between the appended models. For example waves that are leaving one ele- ment model˜yj enter another element model˜uk. This is expressed by a feedback matrix F that contains bi- nary (0,1) entries corresponding to the topology of the network. ˜u= F˜y+ u (35) The feedback matrix is retrieved by evaluating the names which are assigned to the inputs and outputs of the appended system. 3.02.03. Solve for the Connected SS Model Using the feedback equation (35), the connected sys- tem is expressed by ˜E˙x= ˜Ax+ ˜B˜u (36) ˜y= ˜Cx+ ˜D˜u (37) ˜u= F˜y+ u. (38) Inordertoobtainastatespacemodelwiththegeneric structure as in Eq. (13), the feedback equation needs to be eliminated. This is achieved by replacing˜y in the feedback equation (38) using the output equation (37) and then solve for˜u ˜u= (1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜Cx+ (1 −F ˜D)−1 u. (39) Subsequently ˜ucan be eliminated in the system equa- tion (36) and the output equation (37) and the state space system matrices of the connected system are: A= ˜A+ ˜B(1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜C; B = ˜B(1 −F ˜D)−1; C = ˜C+ ˜D(1 −F ˜D)−1 F ˜C; D= ˜D(1 −F ˜D)−1; E = ˜E. Eventually, the internally connected outputs in˜y can be dropped, such that only the relevant outputs y remain. Thus the connected state space model has the generic form E˙x= Ax+ Bu y= Cx+ Du.1 Linear State Space Network Modeling of Acoustic Systems ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 a b f gp' u' p' u' 1 2 Figure 4. Interconnection of incompatible system inter- faces (a,b) by Connectors (1,2). 3.02.04. Invertibility of Feedback Evaluating the feedback needs an inversion of 1−F ˜D. This operation is typically very cheap as both F and ˜D are very sparse. In fact F ˜D only has non zero entries, where a feed through (˜D) is internally con- nected. Such a feed through occurs in low order mod- els of acoustically compact elements, like duct singu- larities such as discontinuities in area or temperature, and at plane wave boundary interfaces which are de- ﬁned in primitive variablesu′,p′. There are rare cases when the inversion is not possi- ble. This happens when there is a connection between two interfaces, which implicitly connect two inputs. If both systems (a,b) have for exampleu′ as an output and p′as an input, it is not possible to connect them directly. However, it is possible to convert the inter- face to wave amplitudesf,g on both sides, and sub- sequently connect the two systems as shown in Fig. 4. The connectors (1,2) represent algebraic relations, so- called \"feed through\"between inputs and outputs: [f p′ ] = [1 1 2 1 ][g u′ ]; [g p′ ] = [1 −1 2 −1 ][f u′ ]. (40) The connection of the converted interfaces leads to an algebraic equation linking two inputs (p′ a = p′ b), which results in a rank deﬁciency of 1 −F ˜D. The solution to this is to append the feed back equation (39) to the system equation (36), instead of inverting it. Then the state vector becomes˜x= [x ˜u]T and the resulting system matrices are: A= [ ˜A ˜B F ˜C F˜D−I ]; B = [0 I ] C = [˜C ˜D ]; D=; E = [˜E 0 0 0 ] (41) 4. Acoustic Eigenmodes of an Annular Combustor In order to demonstrate the functionality and eﬀec- tiveness of the connection algorithm, we consider an annular combustor geometry which was investigated by Evesque et.al. The system is shown in Fig. 5 and consists of an annular plenum (P) and combus- tion chamber (C), which are connected by 12 burner tubes (B). The geometrical parameters of the system are listed in Table I. The plenum and combustion chamber have equal middle radii Rand widthsδ. We Table I.

Geometry of the annular combustion system. consider a cold case of the combustion system, where there is no reaction or temperature gradients in the ﬁeld. Furthermore, low Mach number is assumed and mean ﬂow is neglected. We will investigate the system with two diﬀerent models. The ﬁrst model discretizes the entire system using linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) and an FEM scheme with the commercial tool Comsol 1. Especially the duct sections need to be highly reﬁned in order to avoid numerical issues in this area. The total order of the full system is 152547. The second model discretizes just the plenum and combustion chamber in Comsol and uses a 1 D third order up- wind scheme as introduced in the minimal example for the tubes. The length of the tubes is L= 0.013 m, speed of soundc = 350 m s−1 and the maximum fre- quency of interest is up tof = 400 Hz. Therefore, the non-dimensionalized frequency τω = 2πf L/c = 0.093 is within the range where the model is performing well (Fig. 2, ). The state space system matrices (A,B,C,D,E) of the plenum and combustion chamber submodels are exported from Comsol. Subsequently input and output names of the subsystems may ei- ther be manually assigned or the system is assembled using the graphical interface of ta X as shown in Fig. 6. Finallyall 12 ductmodelsofthetubesandtheplenum and combustion chamber models are connected with the algorithm presented in the previous section. The total order of the connected system is 136702, which is approximately 90% of the full model. Table II shows the ﬁrst four physical eigenvalues of the full model, which was entirely computed in Comsol (column\"Full\"), the eigenvalues computed by the connected system (column \"Connected\") and the eigenvalues reported by (column \"Evesque\"). We can see that there is very good agreement between the three computational models. The modeshapes of the second mode of the full and connected model are 1 https://www.comsol.de/ Reproduction of Papers ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA Vol. 98 Figure 6.

As the tube sections are not part of the Comsol mesh in the connected model, only the plenum and combustion chamber are shown there. The visualization of the pressures on the tube inter- faces of the connected model is not implemented, thus the patches appear dark. Other than that, the mode- shapes show very good agreement and we conclude that the connection algorithm is working well for state space models retrieved from linearized PDEs. 5. Conclusion The methods presented in this paper allow for a uni- ﬁed state space modeling of acoustic systems. This applies to models retrieved from analytical low order derivations, from linearized partial diﬀerential equa- tions for aero-acoustic ﬁeld variables and also from experimental or LES data. The respective translation to a generic state space formulation does not bring further approximations other than those introduced by the acoustic modeling in the ﬁrst place. This dis- tinguishes the procedure from methods that retrieve state space models from modal reduction techniques. There is a generic algorithm to connect networks of interconnected state space models that results in one joint state space model of the interconnected system. Due to the uniﬁed state space formulation, we can compute the eigenvalues and vectors of acoustic net- work models very eﬃciently by solving a standard or generalized linear eigenvalue problem. If one exploits the sparse structure of linear acoustic network mod- els and an iterative eigenvalue solver, even solving for very large models is possible. Therefore, we can determine stability, optimize us- ing adjoint eigenvectors, carry out parameter studies and perform uncertainty quantiﬁcation. Furthermore, power spectral density of noise emissions and acoustic wave scattering dynamics can be evaluated directly, without sampling, in frequency domain. At the same time, the simulation in time domain is possible, which is necessary for nonlinear simulations. For example limit cycles of a combustion test rig can be simulated by coupling a linear acoustic network model with an incompressible LES of the ﬂame. There are still some areas for improvements of this state space acoustic network modeling framework. In- stead of appending all inputs to the state vector if the feedback is not entirely invertible, it would be better to partially invert the feedback and append just the ones that may not be inverted. On behalf of the in- terfaces between subsystems it would be possible to resolve non-planar waves. Such higher order interfaces wouldenabletodividesystemsintosubsystemsevenif there are no acoustically compact regions for placing a planar-waveinterface.Furthermore,multiphysicssys- tems can be easily included. For example active ﬂow control can be incorporated into the network model directly by means of a sensor and actor model and a state space controller. 6. Acknowledgment Financial support for S.

The ﬂame and its immediate vicinity are resolved with reactive ﬂow simulations. Simulta- neously, the acoustic ﬁeld is modeled with low-order models, which are coupled to the reactive ﬂow simulations. On the one hand a ﬂame model based on the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations is investigated. Here, the simu- lation is coupled to the low-order model via the characteristic wave amplitudes at the inlet boundary. The other model resolves the ﬂame with a low Mach number reactive ﬂow simulation. In order to include thermoacoustic feedback, this ﬂame model is coupled with an acoustic network model by the global heat release rate and the ﬂuctuation of the axial velocity at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame. A bifurcation analysis using the plenum length as bifurcation parameter is conducted. Both models exhibit complex nonlinear oscillations and are in good agreement with each other. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling of a linear acoustic model and a nonlinear ﬂame model via reference velocity and global heat release rate is suﬃcient to accurately capture thermoacoustic oscillations of the conﬁguration investigated. This implies that the most important nonlinearities can be attributed to hydrodynamic e ﬀects and the ﬂame kinematics. Additionally, the study provides further evidence that premixed ﬂames respond predominantly to ﬂuctuations of the upstream velocity.

Introduction The development of gas turbines or rocket engines is often impeded by thermoacoustic instabilities. Feed- back between the unsteady heat release rate of the com- bustion and the acoustic ﬁeld results in very large os- cillations of pressure, heat release and velocity. These oscillations can reach amplitude levels at which gas tur- bines have to be shut down, or rockets are destroyed. To decide whether a thermoacoustic instability reaches such amplitude levels, nonlinear models are required. This modeling is a challenging task, as complex non- linear phenomena are involved. Durox et al studied the response of various laminar ﬂame conﬁgurations to ﬂuctuations of the inﬂow velocity. It was observed that the ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate saturate for high forcing amplitudes. Correspondingly, Kabiraj ∗Corresponding author Email address: polifke@tfd.mw.tum.de (W. Polifke) URL: http://www.tfd.mw.tum.de (W. Polifke) et al studied self-excited thermoacoustic oscilla- tions of a laminar ﬂame and observed periodic, aperi- odic, or chaotic oscillations as well as hysteresis. In order to obtain qualitative and quantitative agreement with these experimental results, a model of thermoa- coustic instabilities has to account for all e ﬀects ob- served. Dowling proposed to model the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics with a ﬂame describing function (FDF). Noiray et al showed that the FDF combined with an acoustic network model provides a useful estimate of limit cycle amplitudes in many cases. However, it is a frequency domain approach and considers only a single unstable acoustic mode. Therefore, it can only predict harmonic oscillations. The advantage of time-domain models is that they can account for multi-modal cou- pling, which is necessary to describe complex types of oscillations. A time-domain model that has enjoyed re- cent interest uses a G-equation based ﬂame model cou- pled with a low-order acoustic model [3, 5–7]. This model shows complex nonlinear oscillations. However, the results depend strongly on the velocity model used Preprint submitted to the 36 th Combustion Symposium May 19, 2016.2 Hybrid CFD/low-order modeling of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations fu ductrigid end gd LA L fu ductrigid end gd x non-reﬂective Fig. 1: Coupling of the fully compressible simulation and the corresponding acoustic model. (Model: C-fg). Indeed, the G-equation models found in the liter- ature do not account for vortex shedding or vortex-ﬂame interaction. Additionally, gas expansion and shear layer eﬀects were reported to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the ﬂame response. These e ﬀect are also not con- sidered by state-of-the art G-equation implementations. Therefore, quantitative agreement with experiment is not obtained and more sophisticated models are needed. A suitable low-order model has to account for the complex interaction between ﬂame, ﬂow and acoustics. In the present study we propose and compare two mod- els which account for these e ﬀects: Firstly, a model which resolves the ﬂame and its vicinity with a fully compressible, reactive ﬂow simulation. As shown in Fig. 1, the simulation is coupled to the acoustic low or- der model via the characteristic wave amplitudes in or- der to model the full acoustic ﬁeld of the plenum. In the following we denote this simulation “C-fg”. Secondly, a model which utilizes a low Mach number, reactive ﬂow simulation. Here, the density depends only on the tem- perature, but not on pressure. As shown in Fig. 2, this model is coupled to a low-order network model via a reference velocity and the global heat release rate. Con- sequently, we denote this model “LM-uq”. Please note that in the literature [11–14] other hy- brid models for thermoacoustic oscillations have been proposed. However, the coupling used by these hy- brid models has not been cross-validated in a systematic manner against a fully compressible simulation. This cross-validation allows to directly verify the coupling between ﬂame, hydrodynamics and acoustics. In the following section the two formulations are ex- plained in detail. Thereafter, in Section 3 the results of the two models are compared via a bifurcation analy- sis. Although, complex thermoacoustic oscillations are observed, the two models are in good agreement with each other. Thus it is concluded that the coupling of a nonlinear ﬂame model and a linear acoustic model is suﬃcient to describe the thermoacoustic oscillation of the conﬁguration investigated.

Kornilov et al and Duchaine et al investigated the linear dynamics of this conﬁguration by experiment and simulation, re- spectively. Good agreement between experimental and numerical results was found. The CFD setup used in the present work corresponds to the one used in. Only one half of one ﬂame is resolved within the two dimensional CFD domain and symmetry boundary con- ditions are used. The outlet BC is non-reﬂective. This corresponds to a ﬂame positioned in the middle of the burner plate. The inﬂuence of asymmetry on the nonlin- ear dynamics is expected to be complex and necessitates a separate study. At the inﬂow, we impose a mean ve- locity of 0.04 m/s and a temperature of 293 K. The plate on which the ﬂame is stabilized is modeled as no-slip wall with a ﬁxed temperature of 373 K as measured in. The fuel is methane with an equivalence ratio of 0.08. For a detailed description of the two-step reaction mechanism we refer to. As sketched in Fig. 3, a structured grid with 122300 cells was used. In the re- gion of the steady-state position of the ﬂame and of the area contractions, the grid is uniform with a cell size of 0.0025 mm. This corresponds to about 18 grid points in the reactive zone. Outside this region the cells were stretched in the axial direction. In order to model thermoacoustic instabilities of the conﬁguration correctly, it is crucial to capture the cou- pling between combustion, hydrodynamics and acous- tics. In this regard the treatment of the model C-fg and LM-uq diﬀers from each other.

Compressible simulation – plenum modeled via acoustic boundary conditions By its nature, the compressible simulation used by the model C-fg captures the coupling between com- bustion, hydrodynamics and acoustics. However, the plenum length L determines the acoustic impedance at the burner plate and thus, is crucial for the thermoa- coustic stability of the conﬁguration. In order to cap- ture thermoacoustic instabilities the full plenum length has to be modeled. The most straight-forward way to model the plenum is to resolve it within the CFD do- main. However, this approach has two important draw- backs: (1) The impedance at the inlet of the extended CFD domain can be imposed in a very limited manner, only. (2) Changing the length of the plenum requires to create a new mesh. In oder to overcome these draw- backs, in the present study Characteristic Based State- Space Boundary Conditions (CBSBC), as proposed in, are utilized to eﬀectively extend the plenum to the full plenum length (compare Fig. 1). CBSBC provide a robust and consistent implemen- tation of time-domain impedance boundary conditions. This BC allows to impose an impedance and ensures that the CFD simulation exhibits the impedance im- posed, accurately. CBSBC are based on a model of the reﬂection coeﬃcient which can be considered as equiv- alent to the acoustic impedance. The reﬂection coe ﬃ- cient has to be provided in state-space representation. We will ﬁrst explain how the state-space model for the present study is determined. Afterwards, we show how the model is coupled with the compressible CFD simu- lation. Plane acoustic waves can be described by means of the characteristic waves amplitudes f = 1 ( p′/¯ρ¯c + u′), g = 1 ( p′/¯ρ¯c −u′), (1) with density ¯ρ, speed of sound ¯ c. p′ and u′ are the acoustic pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations, respectively. f corresponds to the wave traveling in the downstream direction and g to the wave traveling in the upstream direction. The one-dimensional, linearized Euler equa- tions ∂f ∂t + (¯u + ¯c) ∂f ∂x = 0 and ∂g ∂t + (¯u −¯c) ∂g ∂x = 0, (2) describe the propagation of the acoustic wave ampli- tudes. At the inlet of the acoustic model the boundary condition u′(x = 0) = 0 ⇔f (x = 0) = g(x = 0), (3) models a rigid wall. At the outlet of the acoustic model the boundary condition g(t,x = LA) = gu(t) (4) allows to impose an arbitrary incoming wave gu(t). The discretization of Eq. (2) with a third-order upwind scheme in space under consideration of the boundary conditions (3) and (4) can be written in state-space form ˙x C-fg = AC-fgx C-fg + BC-fggu (5 a) fu = CC-fgx C-fg, (5 b) with the state-space matrices AC-fg,BC-fg and CC-fg and the state-vector x C-fg. The index “C-fg” emphasizes that the state space model belongs to the model C-fg. For a tutorial explanation of how these matrices can be deter- mined we refer to. The second step is to couple the model (5) with the CFD simulation. CBSBC extends the well- known Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary condi- tions (NSCBC). As in the NSCBC framework, CB- SBC deﬁne the derivative of pressure p and velocity u according to ∂p ∂t + 1 (L 5 + L 1 ) = 0, ∂u ∂t + 1 (L 5 −L 1 ) = 0. (6).2 Hybrid CFD/low-order modeling of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations Here, L 5 and L 1 are the temporal derivatives of the characteristic wave amplitudes f and g, respectively. With a setup as shown in Fig. 1, L 1 corresponds to the wave leaving the CFD domain and is given as L 1 = (u −c) (∂p ∂x −ρc∂u ∂x ). (7) L 5 corresponds to the f -wave entering the domain and has to be imposed L 5 = σ ( u −(fu −gd ) −u T ) + 2∂fu ∂t, (8) The term (fu −gd ) is equal to the acoustic velocity ﬂuctuation. Including this term in the relaxation term avoids artiﬁcial reﬂections at the boundaries of the CFD domain as it compensates the eﬀect of the acoustic ﬂuc- tuation on the relaxation term. The term ∂fu/∂t allows to impose an ingoing wave. Please note that equation (8) is equal to the formulation given in. Solving equations (5) to (8) at every time step al- lows to extend the acoustic domain to the full plenum length. Please note, by changing the length LA we can change the plenum length without the requirement of a new mesh. At the outlet of the compressible simulation we impose non-reﬂective boundary conditions as pro- posed in. The fully compressible simulations were conducted using A VBP 1 (Cerfacs and IFP). The Lax- Wendroﬀ scheme was used for the discretization. This scheme is second-order accurate in both time and space. The time step was set to ensure an acoustic CFL number of 0.07. 2.02. Low Mach number simulation – coupled to acous- tics via Rankine-Hugoniot The model LM-uq is based on a low Mach number simulation. This means that the density depends only on the temperature, but not on pressure. In this way acous- tic waves and hence, thermoacoustic feedback inside the CFD domain is suppressed. These kind of simulation is also called weakly compressible. In order to account for the thermoacoustic feedback, the low Mach number simulation is coupled with an acoustic network model via the linearized Rankine-Hugoniot equations for a compact heat source. As shown in Fig. 2, the network model and the low Mach number simulation are coupled via the global heat release rate ˙q′and a reference veloc- ity ure f. Please note, it can be shown that the coupling is equivalent to the one proposed by Moeck et al. 1 http://cerfacs.fr/en/computational-ﬂuid-dynamics-softwares/ As the acoustic model is linear it can be written in state space form ˙x LM−uq = ALM-uqx LM-uq + BLM-uq ˙q′ (9 a) ure f = CLM-uqx LM-uq + DLM−uq ˙q′ (9 b) With the state-space matrices ALM-uq, BLM-uq and, CLM-uq and the state-vector x LM-uq. Here, the index “LM-uq” emphasizes that the state space model belongs to the low Mach number simulation. A detailed descrip- tion of how these matrices may be formulated can be found in [21–23]. The elements of the network model are shown in Fig. 2. As for the C-fg case the duct sec- tions are modeled using the linearized Euler equations. The model for the area jump is based on the continuity equation and does not include acoustic losses. The inlet BC of the acoustic network model is a reﬂection coe ﬃ- cient of 1, which corresponds to a rigid wall. The outlet BC is a non-reﬂective boundary condition. The temper- ature ratio across the ﬂame is 6.1. Overfall, the same conﬁguration, shown in Fig. 3, as with the model C-fg is modeled. The Rankine-Hugoniot equations assumes that the ﬂame is compact with respect to the acoustic wave- length. Considering the height of the ﬂame of about 5 mm and the length of the plenum which is the char- acteristic dimension of the acoustics for longitudinal modes, varying between 200 mm and 1000 mm, this assumption is fulﬁlled with good accuracy. The ﬂame acts as an acoustic point source while the real ﬂame has some spacial extent. The exact position of this source is a model parameter. In the present study this position was chosen 2.06 mm after the burner plate. Additionally, it is assumed that the ﬂame responds only to ﬂuctua- tions of the reference velocity. Again, due to the spatial extent of the real ﬂame, the position at which this ref- erence velocity is extracted is a model parameter. As indicated in Fig. 2, two di ﬀerent positions were inves- tigated: (1) 15 mm upstream of the burner plate. This position coincides with the inlet boundary of the low Mach number simulation and is denoted as reference 0 (compare Fig. 2 and Tab. 1). (2) The reference velocity was chosen at the upstream side of the burner plate. In Fig. 2 and Tab. 1 this position is denoted as reference 1. The open-source ﬁnite volume code Open FOAM 2 was used as low Mach number CFD solver. For the temporal integration the implicit Euler scheme with a (hydrody- namic) CFL number of 0.3 was employed.

Numerical results The model settings for which self-excited thermoa- coustic instabilities were observed are listed in Tab. 1. Simulations with two di ﬀerent initial conditions were conducted. (1) The simulations denoted with “low” were started from a converged mean ﬁeld. Here, only a small initial acoustic excitation was applied. This speeds up the development of a thermoacoustic oscilla- tion and allows to reduce the computational costs sig- niﬁcantly. (2) The simulations denoted with “high” were started from a initial condition taken from a snap- shot with developed thermoacoustic oscillations. For all plenum length the same snapshot is used. The two dif- ferent reference positions for the model LM-uq were ex- plained in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 2. Depending on the complexity of the oscillations ob- served for each case, time series between 100 ms and 500 ms were generated. The ﬁrst part of the time se- ries at which the thermoacoustic oscillations are not yet fully developed were removed before the post process- ing. The two models were compared w.r.t. the normal- ized ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity: u′= ( u′ re f −¯u′ re f ) /¯u′ re f (10) Here, u′ re f is the area averaged velocity measured at a plane 15 mm upstream of the burner plate. ¯ u′ re f is the temporal average of u′ re f. In the remainder of this sec- tion the two models are ﬁrst compared via a bifurcation analysis. Thereafter, the cases with a plenum length of L = 200 mm and L = 700 mm are investigated in detail. 3.01. Bifurcation analysis In Fig. 4 (top) and Fig. 5 the variation of the root mean square (RMS) value with plenum length and the bifurcation diagram are shown, respectively. The am- plitudes predicted by the two models are in good agree- ment with each other. This holds in particular for short plenum lengths L. For long plenum lengths the ampli- tudes predicted by the model LM-uq are slightly lower than the amplitudes predicted by the model C-fg. The corresponding velocities yield a Reynolds number of about 1000. Thus, the ﬂow is in the transition to tur- bulence and better agreement cannot be expected. It is interesting to note that the simulations with and without initial perturbation yield the same thermoacous- tic oscillations. In contrast to experiments hys- teresis is not observed. Several possible reasons can be named: E.g. the assumption of symmetry, the neglect of conjugate heat transfer, (unsteady) uncertainties in the boundary conditions and the ﬂow properties. How- ever, also G-equation based models predict hysteresis, qualitatively. Therefore, the most likely reasons why the models proposed in the present study do not show hys- teresis are: (1) The ﬂame considered in the present study is very small. As shown in Fig. 3, the ﬂame height is only 4.07 mm. This reduces the size of the computational domain and thus, the computational costs, signiﬁcantly. However, the ﬂame wrinkling is reduced which can pre- vent hysteresis to occur. (2) In and a Rijke tube conﬁguration was investigated. Both acoustic boundary conditions of these conﬁgurations are open ends. This is in contrast to the closed end -non-reﬂective BC in- vestigated in the present study. This changes the shape of the acoustic modes in the conﬁguration, which again may prevent hysteresis to occur. Another interesting point is the onset of the ther- moacoustic oscillations. It is observed that the model C-fg and the LM-uq with reference position 1 (com- pare Fig. 2) become unstable at a plenum length of L = 160 mm. The models LM-uq with reference po- sition 0, however, exhibit a thermoacoustic instability starting at a plenum length of 170 mm. Therefore, the less intuitive coupling using a reference position which is right before the burner plate is more accurate than the coupling using a reference position that coincides with the inlet boundary of the low Mach number simulation. The reason is that due to the low Mach number formu- lation, a velocity ﬂuctuation imposed at the inlet will act immediately on the whole CFD domain. Therefore, the reference position should be chosen at the location where acoustic ﬂuctuations create hydrodynamic ﬂuc- tuations, which in general does not coincide with the position of the inlet of the CFD domain. In Fig. 5 bifurcation diagrams of the two models are shown. In Fig. 4 (bottom) the dominant frequencies fu predicted with the di ﬀerent setups investigated are.2 Hybrid CFD/low-order modeling of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 10 u′ rms [−] 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 1 L [m] fu [Hz] Fig. 4: RMS (top) and dominant frequency (bottom) of the reference velocity for diﬀerent plenum length. : LM-uq- low-0, : LM-uq-high-0, : LM-uq-high-1, : C-fg-low, : C-fg-high shown. The comparison shows that also the nature of the oscillations predicted by the two models is in good agreement with each other. A signiﬁcant di ﬀerence is observed at a plenum length of L = 500 mm. 3.02. Comparison of time series In Fig. 6 the time series (top plots) and the power spectrum (bottom plots) of the unsteady velocity for a plenum length of 200 mm and 700 mm are shown. Both plots show that the simulations are in good agreement which each other. Consistent with the bifurcation dia- gram, the amplitude at a plenum length of 700 mm is signiﬁcantly larger than the amplitude at L = 200 mm. In the power spectrum for L = 700 mm a noise content is observed, which can be attributed to the onset of turbu- lence due to the high oscillation amplitudes. The corre- sponding maximum Reynolds number observed inside the slit of the burner plate is about 1000. The oscillation observed can be categorized as period-2 oscillations at L = 200 mm and limit cycle oscillations at L = 700 mm. 4. Summary and Conclusion Two nonlinear, time-domain models of self-excited thermoacoustic instabilities of a laminar premixed ﬂame (see Fig. 3) were proposed and compared: On the one hand the model C-fg shown in Fig. 1 resolves the ﬂame with a fully compressible and reactive simulation. A low-order model of the plenum of the burner is coupled to the simulation via the characteristic wave amplitudes. This allows to change the length of the plenum without modifying the computational grid.

The black dots show the result obtained with C-fg-low and C-fg- high and the gray dots the one obtained with LM-uq-low-0 and LM-uq-high-0 the model LM-uq (see Fig. 2) uses a low Mach num- ber formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations to de- scribe the ﬂame dynamics. In order to account for the thermoacoustic feedback this simulation is coupled to an acoustic network model. Here, the coupling is based on the Rankine-Hugoniot equations and uses a reference velocity measured upstream of the ﬂame and the global heat release rate. A bifurcation analysis with the plenum length as bi- furcation parameter was conducted. The two models were in good agreement with each other. The compress- ible simulation on which the model C-fg is based on re- solves the ﬂame acoustic interaction, possible nonlinear scattering of acoustic waves and hydrodynamic e ﬀects. On the other hand, the low Mach number simulation uti- lized by the model LM-uq, suppresses all acoustic ef- fects inside the CFD domain. Thus, in this model the acoustic is acting on the ﬂame only via ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity. As the bifurcation analysis shows good agreement of the two models, we conclude that the ﬂame investigated indeed responds predominantly to ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity. This holds even while the ﬂame exhibits complex thermoacoustic oscil- lations. Consequently, the acoustic pressure and acous- tic waves act on the ﬂame only indirectly, as they cause ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity. This sequence of cause and e ﬀect has been questioned in the context of the recent discussion on the intrinsic thermoacoustic Reproduction of Papers 160 170 180 190 −1 t [ms] u′(t) 100 120 140 160 180 200 −5 t [ms] 0 200 60010−1 f [Hz] ⏐⏐⏐U( f ) ⏐⏐⏐ 0 200 60010−1 f [Hz] Fig. 6: Time series (top), power spectrum (bottom) of the ve- locity signal for L = 200 mm (left) and L = 700 mm (right).

Furthermore, the comparison shows that the nonlinearities observed can be attributed to hy- drodynamic eﬀects or to the ﬂame kinematics. The models investigated in the present study form a basis for further research. On the one hand the two mod- els can be extended in a straightforward manner, in or- der to account for e ﬀects like for conjugate heat trans- fer or for three dimensional e ﬀects. This is expected to be necessary in order to obtain models which reproduce experimental results, quantitatively. Here, the most crit- ical limitations are that both models are restricted to the low-frequency regime and that the model LM-uq is valid only for velocity sensitive heat sources. On the other hand the models can serve as reference for non- linear reduced-order models for the dynamics of lam- inar ﬂames. Furthermore, both coupling methods also work with LES and therefore, allow a detailed numer- ical study of thermoacoustic oscillations of turbulent ﬂames. This is of signiﬁcant applied interest and will be subject of future investigations. 5. Acknowledgment The ﬁnancial support for S.

Reproduction of Papers Intrinsic thermoacoustic instability of premixed ﬂames Thomas Emmert, Sebastian Bomberg, Wolfgang Polifke⇑ Lehrstuhl für Thermodynamik, Technische Universität München, D-85747 Garching, Germany article info Article history: Received 31 October 2013 Received in revised form 31 January 2014 Accepted 4 June 2014 Available online 4 August 2014 Keywords: Intrinsic instability Premixed ﬂame Acoustic energy Thermoacoustics Frequency response Combustion dynamics abstract The thermoacoustic stability of velocity sensitive premixed ﬂames is investigated. A causal representation of the ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions reveals a ﬂame-intrinsic feedback mechanism. The feedback loop may be described as follows: An upstream velocity disturbance induces a modulation of the heat release rate, which in turn generates an acoustic wave traveling in the upstream direction, where it inﬂuences the acoustic velocity and thus closes the feedback loop. The resonances of this feedback dynamics, which are identiﬁed asintrinsic eigenmodesof the ﬂame, have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of the combustion process in general and the ﬂame in particular. It is found that the ampliﬁcation of acous- tic power by ﬂame-acoustic interactions can reach very high levels at frequencies close to the intrinsic eigenvalues due to the ﬂame-internal feedback mechanism. This is shown rigorously by evaluating the ‘‘instability potentiality’’ from a balance of acoustic energy ﬂuxes across the ﬂame. One obtains factors of maximum (as well as minimum) power ampliﬁcation. Based on the acoustic energy ampliﬁcation, the small gain theorem is introduced as a stability criterion for the combustion system. It allows to formu- late an optimization criterion for the acoustic characteristics of burners or ﬂames without regard of the boundary conditions offered by combustor or plenum. The concepts and methods are exempliﬁed ﬁrst with a simplisticn /C 0 s model and then with a ﬂame transfer function that is representative of turbulent swirl burners. /C 2112014 The Combustion Institute.

Introduction The dynamics and stability of ﬂames are fascinating and multi- faceted phenomena, which have been important and popular top- ics in combustion research. From a fundamental point of view, thermo-diffusive or hydrodynamic ﬂame instabilities might be most interesting[3–5], while phenomena such as blow off or ﬂash back are very relevant for combustion engineering, see e.g. Kröner et al, Aggarwal, Cavaliere et al. The present paper focuses on thermoacoustic instabilities, which result from an interaction between ﬂuctuations of heat release rate and acoustic waves. Starting with the development of rocket engines in the 1930 s, thermoacoustic instabilities have impeded severely the development of reliable combustion equip- ment. The development of lean-premixed, low-emission combus- tion technology for stationary gas turbines has increased the technological relevance of these instabilities, their prediction and control remains a challenging task with great scientiﬁc appeal. Thermoacoustic instabilities are usually conceptualized as a coupled feedback loop involving burner, ﬂame, combustion chamber and plenum (possibly also fuel or air supply, etc): Fluctu- ations of heat release act as a monopole source of sound, the resulting acoustic waves are reﬂected by the combustion chamber or the plenum and in turn modulate the ﬂow conditions at the burner, which successively perturb the ﬂame and thus close the feedback loop. If the resulting relative phase between ﬂuc- tuations of heat release and pressure at the ﬂame are favorable, a self-excited instability may occur. In this well-established framework, thermoacoustic instabilities are considered a result of the combined dynamics of the ﬂame and its acoustic environment, i.e. plenum, burner, combustor, supply lines, etc. a ﬂame placed in a anechoic environment should not be able to develop a thermoa- coustic instability. The present paper develops a different point of view: thermoa- coustic interactions at the ﬂame are analyzed in a framework that properly respects the causal relationships between ‘‘excitation’’ and ‘‘responses’’, respectively. With this perspective, it becomes evident that ﬂame-intrinsic feedback between acoustics-ﬂow- ﬂame-acoustics may give rise tointrinsic ﬂame instabilities, which are distinct from the resonating acoustic eigenmodes of the environment of the ﬂame. Nevertheless, these instabilities are http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2014.006.0008 0010-2180//C 2112014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In an independent study, Hoeijmakers et al explored strat- egies for preventing thermoacoustic instabilities by breaking the aforementioned feedback loop and also observed that a ﬂame can be intrinsically unstable. Experiments were carried out in a setup with signiﬁcant acoustic losses, induced by acoustic horns. The sta- bility behavior was investigated for three different burners, and a range of operating conditions. It was observed that despite the sig- niﬁcant acoustic losses present, thermoacoustic instabilities may still occur. Of course, these results are very closely related to the ideas developed in the present paper. Lending further support to the argument, Bomberg et al have identiﬁed intrinsic ﬂame eigenmodes in experimental setups investigated previously by Noiray et al and Komarek and Polifke, respectively. The paper is organized as follows: The next chapter introduces ﬁrst the low-order modeling concepts that are used to formulate ideas. Then the intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback structure of a velocity-sensitive premixed ﬂame is identiﬁed. The corresponding spectrum of intrinsic eigenmodes is determined for the simple example of ann /C 0 s ﬂame transfer function. In the subsequent sec- tion, a balance for the ﬂow rates of acoustic energy at a premixed ﬂame is formulated, introducing the ‘‘instability potentiality’’. It is found that frequencies where generation of perturba- tion energy by ﬂuctuating heat release is maximal correlate with the intrinsic eigenfrequencies of the ﬂame. Invoking the small gain theorem originally deduced by Zames, it is then shown how these results are related to a general stability criterion for network models. This leads to an optimization criterion for individual ele- ments in acoustic networks, which might be used to optimize bur- ner designs independently from up- or downstream acoustic conditions at an early stage of combustor development. The tools and concepts developed up to that point are then applied to a more realistic ﬂame transfer function, which is representative of turbu- lent premixed swirl ﬂames. The analysis in the present paper is for- mulated in terms of a low-order model for velocity sensitive premixed ﬂames. Nevertheless, implications should go beyond the limitations of the present study and indeed be fairly general, as discussed in the conclusions. 2. Intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback in a velocity-sensitive premixed ﬂame Our investigation is focused on the dynamics of the coupling between the heat release of the ﬂame and the acoustic waves incident to and emitted from the ﬂame. There is a causal chain of events, consisting of the acoustic waves altering the ﬂow ﬁeld, which leads to a ﬂuctuation in heat release, which in turn gener- ates acoustic waves. For premixed ﬂames, the heat release ﬂuctu- ation is typically caused by a velocity perturbationu 0 upstream of the ﬂame. Thus the ﬂame does not respond directly to incident acoustic waves, but to an upstream ﬂow perturbation. The physical mechanism involved may be ﬂame front kinematics, a convective transport of fuel inhomogeneities or a swirl modulation and possi- bly other effects. For example in the case of premixed ﬂames with technical fuel injection, a modulation of air velocityu 0 at the location of fuel injection results in an equivalence ratio modulation/0, which con- vects downstream. For an acoustically ’’stiff’’ injector, positiveu 0 gives a leaner mixture and negativeu 0 a richer mixture, whereas pressure p 0 has no effect. Once the fuel inhomogeneities arrive at the ﬂame, they cause heat release rate ﬂuctuations. On the other hand, inside a swirler, in response to a perturba- tion of velocity, a wave in swirl number (or circulation) is set up, and the ﬂame responds later to the swirl modulation as shown by Straub and Richards as well as Komarek and Polifke. Palies et al have coined the term ’’mode conversion’’ for this effect where an acoustic wave generates a vortical wave. Again, the cause for this generation of swirl modulation isu 0 at the swir- ler, p 0 at the swirler is unimportant. As a last example, according to the Unit Impulse Response model of the G-equation by Blumenthal et al, the ‘‘restoration term’’ of the ﬂame front kinematics is triggered by movement of the ﬂame at the anchoring point. The physical mechanism for this generic ﬂame model may be vortex shedding at a backward facing step. So again,u 0 at the anchoring point is important and the ﬂame transfer functions respect this causality as they relateu 0 to _Q 0. Other than deducing causality from ﬁrst principles, it is sub- stantially harder to retrieve it from experiments. The reason is, that in frequency domain, no discrimination between causes and consequences is possible and therefore, no causality can be inferred from measured results of harmonic solutions. But there is also numerical evidence for the causal relation between a velocity perturbation and heat release ﬂuctuations of laminar premixed ﬂames. Jaensch et al have identiﬁed and validated causal time domain models for the ﬂame transfer function of such a ﬂame from random time series simulation of a CFD model. Low-order modeling concepts are used throughout this paper to formulate ideas. The present chapter introduces very brieﬂy pertinent nomenclature and concepts, more details are found, e.g. Nomenclature CWA characteristic wave amplitude FðsÞ ﬂame transfer function, – f downstream traveling CWA, m s/C 0 1 g upstream traveling CWA, m s/C 0 1 H energy ampliﬁcation matrix, – kmax maximum sound power ampliﬁcation, – n interaction index, – x frequency, rad s/C 0 1 X closed loop denominator of ﬂame feedback, – OLTF open loop transfer function of ﬂame feedback, – p 0 acoustic pressure ﬂuctuation, Pa ~. vector of emitted rescaled CWAs, W s laplace variable ð¼ jx þ rÞ, rad s/C 0 1 r growth rate, rad s/C 0 1 ~1 vector of incident rescaled CWAs, W S scattering matrix, – R energy scaled scattering matrix, – s time delay, s h relative temperature jump (¼ Td=Tu /C 0 1), – u 0 acoustic velocity ﬂuctuation, m s/C 0 1 n ratio of speciﬁc impedances (¼ qu cu=qd cd), – Subscript indices bf burner and ﬂame f ﬂame u upstream d downstream 76 T.

Then the intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback structure of a ducted, velocity-sensitive premixed ﬂame as depicted in Fig. 1 is identiﬁed. The corresponding spectrum of eigenmodes is determined for the simplistic example of ann /C 0 s ﬂame transfer function. In Section 4 the method will be applied to a more complex model of a turbulent premixed swirl burner. 2.01. Low-order thermoacoustic ﬂame model The diameter of the combustor conﬁgurations investigated is assumed to be much smaller than relevant acoustic wave lengths. Therefore, acoustic modes are considered to consist of one dimen- sional plane waves. Under the assumption of an acoustically compact ﬂame with Helmholtz number He /C 17 Lflame=k /C 28 1, the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy may be linearized to relate ﬂuctuations of heat release_Q 0 and acoustic per- turbations of velocityu 0 and pressure p 0 upstream (u) and down- stream (d) of the ﬂame to each other. To simplify the derivation, terms of order Oð2Þ in Mach number and higher are neglected and two non-dimensional parameters are introduced: Ratio of speciﬁc impedancesn /C 17 qucu qdcd, and the relative temperature increase h /C 17 Td=Tu /C 0 1. Fluctuating quantities are denoted with a ’, mean ﬂow quantities do not carry indices: p 0 qc u 0! d ¼ n 0 /C 18/C 19 p 0 qc u 0! u þ 0 huu /C 18/C 19_Q 0 _Q : ð1Þ The ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. describes the coupling of acoustic pres- sure p 0 and velocity u 0 across the discontinuity in speciﬁc imped- ances, the second term accounts for the effect of ﬂuctuating heat release _Q 0. The original derivation of these relations – known also as ‘‘acoustic Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions’’ – was given by Chu, a detailed derivation using the same notation as this paper is found in. The system of Eqs.(1) has constant coefﬁcients and is not closed as _Q 0 is unknown. Closure is achieved – and non-trivial dynamics are introduced – with a model for the heat release ﬂuctuations of the ﬂame: The ﬂame transfer function FðsÞ. As we are assuming a velocity sensitive ﬂame, the heat release ﬂuctuations_Q 0 are related to a velocity perturbationu 0 u upstream of the ﬂame: _Q 0 _Q ¼ FðsÞ u 0 u uu; ð2Þ where s ¼ jx þ r is the Laplace variable. Various strategies to retrieve the ﬂame transfer function FðsÞ are described in the litera- ture. The most popular methods are based on parametrized models such as the kinematic G-equation, and identiﬁcation of non-parametric models from experiments or reactive ﬂow simulations. With the ﬂame transfer function, closure of Eq.(1) is achieved and one can introduce a ﬂame transfer matrix TðsÞ: p 0 qc u 0! d ¼ n 0 01 þ h FðsÞ /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} TðsÞ p 0 qc u 0! u ð3Þ 2.02. Causal representation of ﬂame dynamcis and intrinsic feedback The solution of the 1 D wave equation can be represented as superposition of characteristic waves traveling in opposite directions. On the perspective of the acoustic subsystem contain- ing the ﬂame, acoustic waves that are entering the domain are cau- sal inputs ‘‘excitation’’, while acoustic waves that are leaving the domain are causal outputs ’’responses’’. The direction of propaga- tion ensures causality in the sense that waves that are leaving the domain are caused by waves that entered the domain at former times. Polifke and Gentemann have shown, however, that the analysis of transmission and reﬂection of acoustic waves by a multi-port is facilitated by using a causal representation. The primitive acoustic variablesp 0 and u 0 on the other hand are non- causal quantities in the sense that it is not possible to associate unambiguously a direction of propagation with either of them. The scattering matrix formulation provides a representation of acoustic interactions at an element. Characteristic acoustic wave amplitudes f; g are introduced f /C 171 p 0 qc þ u 0 /C 18/C 19; g /C 171 p 0 qc /C 0 u 0 /C 18/C 19 ð4Þ and the scattering matrix SðsÞ describes how the outgoing waves gu; fd (see Fig. 1) depend on the incident wavesfu; gd: gu fd /C 18/C 19 ¼ ru td tu rd /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} SðsÞ fu gd /C 18/C 19 : ð5Þ Obviously, the coefﬁcients of the scattering matrix S can be identi- ﬁed as transmission and reﬂection factors for the waves incident from the upstream sideu (left side in Fig. 1) or downstream side d (right side) of the multi-port. Note that the notation for the wave vectors and the scattering matrix in Eq.(5) is the one used by Auré- gan and Starobinski: The waves are sorted by port (location), upstream waves come ﬁrst in the signal and response wave vectors, respectively. This notation allows a more natural formulation of the acoustic energy balance, see Section 3, but differs from the one used in other publications. Mathematically, the coefﬁcients of the scattering matrix S (reﬂection and transmission up- and downstream) are obtained by a coordinate transformation of the transfer matrix T: ru ¼ð/C 0 T 11 /C 0 T 12 þ T 21 þ T 22Þ=X; ð6Þ td ¼2=X; ð7Þ tu ¼2ðT 11 T 22 /C 0 T 12 T 21Þ=X; ð8Þ rd ¼ðT 11 /C 0 T 12 þ T 21 /C 0 T 22Þ=X; ð9Þ where Tij are the coefﬁcients of the transfer matrix and X /C 17ðT 11 /C 0 T 12 /C 0 T 21 þ T 22Þð 10Þ is the common denominator of all scattering matrix coefﬁcients. For the special case of a ﬂame transfer matrix – see Eq.(3) – the common denominator is XðsÞ¼ n þ 1 þ h FðsÞ. In general, a low value of X should result in a high gain of the transmission or reﬂec- tion of acoustic signals, as already observed by Gentemann and Polifke and Polifke. Zeros of the denominator XðsÞ! 0 are poles of the ﬂame scattering matrix. It will be shown in the following that the poles of the ﬂame scattering matrix are not arti- facts due to mathematical conversions from transfer to scattering matrix formulation, but indeed are due to intrinsic eigenmodes of the ﬂame and associated resonances. A re-formulation of the system of equations allows to develop a distinct physical interpretation of the intrinsic modes: Instead of directly transforming the closed form ﬂame transfer matrix Eq. (3) to scattering matrix formulation Eq.(5), the open form of the Fig. 1. Velocity sensitive premixed ﬂame anchored in a duct section. T. Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 77.3 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions Eq.(1) is ﬁrst rewritten in scat- tering matrix representation to obtain Sn, i.e. the scattering matrix of the jump in speciﬁc impedances due to the steady heat release. The thermoacoustic effect of the unsteady heat release is subse- quently introduced, using again the ﬂame transfer function Eq. (2). The following intermediate system of equations is obtained: gu fd /C 18/C 19 ¼ 1 n þ1 1/C 0 n 2 2 nn /C 0 1 /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} Sn fu gd /C 18/C 19 þ h n þ1 n /C 18/C 19 FðsÞðfu /C 0 guÞ: ð11Þ The gu wave, which is propagating away from the ﬂame in the upstream direction, is present on both sides of the equations. In the context of a causal representation of the system dynamics, with excitation on the r.h.s. and response on the l.h.s. this means that the wave amplitudegu appears as a cause as well as an effect and thus it causes feed back within the ﬂame model. The structure of this intrinsic feedback cycle is illustrated by the thick red lines in the dynamic system sketch of the ﬂame in Fig. 2. The feedback mechanism involves the upstream traveling wavegu, which contributes to the velocity perturbation at the reference position ‘‘u’’ (see the lower left corner of the ﬁgure). The ﬂame, which is velocity sensitive, responds with a ﬂuctuation in heat release rate _Q 0, which in turn generates an upstream traveling wave gu. It is important to notice that this intrinsic feedback is not visible in transfermatrix representation of the system in Eq.(3). The rea- son for this discrepancy between scattering- and transfermatrix is that the transfermatrix is presuminggu ¼ p 0 u qc /C 0 u 0 u as a input and therefore ignores the causal intrinsic feedback mechanism. 2.03. Stability of intrinsic eigenmodes The open loop dynamics of the feedback cycle introduced in the previous subsection is described by the open loop transfer function (OLTF) and a negative feedback: gu ¼/C 0 h n þ 1 FðsÞ |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} OLTF gu: ð12Þ When solving for the closed loop transfer function dynamics of the scattering matrix of the ﬂame, it is necessary to rewrite Eq.(11) such thatgu appears as output on the l.h.s.: gu fd /C 18/C 19 ¼ 1 n þ1 þh FðsÞ h FðsÞ/C 0 n þ12 2 nðh FðsÞþ 1Þ n /C 0 1 /C 0 h FðsÞ /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} Sf fu gd /C 18/C 19 ¼ ~Sf X fu gd /C 18/C 19 : ð13Þ The matrix inversion involves a division of all coefﬁcients of the scattering matrix with the factor X, which was introduced in Eq. (10). Now this factor can be identiﬁed as the closed loop feedback dynamics corresponding to the open loop feedback cycle of the ﬂame (Eq.12): X ¼ n þ 1 þ h FðsÞ¼ð n þ 1Þ/C 1ð1 þ OLTFðsÞÞ: ð14Þ Thus, the rootss (zeros) of the closed loop denominator XðsÞ¼ 0 are the eigenvalues (poles) of the ﬂame scattering matrix Sf ðsÞ. Roots of X correspond to OLTF¼/C 0 1. The point Pcrit ¼/C 0 1 is called critical point. The eigenmodes of the ﬂame dynamics are stable if all eigen- frequencies correspond to negative growth rates and are unstable if they have positive growth rates. 2.04. Example: intrinsic modes of the n/C 0 s model By way of illustration, the intrinsic eigenfrequencies of a sim- plistic velocity sensitive premixed ﬂame model, i.e. then /C 0 s model with ﬂame transfer function FðsÞ¼ ne/C 0 ss; ð15Þ where n is the ‘‘interaction index’’ ands the time lag, are computed next. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation XðsÞ¼ 0: n þ 1 þ hne/C 0 ss ¼ 0: ð16Þ Inﬁnitely many complex-valued eigenvalues are found for integers z ¼ 0; 1; (see B): sz ¼ j ð2 z þ 1Þp s|ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} xz þ 1 s ln nh 1 þ n /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} r : ð17Þ Normalizing time by choosing:s ¼ 1 gives eigenfrequencies xz=ð2 pÞ¼ 0:5 þ 1 z: ð18Þ The intrinsic eigenmodes of the ﬂame are stable if the growth rates are negativer < 0. As the growth rate is the same for all eigenfre- quencies xz, this condition is globally fulﬁlled ifn < ðn þ 1Þ=h.A n energy argument for low frequencies derived by Polifke and Lawn requires that the interaction index be equal to unity,n ¼ 1. Using the ideal gas law(C) the condition for stability of the intrinsic eigenmodes of then /C 0 s ﬂame model simpliﬁes toh < 3. Figure 3 allows a graphical assessment of the stability of the system. According to Nyquist, unstable eigenfrequencies do not exist if the frequency response of the open loop transfer func- tion OLTFðs /C 17 jxÞ does not encircle the critical point (see Eg. (14)) in clockwise direction. Thus, the Nyquist plot conﬁrms thath ¼ 2 i s stable, h ¼ 3 is marginally stable andh ¼ 4 is unstable. In an independent study, Hoeijmakers et al computed eigenmodes of a simple thermoacoustic model system, with an n /C 0 s heat source placed in a duct. Even in the limit of zero Fig. 2.

Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 Reproduction of Papers reﬂection coefﬁcients, eigenmodes were found. It is evident that these eigenmodes are associated with the instabilities resulting from ﬂame-intrinsic feedback identiﬁed in the present study. Given the stability of the ﬂame alone, conclusions about the sta- bility of the combustion system containing the ﬂame cannot be drawn directly. It is a well known result from control theory that due to feedback, the stability of a linear system is undetermined even if all parts of a system are individually stable. In the present context, this means that even though a ﬂame itself might be stable, given the right feedback of acoustic waves by the upstream an downstream boundaries, the interconnected combustion system might be unstable. Thus there is the need for a weaker (more conservative) stability criterion that allows to draw conclusions concerning thermoacoustic stability without regarding its bound- aries. Such a criterion will be developed in Section 3. 3. Stability criteria based on a balance of acoustic power As stated in the previous section, the stability of a linear acous- tic system depends on all constitutive elements, and can be deter- mined only by the analysis of the entire system. This approach can be tedious for large systems. At an early stage of the design pro- cess, when the acoustic dynamics of all components are not yet known, it may even be impossible. Thus it is of interest to develop a stability criterion based on perturbation energy or sound power, which allows to optimize individual elements of the combustion system independently. Derivations of perturbation energy in increasingly complex ﬂows were developed by Chu, Cantrell et al, Morfey, Myers, Giauque et al, and Brear et al. A deﬁni- tion of perturbation energy implies a decomposition of ﬂow pertur- bations into acoustics, vortices and entropy, but this decomposition is not unambiguously. More recently George and Sujith have pointed out, that in fact, Myers decomposition does not fulﬁll cer- tain properties one should expect from an energy norm, whereas Chu’s norm does, but it lacks the rigorous derivation. The core issue is however that none of the norms leads to a con- servative energy potential, which is needed for the construction of a rigorous stability criterion. Strictly speaking, energy provides a stability criterion only if it is monotonously decreasing for stable systems. This does in general not apply to (acoustic) per- turbation energy. Investigations by Subramanian and Sujith, Blumenthal et al, as well as Wieczorek et al show that due to the acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interaction even low order linear thermoacoustic systems are non-normal. As a consequence (acoustic) perturbation energy may rise even if the thermoacoustic system is asymptotically stable (‘‘transient growth’’). The method we propose instead does not rely on the acoustic energy in the ﬁeld and is therefore not affected by the issues mentioned above. Based on a balance for sound power, Aurégan and Starobinski introduced thewhistling potentiality, which provides a neces- sary-but-not-sufﬁcient criterion for instability in (aero-) acoustic multi-port systems. Polifke linked the argument of Aurégan and Starobinski to commonly used acoustic scattering matrices and applied the criterion under the nameinstability potentiality to a ﬂame system. Asinstability potentialityis sound power based, it is also linked to the Rayleigh criterion (see), though not lim- ited by the strong assumptions of the latter. In this section it will be shown that strong ampliﬁcation ’’gain’’ of sound power and thus strong potentiality of thermoacoustic instability occurs in the vicinity of the intrinsic eigenmodes of the ﬂame. Eventually, a rigorous theoretical science base is provided by linking the energy or sound power based stability criterion to the small gain theorem, which was originally developed by Zames in the domain of control system theory. 3.01. Sound power balance According to the energy corollary of Myers, the ﬂux of acoustic energypa in 1-D ﬂow equals pa ¼ p 0 þ quu 0ðÞ u 0 þ p 0 u qc 2 /C 18/C 19 : ð19Þ Correspondingly, for plane wave propagation along a duct with cross-sectional area A at negligible mean ﬂow Mach number, the sound power P – i.e. the ﬂow rate of acoustic energy with units Watt – evaluates to P ¼ 1 2 A Reðp 0 u 0/C 3 Þ¼ 1 2 q c A ðj f j 2/C 0 j gj 2Þ: ð20Þ In this notation the superscript asterisk in ‘‘ u 0/C 3 ’’ denotes the complex conjugate ofu 0. In order to formulate a balance of acoustic energy at an acoustic two-port with ports ‘‘u’’ and ‘‘d’’, it is convenient to re-scale the characteristic wave amplitudesf and g as follows ~1 /C 17 V fu gd /C 18/C 19; ~. /C 17 V gu fd /C 18/C 19; ð21Þ where V /C 17 vc 0 0 vh /C 20/C 21 with v /C 17 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ qc A r : ð22Þ Note that the acoustic state vectors~1 and ~. represent the incident ‘‘excitation’’ and outgoing ‘‘responses’’, respectively. Both vectors contain the upstream and downstream contributions needed for the net acoustic power balance deduced below (see Fig. 1). Of course, with these variables the scattering matrix S has to be re-scaled, too. Deﬁning R /C 17 VSV/C 0 1; ð23Þ one formulates concisely for the scattering of acoustic waves by a two-port: ~. ¼ R~1: ð24Þ The re-scaled acoustic variables are energy-extensive, i.e. the 2- norm of an acoustic state vector~1 or ~. represents the corresponding ﬂow rate of acoustic energy P incident upon or emanating from a two-port, respectively: Pin ¼k ~1 k 2 ¼ ~1 y~1; ð25Þ Pout ¼k ~.k 2 ¼ ~. y~.: ð26Þ where ð/C 1Þy denotes the complex conjugate transpose (the ‘‘adjoint’’) of a vector or matrix. The steady-state balance of acoustic power for a two-port now reads as follows, Pgen ¼ Pout /C 0 Pin: ð27Þ The rate of generation of acoustic energy Pgen is the difference between incident and outgoing acoustic ﬂow rates. If Pgen > 0 inci- dent acoustic power is ampliﬁed, i.e. there is overall generation of acoustic energy by the acoustic two-port, if Pgen < 0 more power is dissipated than produced. Combining Eqs. 24, 26, 25 and 27, one ﬁnds that Pgen ¼ ~1 yðRy R|{z} H Þ~1 /C 0 ~1 y~1: ð28Þ This formulation makes explicit that the generation of acoustic energy by a two-port is related to the non-unitary character of its scattering matrix R: Production Pgen ¼ 0 if the scattering matrix is unitary, i.e. if its adjoint is equal to its inverse,Ry ¼ R/C 0 1. Acoustic states that correspond to maximal (or minimal) gener- ation of acoustic energy can be identiﬁed by determining the T. Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 79.3 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames eigenvectors ~ei and eigenvalueski; i ¼ 1; 2 of the energy ampliﬁca- tion matrix H /C 17 Ry R. Following Aurégan and Starobinski, the sum of the energy of the incoming waves is conveniently normal- ized to unity,k~1 k 2 ¼ 1. Then the energy of the outgoing waves is equal to the value of the quadratic form~1 y H~1 on the unit sphere, which can be reduced to a sum of squares: ~1 y H~1 ¼ X 2 i¼1 ki j gij 2: ð29Þ The energy ampliﬁcation matrix H is positive deﬁnite and symmet- ric. Thus its eigenvectors~ei are orthogonal, the left and right eigen- vectors are identical and all eigenvalueski are real and positive. Note that the eigenvalueski of the energy ampliﬁcation matrix H are equivalent to the squares of the singular values of the energy scattering matrix R. The acoustic energy balance at a two-port may be visualized as follows: Let U ¼ ~e 1 ~e 2 /C 18/C 19 ð30Þ denote the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the scattering matrix, Uy HU ¼ diagðkmax; kminÞ, and let ~g /C 17 Uy~1. The unit sphere in vari- ables ~1 – i.e. all acoustic states with incoming acoustic power Pin normalized to unity – is mapped by U to a unit sphere in variables ~g. The scattering of acoustic waves corresponds to stretching (gen- eration) or shrinking (dissipation) of the acoustic state vector, the eigenvectors ~e identify the states that result in maximal or minimal ampliﬁcation of acoustic energy, see Fig. 4. All other possible acous- tic states are linear combinations of the two orthonormal eigenvec- tors ~e 1 and ~e 2. An eigenvaluek ¼ 1 would correspond to zero net generation of acoustic energy Pgen ¼ 0, eigenvalues larger (smaller) than unity represent generation (dissipation) of acoustic energy. The ﬁrst eigenvalue kmax of the matrix H, gives the largest possible value of outgoing acoustic energy (maximum ampliﬁcation) for all nor- malized acoustic signal states~1 with k~1 k 2 ¼ 1. The second eigen- value kmin corresponds to minimum outgoing energy (maximum dissipation). Obviously, a (thermo-) acoustic system may go unsta- ble only if at least one of its two-ports has an eigenvaluekmax > 1. This condition is necessary, but not sufﬁcient for instability to occur – dissipation of acoustic energy by other two-ports may exceed the generation – thus one may speak of ‘‘instability potentiality’’. Keep in mind that the energy scaled scattering matrix R depends on frequency, thus all quantities deduced from it, in particular the eigenvaluekmax are also functions of frequency. 3.02. Sound power balance of the n/C 0 s model As the common denominator X may be factored out of the scat- tering matrix of the ﬂame in Eq.(13), poles of the scattering matrix Sf are also poles of the energy scaled scattering matrix Rf. Sf ¼ 1 X ~Sf! Rf ¼ 1 X ~Rf ð31Þ When computing the quadratic form Hf, the matrix retains the common denominator X 2 Hf ¼ 1 X 2 ~Hf; ~Hf ¼ ~Ry f ~Rf ð32Þ and thus eigenfrequencies and poles of the scattering matrix are also maxima in ampliﬁcation of perturbation energy. Figure 5 shows the maximum acoustic power ampliﬁcation eigenvalue kmax of then /C 0 s model for a value of the relative tem- perature increment h ¼ 2, which corresponds to an intrinsically stable ﬂame. Repeated peaks in acoustic power ampliﬁcation are observed at the respective eigenfrequenciesxz=ð2 pÞ¼ 0:5 þ 1 z of the n /C 0 s ﬂame model, see Eq. (18). In the light of the above discussion of the intrinsic feedback structure of a velocity sensitive premixed ﬂame, the interpretation of this result is quite straight- forward: Near-resonance response of the ﬂame to external excita- tion results in large ampliﬁcation of acoustic energy. 3.03. Small gain theorem Consider a combustion system partitioned into the combustion chamber section containing the ﬂameðf Þ and upstream and down- stream boundary conditionsðbcÞ as sketched in Fig. 6. The reﬂec- tions of acoustic waves up- and downstream (Ru; Rd) of the ﬂame can be expressed as a diagonal scattering matrix Sbc: fu gd /C 18/C 19 ¼ Ru 0 0 Rd /C 18/C 19 |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} Sbc gu fd /C 18/C 19; ð33Þ The scattering matrix of the ﬂame Sf is described in Eq.(13).

Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 Reproduction of Papers which is, however, only possible if the boundary conditions as expressed through Sbc are known. The small gain theorem allows to state a stability criterion for the interconnected system using only minimal assumptions on Sbc. It states that a system is stable if all subsystems (Sbc; Sf ) are sta- ble and the maximum gaincð/C 1Þof the entire open loop system is less than unity for all frequencies: cðSbc Sf Þ 6 cðSbcÞcðSf Þ < 1: ð36Þ The normc which deﬁnes the gain only needs to satisfy some very general restrictions. Because of its ease of physical interpretation, it is convenient to use the maximum acoustic power ampliﬁcation of the subsystems – i.e. the instability potentiality as introduced above – as a norm for the gain. cð/C 1Þ ¼kmax ¼ maxðeigðHÞÞ ¼ k Rk 1 /C 0/C 12 : ð37Þ The maximum eigenvalue of the acoustic power ampliﬁcation matrix H is equivalent to the square of the maximum singular value of the energy scattering matrix R. In control theory, the maximum singular value is known as the H 1 norm, whereas it is known as spectral norm in mathematics. The acoustic power of a unit input vector of acoustic invariants to the ﬂame system is at maximum ampliﬁed by the maximum eigenvaluekf;max of the Hf potentiality matrix. The same accounts for the boundary system and the stability criterion becomes: kf;max kbc;max < 1 ð38Þ In the limiting case of the minimal assumption of energy preserv- ing, passive boundaries ðkbc;max ¼ 1Þ, the maximum eigenvalue of the ﬂame potentiality matrix would need to be less than unity for all frequencieskf;max < 1 in order to ensure stability. As the example of a premixed turbulent combustor in Section 4 will show, this restriction is met very rarely because the small gain theorem is very conservative. Nevertheless it may give the opportunity to deduce burner design objectives even at a very early stage of development, when the acoustic properties of the subsystemsðf; bcÞ are not known entirely, yet. By minimization of the instability potentialitykf;max, the burner designs may be optimized for minimum ampliﬁcation of acoustic energy. For a smaller acoustic energy ampliﬁcation, less damping by the boundarieskbc;max is needed in order to ensure sta- bility. Thus, minimizingkf;max should enhance stability. The more information on the acoustics of the combustion sys- tem becomes available, the less conservative the stability criterion becomes. If burner and ﬂame scattering matrix are known,Sf can be replaced by Sbf instead of contributing the effect of the burner to the unknown boundaries. If eventually all elements of the system are known, the open loop scattering matrix of Eq.(34) is fully speciﬁed. Instead of directly solving for the eigenvalues of the closed system, one of the variables (fu; gd) may be eliminated. The resulting open loop transfer function may then be analyzed by a complex plane plot and the stability criterion developed by and named after Nyquist. Here the connection between the small gain theorem and the Nyquist stability criterion becomes apparent: If the gain of the open loop transfer function (OLTF) is strictly less than 1, the critical point cannot be encircled by the path of the OLTF in the Nyquist plot. The restriction to stable subsystems (Sbc; Sf ), again similar to the Nyquist criterion, is usually not limiting. The acoustic modes with- out ﬂame interaction are stable and the inherent eigenmodes of the ﬂame without acoustic boundary conditions are, in all physical meaningful cases we investigated, stable as well. The instability of thermoacoustic systems observed is established by the coupling between ﬂame and acoustics. 4. Case study: turbulent premixed swirl ﬂame In this section, the ampliﬁcation of acoustic power due to intrinsic resonance of a velocity sensitive premixed ﬂame and related stability criteria, i.e. the instability potentiality and the small gain theorem, are scrutinized for a turbulent premixed swirl ﬂame. The conﬁguration under consideration is the ‘‘TD 1 burner’’, which has been investigated extensively at the Lehrstuhl für Ther- modynamik, both experimentally and numerically. The burner, which is rated at approximately 60 k W, has a tangential swirl generated, followed by an annular ﬂow passage with a cen- terbody. The ﬂame is stabilized downstream of a sudden expansion in cross-sectional area, thanks to a recirculation zone that forms downstream of the centerbody in the swirling ﬂow. Fig. 6.

Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 81.3 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames The area expansion is acoustically modeled by a simpliﬁed scat- tering matrix, see e.g. Polifke, which takes into account only the effect of the change in cross-sectional areaa ¼ Au=Ad on the acoustic velocities. The burner layout also implies that the refer- ence velocityu 0 u for the ﬂame transfer function Eq.(2) and subse- quently the ﬂame model Eq.(11) is not located directly upstream of the ﬂame, but inside the burner nozzle just upstream of the area jump. A sketch of the thermoacoustic network model used in this investigation is depicted in Fig. 7, the parameters of the geometry are listed in Table 1. The ﬂame transfer function FðsÞ is modeled by the following expression: F ¼ð 1 þ aÞeð/C 0 s s 1/C 0 s 2 r 2 2 Þ /C 0 aeð/C 0 s s 2/C 0 s 2 r 2 2 Þ ð39Þ Previous studies conducted by Lawn and Polifke, Schuermans et al and Hirsch et al have shown that this functional form of the ﬂame transfer function in combination with the Ran- kine–Hugoniot jump equations reproduces quite well the ﬂame dynamics of typical turbulent premixed swirl burners. Furthermore, this form ensures the correct valuej Fj! 1 in the limit of low fre- quencies Polifke and Lawn. The parameters for the TD 1 ﬂame considered in the present paper are also listed in Table 1. The gain j Fj of the ﬂame transfer function is shown in Fig. 8(top). It exhibits a characteristic local maximum in gain (‘‘excess gain’’) at a frequency of around 50 Hz and then decays at higher frequencies. Figure 9 depicts the absolute values of the coefﬁcients of the scattering matrix Sbf of the acoustic system composed of burner and ﬂame. The reference positions of the scattering matrix upstream (u) and downstream (d) are marked in the system sketch (Fig. 7). Remarkably, all four coefﬁcients show typical resonance peaks at a frequency offres ¼ 150 HZ Similar peaks were already observed by Gentemann and Polifke, who pointed out that the maxima inj Sijj coincide with minima of the common denomi- nator X of the scattering matrix, see Eq.(10). Indeed, such a mini- mum is also observed in the present case, see Fig. 8, middle plot. However, while a proper physical explanation of these observa- tions was not developed by Gentemann and Polifke, the large reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients at 150 HZ can now be interpreted physically as a near-resonant response of the ﬂame to the incident acoustic excitation, where ’’resonant’’ refers, of course, to the intrinsic eigenmodes of the ﬂame. This interpretation is strengthened further by re-writing the factor X such that its rela- tion to the open loop transfer function of burner and ﬂame is made explicit: X ¼ð n þ 1Þ 1 þ ha n þ 1 FðsÞ |ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ{zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ} OLTF BB@ CCA ð40Þ Clearly, resonance X! 0 will occur as the OLTF approaches the critical point ‘‘/C 0 1’’. For the present conﬁguration of burner and ﬂame, with a ﬂame transfer function according to Eq. (39) and model parameters as listed in Table 1, the Nyquist plot Fig. (10) shows indeed that at frequencies near 150 Hz the OLTF curve approaches the critical point.

Correspondingly the maximum eigenvaluekbf;max of the acoustic power ampliﬁcation matrix Hbf peaks at 150 HZ (Fig. 8). Energy generation kbf;max is larger than unity throughout the frequency range observed and peaks at a value maxðkbf;maxÞ/C 25 315 (!). Thus, the ﬂame is able to produce acoustic energy throughout all frequencies, and in particular so at 150 Hz. Considering Figs. 8–10 in the light of the arguments put forward in Section 3.02, one concludes that the peaks in scattering matrix coefﬁcients jruj; jtdj; jtuj; jrdj and in acoustic power ampliﬁcation kmax are not due to excess gain of the ﬂame transfer function FðsÞ, but due to the intrinsic feedback loop and the associated resonance, manifested as the minimum in X at 150 Hz. Now we turn to the small gain theorem and its consequences for the present conﬁguration. The boundary scattering Matrix Sbc is Sbc ¼ ru e/C 0 s 2 lu=cu 0 0 rd e/C 0 s 2 ld=cd! ð41Þ When evaluating the quadratic form Hbc, the complex exponentials drop out and the maximum acoustic power ampliﬁcation of the boundary is: cðSbcÞ¼ kbc;max ¼ maxðr 2 u; r 2 dÞð 42Þ By evaluating the small gain stability criterion, a conservative limit for the reﬂection factors at the boundaries can be determined: ru;d < ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ maxðkbf;maxÞ s /C 25 0:0563: ð43Þ For the given value of stable reﬂection factorsru ¼ rd ¼ 0:0563, a stability map of the combustion system is shown in Fig. 11. The maximum growth rate (smallest damping rate) is plotted as a func- tion of the nondimensionalized lengths of the duct sections up- and downstream of the ﬂame. The lengths were varied between 0 and about two times the wave lengths inside the respective ducts at the critical frequency offres ¼ 150 HZ~l ¼ lf res=c. In agreement with the small gain stability criterion, we observe that the system is sta- ble for all parameters investigated with a maximum growth rate observed of /C 0 13:3. There are three resonant duct lengths up and downstream and maximum growth rates are observed when both duct sections are tuned to be resonating. Apparently, a resonance of one duct section can be damped by the other section if the corresponding length is set to a non-resonating length. 5. Conclusion The thermoacoustic stability of velocity sensitive premixed ﬂames was scrutinized. A causal representation of the acoustic- ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions revealed an intrinsic feedback mechanism: if an upstream velocity disturbance induces a modu- lation of the heat release rate, an acoustic wave will be generated that travels in the upstream direction, where it inﬂuences in turn the acoustic velocity, such that a closed feedback loop results. Even if theintrinsic eigenmodesof the ﬂame, which result from this feedback loop are stable, the ﬂame system has peaks in its acoustic energy ampliﬁcation when excited at resonant frequen- cies. This was shown rigorously by evaluating the ‘‘instability potentiality’’ from a balance of acoustic energy across the ﬂame. One obtains factors of maximum (as well as minimum) power ampliﬁcation over all possible acoustic states. The relation of maximum power ampliﬁcation to peaks in the scattering matrix coefﬁcients and the open loop transfer function of the internal ﬂame dynamics was also elaborated. Based on the acoustic power ampliﬁcation, the small gain theo- rem was introduced and a corresponding energy-based stability criterion was formulated. Given passive boundaries, the gain – which is equivalent to the maximum sound power ampliﬁcation – must be less than unity for all frequencies to ensure stability. The small gain theorem requires only minimal a priori assump- tions on upstream and downstream acoustic boundary conditions. The concepts were exempliﬁed ﬁrst with a simplistic n /C 0 s model and then with a ﬂame transfer function that is representa- tive of turbulent swirl burners. It should be appreciated, however, that application of the ideas and methods developed here are not restricted to these conﬁgurations. Acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions that involve ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio or a pres- sure sensitive ﬂame transfer function should in general also exhibit intrinsic feedback, with similar consequences for ampliﬁcation of acoustic power and combustor dynamics as presented here. The causal mechanisms involved in a pressure sensitive response of the ﬂame may be resonances of an acoustically ‘‘soft’’ injection sys- tem as described by Huber and Polifke, or autoignition. The impact of those processes on the ﬂame intrinsic eigenmodes needs to be scrutinized and validated in future research, which involves numerical and experimental investigations yet to be done. It is apparent that frequencies, where the acoustic power ampli- ﬁcation of the ﬂame is very high, may be critical frequencies for the stability of a combustion system. More research and a validation with experiments regarding critical burner frequencies are needed. First results have been presented by Bomberg et al. Fig. 10.

Emmert et al / Combustion and Flame 162 75–85 83.3 Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Instability of Premixed Flames The small gain stability criterion is very conservative and there- fore not immediately useful for stability prediction in an applied context. Nevertheless, it may be used as an optimization objective and comparison benchmark for combustor stability. Further stud- ies to evaluate the effectiveness of this method are needed. Furthermore, the small gain theorem is valid also for a large class of nonlinear systems. Thus an extension and application to nonlinear ﬂame models seems possible and will be the subject of future research.

Bomberg, S. Jaensch, W. Polifke∗ Professur f¨ ur Thermoﬂuiddynamik Technische Universit¨ at M¨ unchen D-85747, Garching, Germany Abstract Premixed ﬂames are velocity sensitive, i.e. they react to a velocity perturbation at the burner mouth, say, with ﬂuctuations in heat release rate. Unsteady heat release generates acoustic waves that travel back from the ﬂame to the burner mouth, where they modulate the veloc- ity and thereby close an intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop. The present paper demonstrates that cor- responding ITA eigenmodes are in general important for the dynamics and stability of premixed combustion sys- tems. It is shown that the complete set of eigenmodes of a combustor test rig should be interpreted as the sum of acoustic and ITA eigenmodes. A procedure is pre- sented which allows to distinguish between eigenmodes that may be considered as acoustic modes driven by the ﬂame, versus those resulting from ITA feedback (but inﬂuenced by the acoustic properties of the combus- tor). This procedure is based on a factorization of the dispersion relation of the thermoacoustic model. Dif- ferences between the acoustic and intrinsic eigenmodes of a combustor test rig, in particular the corresponding mode shapes, are discussed. The paradoxical observa- tion that increased acoustic losses at the boundaries may destabilize a combustion system is explained as an in- stability of the dominant ITA mode.

Introduction Thermoacoustic stability of combustion systems as diverse as gas turbines and domestic burners is impor- tant for emissions, noise and wear. Such devices possess ∗Corresponding author Email address: polifke@tfd.mw.tum.de (W. Polifke) URL: http://www.tfd.mw.tum.de (W. Polifke) acoustic modes (also known as ”cavity modes”), which may be attenuated or ampliﬁed by the unsteady heat re- lease. According to Rayleigh, the ampliﬁcation is driven by heat release ﬂuctuations in phase with pres- sure oscillations. The common perception is that insta- bility occurs due to acoustic eigenmodes becoming un- stable if the driving by the ﬂame exceeds the damping by acoustic losses inside the device and at the bound- aries. Recently it was discovered that premixed ﬂames can exhibit thermoacoustic instability even if non-reﬂective boundary conditions enforce that resonant acoustic modes cannot exist. Bomberg et al iden- tiﬁed the mechanism causing such instabilities as an intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback, illustrated by Figure 3 b. This mechanism may be summarized as fol- lows: Premixed ﬂames are velocity sensitive, i.e. they react with ﬂuctuations in heat release to a perturbation of velocity at an upstream location, say at the burner mouth. Heat release ﬂuctuations act as a volume source and generate upstream traveling acoustic waves, which in turn cause upstream velocity perturbations. Even if the ITA modes caused by the feedback are stable, they are associated with the ampliﬁcation of acoustic power scattered by burner and ﬂame of a system. There- fore, ITA modes may be distinguished from the acous- tic modes of the system. Note that they should not be confused with thermo-diﬀusive intrinsic instabilities of premixed ﬂames. In this paper we demonstrate that ITA modes are not only encountered in systems of dump combustor ge- ometries with non reﬂecting boundaries as shown by. They actually may be observed in combus- tor conﬁgurations of applied interest. At ﬁrst the linear acoustic network model of the investigated combustor test rig as depicted in Fig. 1 is introduced. The pure acoustic modes are obtained by removing the ﬂame dy- namics from the full combustor model (Fig. 3 a).

Even- tually a procedure is presented that shows how the eigenmodes of the full combustor system relate to the pure acoustic and the pure ITA modes (Fig. 3 c). The total number of eigenmodes is exactly equal to the sum of acoustic and ITA modes. The frequency of the dom- inant ITA mode in the test rig we investigate is within the range, but di ﬀerent from the ﬁrst two acoustic lon- gitudinal eigenfrequencies. Its mode shape is similar to a combination of both of them. Eventually the paradox that damping of acoustic modes by introducing losses at the boundaries can destabilize a thermoacoustic sys- tem – as previously observed in numerical simulation by Silva et al – is explained as a result of ITA feedback. 2. The Premixed Combustion Test Rig Network Model Linear, low-order acoustic network models have proven their capability to predict thermoacoustic insta- bilities in experiment and simulation. By construction, such models take into consideration the relevant interactions between velocity, heat release rate and acoustics and thus capture also the e ﬀects of ITA feedback. This justiﬁes the use of a low-order net- work model to demonstrate the existence and impact of ITA modes on the dynamics of a combustion system with reﬂective boundaries. The conﬁguration investigated in the present study is depicted in Figure 1, with model parameters speciﬁed in Table 1. It represents a perfectly premixed, single burner test rig that was experimentally investigated by Komarek and Polifke. Tay-Wo-Chong et al analyzed a similar model of the test rig with a length of the combustion chamber l C = 0.07 m. Whereas the model of was a classical frequency domain low or- der network model, here linear state space models are used, as described by Emmert et al. Propagation of acoustic waves is modeled by 1 D linearized Euler equations, which are spatially discretized using a third order upwind scheme. The frequency range of interest extends to 500 Hz, which is below the cut on frequency of the plenum fco = 1.084 c/(2πr) ≈ 1000 Hz, with Table 1: Parameters of the test rig network model.

All area changes are modeled as acous- tically compact elements without losses or correction factors. The axial swirler is assumed to be acoustically transparent. As illustrated in Figure 1, the network model can be divided into four parts: the upstream and downstream sections (u,d), the acoustic part of the burner mouth and ﬂame (b), and the unsteady heat release of the ﬂame (f). 2.01. Upstream and Downstream Sections As Figure 1 shows, the upstream and downstream sections are composite models. The upstream part con- sists of a closed end, two duct sections of plenum and swirler annulus and an area contraction in between. Downstream there is a duct section that represents the combustion chamber and an open end. Note that imposed on the downstream side the reﬂection coe ﬃ- cient of a perforated plate, which was estimated to be in the range Rx ∈[−1,0]. The dynamics of these two sections are lumped into impedances Zu(s), Zd(s): p ¯ρ¯c u = Zu(s)uu; p ¯ρ¯c d = Zd(s)ud, (1) where ¯ρ,¯c are the mean density and speed of sound and p,u the acoustic pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations. The Laplace variable s = jω+ σ is deﬁned by the angular frequency ωand the growth rate σ. 2.02. Burner Mouth and Flame The burner mouth (see Fig. 3) comprises the area ex- pansion into the combustion chamber and the acoustic ﬂame model. As the distance between the burner mouth and ﬂame lf ≈0.0074 m is much smaller than the wave- length at the maximum frequency of interest 500 Hz: λ= c/f ≈0.07 m, it is modeled acoustically compact.4 Acoustic and Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes of a Premixed Combustor The velocity ﬂuctuations at the burner mouth are re- trieved as input signal for the heat release model. For simplicity zero Mach number is assumed and the trans- fer matrix of the area expansion ∆ Area 2 is: [ p ¯ρ¯c i ui ] = [1 0 0 α ] = [ p ¯ρ¯c u uu ] (2) with α2 = Au/Ad the area ratio between the cross section of the mixing tube and the combustion chamber. An intermediate node p/(¯ρ¯c)i, ui is located between area change and ﬂame. The acoustic ﬂame model ∆ Temp is based on lin- earized Rankine Hugoniot jump equations across a com- pact heat source, with heat release ﬂuctuations: [ p ¯ρ¯c d ud ] = [ξ 0 0 0 1 θ ] p ¯ρ¯c i ui ˙q′  (3) where ξ = ρucu/ρdcd is the ratio of speciﬁc impedances and θ = (Td −Tu)/Tu is the normalized temperature ratio.

Unsteady Heat Release The model is closed by a ﬂame transfer function (FTF). It relates velocity ﬂuctuations uuat the burner mouth with the normalized global heat release ﬂuctu- ations of the ﬂame ˙q′= ˙Q′¯uu/ ¯˙Q: ˙q′= F(s)uu (5) This FTF is a ﬁnite impulse response model that was re- trieved from LES simulation of a 30 k W perfectly pre- mixed turbulent swirl ﬂame and system identiﬁcation (SI) techniques. It was validated against experimen- tal results [11, Fig. 6,7] and its frequency response is shown in Fig. 2. 3. Pure Acoustic, Pure ITA and Full System Modes Subsequently, the dynamics and stability of the test rig network model are investigated. For this purpose, the eigenmodes of the full linear system are derived. In addition, two simpliﬁed systems are investigated. At ﬁrst, the unsteady heat release is removed from the sys- tem in order to obtain pure acoustic modes. Then the acoustic reﬂections at the up- and downstream sections 100 200 300 400 500 -2π -4π -6π Frequency (Hz) ∠ F [rad] 0.05 1.05 |F| Fig. 2: Frequency response of the FTF. are suppressed and pure ITA modes remain. Finally the corresponding eigenvalues are computed and compared against each other and validated using previously pub- lished results. 3.01. Full system modes In order to solve for the dynamics of the full test rig network model, the equations (1),(4) and (5) are re- ordered: 0 =  −1 Zu 0 0 0 0 0 −1 Zd 0 ξ 0 −1 0 0 0 α 0 −1 θ 0 F 0 0 −1  /bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext/bracehext A(s)  p ¯ρ¯c u uu p ¯ρ¯c d ud ˙q′  (6) Now the eigenvalues can be computed as the roots s of the characteristic equation det(A(s)) = Zd(s)α−Zu(s)ξ+ Zd(s)F(s)θ= 0. (7) A similar formulation is given in [15, Eq. 7], where in- stead of an impedance, an upstream admittance is con- sidered. The eigenvalues of the full system are related to the acoustics as well as to the ﬂame dynamics. 3.02. Pure Acoustic Modes The burner mouth and ﬂame section is inﬂuenced by acoustic reﬂections up- and downstream as well as the heat release model. Eliminating the ﬂame dynamics by setting the FTF to zero, F = 0 in Eq. (7), results in a pure acoustic system as shown in Fig. 3 a with eigenval- ues: 0 = Zd(s)α−Zu(s)ξ. (8) For high frequencies, the ﬂame response typically dies out F(s) ≈ 0 and the characteristic equation of the full system (7) becomes the same as the one of the pure acoustic system (8). Therefore, at high frequencies acoustic modes are not aﬀected by the ﬂame.

Pure Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes Eliminating acoustic reﬂections from the up- and downstream section instead imposes Zu = −1, Zd = +1 in Eq. (7). In this case, the system reduces to the ITA feedback system depicted in Fig. 3 b with dispersion re- lation: 0 = α+ ξ+ F(s)θ. (9) This equation, which was previously reported by, [16, Eq. (14)] and [7, Eq. (14)], is clearly distinct from the acoustic modes of the system (8). 3.04. Validation and Comparison of Full, Acoustic and Intrinsic System The eigenvalues of the full, the pure acoustic and the pure ITA system are displayed in Fig. 4. We observe that the number of the pure acoustic plus the number of the pure ITA eigenvalues is equal to the total number of full system eigenmodes. This suggests that the full set of system eigenmodes comprises acoustic and ITA modes. There are three dominant – i.e. least decaying – modes of the full system ( ) at approximately 42 Hz, 111 Hz and 315 Hz, delimited by the dashed line in Fig. 4. The growth rates of all eigenfrequencies are negative, thus the full system is stable. This is in agree- ment with, where it is mentioned that in the burner test rig an instability close to 100 Hz was observed. In the present model this mode is dominant and marginally stable. According to a preliminary estimation, only two acoustic modes are expected in the frequency range un- der investigation. This is in agreement with the pure −100 −80 −60 −40 −20 0 200 Growth Rate (Hz) Frequency (Hz) Fig. 4: Eigenfrequencies of full ( ), acoustic ( ) and ITA ( ) system of the test rig model are corresponding but distinct. acoustic modes ( ) computed from Eq. (8) and shown in Fig. 4. Tay-Wo-Chong et al attributed one of the three dominant modes to ”ﬂame dynamics”, which in the light of recent developments should be interpreted as an ITA mode ( ) (Eq. (9)) at ≈111 Hz in the vicinity. 4. The Link Between Pure Acoustic, Pure ITA and Full System Modes Now we want to know which eigenmodes should be regarded as acoustic modes driven by the unsteady heat release of the ﬂame, and which should be considered intrinsic thermoacoustic modes perturbed by acoustic reﬂections. This cannot be simply identiﬁed from the spectrum shown in Fig. 4, as the distance between the eigenvalues is not a unique criterion. In order to es- tablish this relation, the full system model is reformu- lated and factorized into pure acoustic and pure ITA sub-systems, respectively. At ﬁrst we switch from primitive variables p,u to characteristic waves (CW A)f,g: f = (p/(¯ρ¯c) + u) /2; g = (p/(¯ρ¯c) −u) /2 (10) For the up- and downstream sections this implies the transformation from impedances to reﬂection factors: fu = Rugu; Ru = (Zu + 1)/(Zu −1), (11) gd = Rd fd; Rd = (Zd −1)/(Zd + 1). (12) The burner and ﬂame transfer matrix is transformed to scattering matrix as well: [gu fd ] =  α−ξ α+ξ α+ξ θ α+ξ 2αξ α+ξ ξ−α α+ξ ξθ α+ξ   fu gd ˙q′ . (13) In order to close the FTF model the relation between the reference velocity ﬂuctuation and the CW Auu = fu −gu.4 Acoustic and Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes of a Premixed Combustor is used. Eqs.

(14) Each line of the system reﬂects the open loop trans- fer functions relating inputs and outputs of the network model and its closure on the right hand side by -1. The characteristic equation is det(A(s)) = 0 = −4(Zd(s)α−Zu(s)ξ+ Zd(s)F(s)θ) (α+ ξ)(Zd(s) + 1)(Zu(s) −1). (15) The denominator is always non-zero. Zu = 1 and Zd = −1 would imply the respective reﬂection factors being inﬁnite, while the parameters αand ξare positive and bounded. Thus the eigenvalues need to fulﬁll the condition 0 = Zd(s)α−Zu(s)ξ+ Zd(s)F(s)θ, (16) which is the same as the characteristic equation of the system deﬁned in primitive variables (compare Eq. (7)). In contrast to the transfer matrix formulation in prim- itive acoustic variables p′, u′ we can now separate out the gu waves caused by the ﬂame. In Eq. (14) the heat release ˙q′ is driving gu by θ/(α+ ξ) (column 6, row 2) and gu in turn is acting on fu by (Zu + 1)/(Zu −1) and uu by −1 (column 2 and rows 1, 5). We rearrange the equations such that in Eq.

But now the system of equations ˜A(s) has a block matrix structure, which should be inter- preted as follows: The upper left 4 by 4 matrix captures the pure acoustic dynamics, whereas the lower right 2 by 2 matrix, as we will show, models the intrinsic sys- tem. On the o ﬀ diagonal there are coupling terms for the acoustic system acting on the intrinsic system (lower left) and the intrinsic system driving the acoustic system (upper right). This way to partition and interconnect the pure acoustic and pure ITA system is depicted in Fig. 3 c. The acoustic system is feeding velocity perturbations at the burner mouth into the ITA system, where they con- tribute to the perturbations of the intrinsic system itself and resonate in ITA feedback. In turn, acoustic waves gu, fd generated by the ITA system are fed back into the acoustic system.

(18) Sweeping the value of this parameter from µ = 0 to µ = 1 allows a continuous transition between the orig- inal full system ( µ = 1) and the pure acoustic and ITA systems. Choosing the parameter µ = 0 results in the characteristic equation: det( ˜A(s)) = (Zdα−Zuξ)(α+ ξ+ Fθ) = 0, (19) which is factorized into the sum of pure acoustic and ITA eigenvalues (see Eq. (8),(9); Fig. 3). This way to transform and rearrange the system seems tedious, however it would not be suﬃcient to sim- ply modulate the FTF F →µF. If one were to do so, µ = 1 would give the full system, while µ = 0 would result in pure acoustic, but not in pure ITA modes. 5. Numerical Results Now the test rig system is examined using the deriva- tions from the previous sections. For this purpose, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the systems under in- vestigation are computed. At ﬁrst the modulation pa- rameter µis used to discriminate between acoustic and ITA eigenmodes of the full system. Subsequently, the eigenvectors of the most dominant eigenmodes are an- alyzed. Eventually the inﬂuence of the downstream re- ﬂection coe ﬃcient on the eigenvalues of the system is investigated.

Correspondence of Eigenvalues In the previous sections, we have shown that forµ= 0 the eigenmodes of the pure acoustic and ITA systems emerge. For µ = 1, the full system dynamics are re- covered from the modulated system. Now a sweep of µ from 0 to 1 is performed and the resulting eigenvalues of the coupled system are shown in Figure 5. By doing so, a 1:1 relation between the eigenmodes of the full sys- tem and the pure acoustic and ITA modes is established. We observe, that the three dominant eigenmodes of the system stem in fact from two acoustic and one intrin- sic mode, respectively. Both acoustic eigenmodes are stabilized by the coupling with the ﬂame dynamics, i.e. the growth rates become more negative as µ increases. Conversely the ITA mode becomes more unstable. 5.02. Comparison of Mode Shapes The eigenvectors of the ﬁrst (1 /4 wave) and second (3/4 wave) acoustic and the dominant ITA eigenmode are shown in Figure 6. The mode shapes of the pure acoustic system are drawn as dashed lines, wheres the full system modes are full lines. The ﬁrst acoustic mode (, ) has almost con- stant phase for both pressure and velocity and there- fore is a quarter wave resonance of the system. Due to the coupling with the ﬂame, it is shifted towards higher pressures and velocities in the combustion chamber and lower velocities in the swirler section. This is what is to be expected as the ﬂame is mainly acting as a volume source. We observe that the second acoustic mode (, ) has one phase jump of πin velocity at the temperature jump and a phase jump in pressure at the area contrac- tion at the end of the plenum. Thus it can be identiﬁed as a three quarter wave resonance of the entire test rig. Overall, the second acoustic mode shape is not much af- fected by the coupling with the ﬂame. The pure ( ) and the full ( ) system mode shapes are very similar. The ITA mode shape ( ) can only be visualized for the full system, because the pure intrinsic mode is just due to ﬂame dynamics and does not possess an acous- tic ﬁeld. It has features similar to both acoustic modes, which is remarkable given that the frequencies of the modes are so di ﬀerent. The pressure proﬁle is similar to the one of the second acoustic mode ( ), includ- ing the phase jump at the end of the plenum, whereas the velocity proﬁle seems closer to the one of the ﬁrst acoustic mode ( ). Thus it is di ﬃcult to distinguish the intrinsic mode from acoustic modes by comparing mode shapes. 6. Destabilization of ITA Modes by Acoustic Losses The investigations carried out in the previous chapters imposed a perfectly reﬂecting open end as downstream boundary condition. As mentioned by Tay-Wo-Chong et al, in experiment the test rig is terminated by a perforated plate instead, which results in less acoustic reﬂections, which implies more loss of acoustic power. Traditionally, it is assumed that this leads to a more sta- ble conﬁguration. In order to ﬁnd out whether this stabi- lizing eﬀect is realized, we carry out a parameter study of the changes in eigenvalue due to changes in the re- ﬂection coe ﬃcient at the combustor exit. It is varied between Rx = −1, which is a fully reﬂective open end and Rx = 0, a non-reﬂective boundary condition. The level in the experiment is bounded by those values. Figure 7 shows the eigenvalues of the full system as previously investigated (fully reﬂective open end Rx = −1, Eq. 7, Fig. 1). Eigenvalues of the full system at- tributed primarily to acoustic resonance ( ) and ITA feedback ( ) are indicated (compare with ( ) in Fig 5). As the reﬂections are gradually lowered, the eigenval- ues change and end up at positions denoted with a cross for the non reﬂective boundary condition (Rx = 0). As expected, the reduction of the downstream reﬂec- tion coeﬃcient has a stabilizing eﬀect on the two acous-.4 Acoustic and Intrinsic Thermoacoustic Modes of a Premixed Combustor −40 −20 0 200 Growth Rate (Hz) Frequency (Hz) Fig. 7: Eigenvalue shift due to changes in downstream reﬂection fac- tor. Fully reﬂective ( Rx = −1) open end: acoustic modes ( ), ITA modes ( ); Gradually lower reﬂections ( ) until non reﬂective ( ). tic modes of the system. The ﬁrst acoustic mode, which is a quarter wave mode, degenerates for a non reﬂective downstream boundary to a frequency of 0 Hz. Due to the plenum, the second acoustic mode remains resonat- ing, but is heavily damped. In contrast to the acoustic modes, the intrinsic mode is ampliﬁed and eventually becomes unstable as the re- ﬂection coeﬃcient Rx is reduced. Similar observations were made by in numerical simulations of laminar premixed ﬂames. In the common perception of ther- moacoustic instability, where only acoustic modes are considered to become unstable due to the driving by the ﬂame, this is a surprising result. Typically one would assume that less reﬂections relate to more acous- tic losses and therefore increased thermoacoustic stabil- ity. In closing it is mentioned that this result aligns with the assertion of that in the experiment this mode is unstable despite the low reﬂection coeﬃcient. 7. Conclusion The paper shows that the set of thermoacoustic eigen- modes of a premixed combustion test rig should be in- terpreted as the sum of acoustic and intrinsic thermoa- coustic (ITA) modes. The paradox that reducing acous- tic reﬂections at the boundaries may render a thermoa- coustic system unstable is explained by ITA feedback: increased losses damp acoustic modes, but may amplify an ITA mode. ITA feedback and the corresponding modes must be taken into consideration in comprehensive thermoa- coustic stability analysis. Note that this should not re- quire a reformulation of thermoacoustic models, be- cause typical implementations do consider all interac- tions that contribute to the ITA feedback loop. Re- sults of previous investigations of thermoacoustic in- stabilities, which have sometimes produced inexplica- ble eigenfrequencies or eigenmodes, should be revisited and re-interpreted under the perspective of ITA modes. The concept of intrinsic feedback and the associated eigenmodes is fairly general. It can be expected to ap- ply to diﬀerent combustion regimes and a wide range of phenomena related to sound generation and ampliﬁca- tion. For example, in practical premixed ﬂames acoustic waves generated by heat release ﬂuctuations can cou- ple with the fuel mixing process in an intrinsic manner. Similar feedback structures should exist for swirl ﬂuc- tuations. Intrinsic feedback may also contribute to aero- acoustic whistling. 8. Acknowledgment Financial support for S.

Besides being harmful for those exposed to elevated noise levels, combustion noise may trigger thermoacoustic instabilities. The imperative of avoiding thermoacoustic instabilities, in turn, limits the operational conditions of a combustion device. In turbulent conﬁned combustion systems, as they are found in most applied devices, the thermoacoustic stability and the noise levels reached are determined by an interplay of three main components: the combustion noise source, the ﬂame dynamic response to acoustic perturbations and the cavity acoustics. The present thesis deals with the thermoacoustic modeling of conﬁned combustion systems. Large eddy simulation is combined with advanced system identiﬁcation techniques to infer reduced order models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source. By incorporating the identiﬁed models into a linear acoustic network model description of the combustor acoustics, predictions are achieved of linear stability margins, combustor dynamics and sound pressure distributions. An extensive compari- son is conducted between the results obtained and experimental data provided from Laboratoire EM 2 C, Université Paris-Saclay. Via a reactive compressible large eddy simulation the experimentally measured sound pressure spectra of a conﬁned lab-scale combustor, which is located at Laboratoire EM 2 C, are precisely reproduced. Thereby, qualitative and quantitative agreement is found not only for thermoacoustically stable, but also for intermittent and fully unstable working conditions. The triggering of the instability is controlled solely by varying the length of the combustor exhaust tube, which is modeled in the compressible large eddy simulation through characteristic based state-space boundary conditions. Advanced system identiﬁcation techniques are investigated and evaluated, which allow to extend the es- tablished large eddy simulation / system identiﬁcation approach: not only a model for the ﬂame dynamic response is identiﬁed, but also an estimation of the combustion noise source is obtained from the same time series data. Surrogate data studies prove that compared with the established ﬁnite impulse response identiﬁcation, a Box-Jenkins model yields unbiased estimates for the ﬂame dynamic response in case of a closed-loop identiﬁcation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the additionally estimated noise model of the Box-Jenkins identiﬁcation converges towards a reference solution, even if the reference noise model is of simpler structure. Combining broadband time series data from the validated large eddy simulation and the investigated Box-Jenkins identiﬁcation, models are identiﬁed for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source. Incorporation of these models into a linear acoustic network model of a conﬁned com- bustor allows predictions of the combustor dynamics and its sound pressure distribution with reasonable computational effort. Satisfying agreement for the combustor scattering matrix is achieved between re- duced order model predictions and measured data. The employment of the reduced order model yields additionally excellent agreement to experimental values of the sound spectra and allows an intuitive inter- pretation in terms of cavity resonances and acoustic-ﬂame coupling. It is proven that the incorporation of iii the ﬂame dynamic response into the network model is mandatory for a correct sound pressure prediction. In summary, a coherent framework is presented for the investigation of combustor dynamics and combus- tor noise: broadband data are generated by a compressible large eddy simulation, which is post-processed via advanced system identiﬁcation techniques to infer simultaneously models for the ﬂame dynamic re- sponse and the generation of combustion noise. In the present thesis these models are combined with a linear acoustic network model to obtain a reduced order model that allows predictions of combustor dynamics and combustor noise across a large parameter space with reasonable computational costs. iv Kurzfassung Verbrennungslärm ist ein unerwünschtes, dabei jedoch unvermeidbares Nebenprodukt eines jeden tur- bulenten Verbrennungssystems. Neben dem schädlichen Einﬂuss auf jene, die erhöhten Schalldruck- pegeln ausgesetzt sind, kann Verbrennungslärm thermoakustische Instabilitäten auslösen. Das unabding- bare Vermeiden von thermoakustischen Instabilitäten wiederum begrenzt den Betriebsbereich des Ver- brennungssystems. Für geschlossene Verbrennungssysteme, wie sie praktisch in den allermeisten An- wendungen zu ﬁnden sind, bestimmt sich der erreichte Schalldruckpegel sowie die thermoakustische Stabilität des Systems durch das Zusammenspiel von Verbrennungslärmquelle, dynamischer Flammen- antwort auf akustische Störungen sowie akustischer Eigenmoden der Brennergeometrie. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der thermoakustischen Modellierung von geschlossenen Ver- brennungssystemen. Dazu werden Modelle reduzierter Ordnung abgeschätzt über einen kombinierten Ansatz aus Grobstruktursimulation und fortgeschrittener Systemidentiﬁkation. Durch Kopplung der identiﬁzierten Modelle mit einem linear akustischen Netzwerkmodell der Brennergeometrie werden V orhersagen getroffen über lineare Stabilitätsgrenzen, Verbrennungsdynamik und Schalldruckverteilung. Die erzielten Ergebnisse werden anschließend umfangreich validiert anhand experimenteller Daten, welche vom Laboratoire EM 2 C, Université Paris-Saclay, bereitgestellt werden. Mittels einer kompressiblen Grobstruktursimulation werden zunächst experimentell gemessene Lärm- spektren eines geschlossene Verbrennungsprüfstands präzise wiedergegeben. Dabei wird qualitative und quantitative Übereinstimmung nicht nur für thermoakustisch stabile Betriebsbedingungen erreicht, son- dern auch für intermittierende und instabile Bedingungen. Das Auftreten thermoakustischer Instabili- täten wird dabei ausschließlich durch die Länge des Abgasrohrs bestimmt, welches in der kompressiblen Grobstruktursimulation durch charakteristische Zustandsraum-Randbedingungen modelliert wird. Zudem werden fortgeschrittene Methoden der Systemidentiﬁkation auf Basis von Ersatzdaten untersucht und ausgewertet. Die untersuchten Methoden stellen dabei eine Erweiterung der bisher etablierten Meth- oden dar: neben einer dynamischen Flammenantwort wird zusätzlich von der selben Zeitreihe ein Mo- dell für die Verbrennungslärmquelle abgeschätzt. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass im Falle einer ‘closed- loop’ Identiﬁkation ein sogenanntes Box-Jenkins Modell keinen systematischen Fehler aufweist - im Gegensatz zu den bisher etablierten Modellen. Darüber hinaus wird demonstriert, dass das abgeschätzte Lärmquellenmodell der Box-Jenkins Identiﬁkation gegen ein vorgegebenes Referenzmodell konvergiert, selbst wenn das Referenzmodell eine einfachere Struktur aufweist. Durch Verknüpfung von breitbandig angeregten Zeitreihendaten, welche mittels der validierten Grob- struktursimulation erzeugt wurden, und der untersuchten Box-Jenkins Identiﬁkation werden letztlich Modelle für die dynamische Flammenantwort und für die Verbrennungslärmquelle bestimmt. In Kom- bination mit einem linear akustischen Netzwerkmodell ergibt sich ein Modell reduzierter Ordnung, das sich durch geringen rechnerischen Aufwand auszeichnet und V orhersagen über Verbrennungsdy- namik und zu erwartende Lärmspektren erlaubt. V orhergesagte und experimentell gemessene akustische Streumatrizen sind in guter Übereinstimmung. Desweiteren liefert das Modell reduzierter Ordnung her- v vorragende Übereinstimmung zu experimentell gemessenen Lärmspektren und ermöglicht darüber hin- aus eine verständliche Interpretation der resultierenden Spektren bezüglich akustischer Resonanzen und Flammen-Akustik Interaktion. Die Berücksichtigung der dynamischen Flammenantwort im akustischen Netzwerkmodell ist dabei Grundvoraussetzung für eine korrekte V orhersage des erreichten Schalldruck- pegels. Zusammengefasst wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit eine umfassende und in sich geschlossene Methode präsentiert, mit der sowohl die Verbrennungsdynamik als auch der Verbrennungslärm in geschlossen Verbrennungssystemen bestimmt werden kann: breitbandige Daten werden mittels einer kompressiblen Grobstruktursimulation generiert und anschließend anhand fortgeschrittener Systemidentiﬁkationsmeth- oden ausgewertet. Dadurch lassen sich gleichermaßen Modelle für die dynamische Flammenantwort und die Verbrennungslärmquelle identiﬁzieren. Durch Kombination mit einem akustische Netzwerkmodell wird ein Modell reduzierter Ordnung erlangt, welches V orhersagen über einen weiten Parameterbereich erlaubt bei gleichzeitig vertretbarem Rechenaufwand. vi Vorwort Die vorliegende Arbeit entstand während meiner Zeit an der Professur für Thermoﬂuiddynamik, TUM.

The development towards renewable but unsteady power generation requires readily avail- able back-up solutions, which should offer at the same time a distinct operational ﬂexibility. Modern gas turbines engines meet both requirements. Likewise, the increasing number of ﬂights per year cor- roborates the need for advanced combustion technologies that allow the design of efﬁcient aero-engines with low-emission of green-house gases, pollutants and noise. The recent development of gas turbine and aero-engine manufacturers aims for lean combustion systems, which come with low emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons or oxides of nitrogen. Unfortunately, lean combustion systems are prone to thermoacoustic instabilities in which a self-amplifying feedback estab- lishes between the unsteady heat release generated by the ﬂame and the acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations. This coupling between ﬂame and acoustics may yield considerable oscillations of the ﬂow variables. Pressure amplitudes reached during a thermoacoustic instability may cause severe damage to the engine such that the unconditional avoidance of thermoacoustic instabilities limits the operational ﬂexibility of engines. The generation and emission of combustion noise is another challenge for the development of gas tur- bines and aero-engines. Combustion noise, which is also closely linked to the unsteady heat release rate generated by the ﬂame, is an undesirable, but unavoidable by-product of every turbulent combustion process. Whereas the contribution of jet noise emitted by an aero-engine was reduced up to 10 d B over the last decades, the contribution of combustor noise has received less attention. Yet, combustion noise constitutes a signiﬁcant contribution to the overall sound emission of an aircraft at approach and cutback conditions. Besides harmful effects and annoyance to those being exposed to noise emissions, high levels of combustion noise may lead to structural excitations or even trigger thermoacoustic instabilities. For conﬁned turbulent ﬂames, as they are found in most applied combustion systems, two contributions to the combustion generated sound can be distinguished: On the one hand, turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations impinge upon the ﬂame and generate broadband heat release rate ﬂuctuations, which, in turn, act as a source of acoustic noise. On the other hand, acoustic waves perturb the ﬂame. In response to the acoustic perturbations the ﬂame generates additional heat release rate ﬂuctuations. Thereby, the acoustic waves perturbing the ﬂame depend strongly on the reﬂecting combustor conﬁnement. To optimize stability margins and noise emission of modern combustion devices, there is an increased interest in developing efﬁcient and ﬂexible prediction tools. In this context ‘ﬂexible’ means that changes in the combustor conﬁnement as well as changes in the noise source or the ﬂame dynamics are quickly realizable. If this is given, estimates of the stability margins and the sound pressure level are possible Introduction across a large range of parameters. The main objective of the present thesis is to build and evaluate efﬁcient and ﬂexible prediction tools for combustor dynamics and noise levels. Key elements of such prediction tools are accurate models for the noise source and the ﬂame dynamic response to acoustic perturbations. In the current thesis the simultaneous estimation of these models is achieved by combing Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with advanced System Identiﬁcation (SI) techniques. The identiﬁed models for noise source and ﬂame response are consequently incorporated into an acoustic low-order description of a conﬁned combustor. The resulting reduced order model allows not only computationally affordable predictions of combustor dynamics and noise across a large range of parameters, but also helps to gain a deeper understanding of the thermoacoustic processes involved in a turbulent conﬁned combustion system. Moreover, the reduced order model provides quantitative information on the uncertainty of the predictions in order to judge reliability and robustness of the obtained results. 1.02 Scope of the work Large parts of the present thesis emerge from the joint ‘Noise Dyn’project between the Laboratoire EM 2 C, Université Paris-Saclay, and the Thermo-Fluid Dynamics Group at Technische Universität München. The Noise Dyn project is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG PO 710/16-1) as well as by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-14-CE 35-0025-01) and deals with the ﬂame dynamics and the combustion noise characteristics of a conﬁned turbulent swirl combustor. The current thesis lays focus on the numerical modeling approach. Laboratoire EM 2 C commissioned the lab-scaled swirl combustor and provided experimental data to validate the results obtained from the numerical tools. This thesis pursues the modeling strategy illustrated in Fig. 1.01. As mentioned in the preceding section, an LES/SI approach is chosen to estimate models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source. The main concept of the LES/SI approach is to post-process broadband input-output time series data extracted from LES via SI techniques. This ‘black-box’ approach permits to infer models for the ﬂame response and the noise source from broadband time series data. Starting point of the LES/SI approach is the generation of broadband LES time series data, see ﬁrst step in Fig. 1.01. Next, data-driven models are identiﬁed for the ﬂame response and the combustion noise source. This is associated with the second step in Fig. 1.01. By combining the identiﬁed models with an acoustic description of a conﬁned combustor, predictions of the combustor dynamics and the combustion noise level are achieved. This constitutes the ﬁnal step in Fig. 1.01. The main ﬁndings of the current thesis were presented at conferences and in journals. Major publica- tions that summarize results of this dissertation are reproduced in the appendix. For a better readability throughout the manuscript the major publications are labeled. As shown in Fig. 1.01, each of these pub- lications is related to one step of the modeling strategy. P APER -LES focuses on the LES of the Noise- Dyn combustor to obtain a validated LES setup for the time series data generation. P APER -SI FTF and PAPER -SI N OISE propose an extension of the established LES/SI approach, which allows the simulta- neous identiﬁcation of ﬂame response and noise source. Consequently, P APER -SM, P APER -2 WAY, and PAPER -ROM combine the identiﬁed models with a linear network model of a conﬁned combustor and compare the predicted combustor dynamics and noise distributions with experimental data. The concept of this cumulative thesis is to guide through the major publications by summarizing only the most important results, highlighting the interconnection between the publications. Therefore, the fol- lowing structure is chosen: to clarify what is required to describe correctly combustion dynamics and combustion noise, chapter 2 provides the essential physical background. As three of the major publica- tions study the Noise Dyn test-rig, this test-rig is introduced in chapter 3 together with its operating con- 1.02 Scope of the work generation of input-output time series data reduced order model predictions of combustor dynamics and combustion noise identiﬁcation of data-driven models for ﬂame response and noise source PAPER -LES PAPER -SI FTF PAPER -SI N OISE PAPER -SM PAPER -2 WAY PAPER -ROM Figure 1.01: Modeling strategy chosen in the current thesis. ditions (Sec. 3.02) and the diagnostic tools available (Sec. 3.03). The subsequent chapters follow roughly the structure of the modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01. Chapter 4 deals with the compressible LES performed. Therein, the main outcome of P APER -LES is summarized in Sec. 4.03, the generation of broadband input-output data is covered in Sec. 4.04. The SI procedure is addressed in chapter 5, wherein the major ﬁndings from PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE are described in Sec. 5.04. Chapter 6 elu- cidates the linear network model approach used. Section 6.03 and 6.04 discuss brieﬂy the main results of PAPER -SM, P APER -2 WAY and PAPER -ROM. Chapter 7 gives a summary on the outcome of each pub- lication and presents an extended version of Fig. 1.01 to pay attention in particular to the interconnection between the individual publications. Finally, chapter 8 concludes the thesis and provides an outlook on a potential continuation research project. Introduction 2 Physical Background This chapter introduces the theoretical background and the essential concepts required for the overall understanding of the current thesis. Section 2.01 covers the basics of linear acoustics. Section 2.02 ad- dresses the origin and generation of combustion noise whereas Sec. 2.03 deals with the response of a ﬂame to acoustic perturbations, i.e. the ﬂame dynamic response. In this context also the mechanism be- hind thermoacoustic instabilities is elucidated, since their origin is closely related to the ﬂame dynamic response. As will become evident, combustion noise and ﬂame dynamics are strongly linked and can hardly be examined separately. Hence, Sec. 2.04 considers the interplay between combustion noise and ﬂame dynamics in a conﬁned combustor conﬁguration. 2.01 Linear acoustics Acoustic waves are small perturbations in pressure and velocity, propagating in a gaseous medium. The pressure p and the velocity u may be may be formulated as functions of mean and ﬂuctuating quantities p = ¯p +p′ and u = ¯u +u′ (2.01) herein, [¯·] denotes a reference quantity,[·]′ describes a ﬂuctuation around the reference value. The concept of linear acoustics is to limit the ﬂuctuating parts to small amplitudes compared with the reference value. This allows to neglect higher-order products of acoustic perturbations p′ and u′ without a signiﬁcant loss of generality. From the conservation equations of ﬂuid dynamics a formulation can be derived that describes the propagation of acoustic perturbations in gaseous medium, i.e. the wave equation. Assuming 1-D acoustics, as it would be the case for a plane wave propagating in a duct with constant cross-section, the wave equation reads as ∂2 p′ ∂t 2 −c 2 ∂2 p′ ∂x 2 = 0 (2.02) with c specifying the propagation speed of the acoustic perturbations, i.e. the speed of sound. For an ideal gas the speed of sound depends on the thermophysical properties of the gas and its temperature c = √ γRT (2.03) where γ and R describe the isentropic expansion factor and the speciﬁc gas constant, respectively. A solution of the hyperbolic partial differential equation shown in Eq. 2.02 is given by the characteristic waves, also known as Riemann Invariants f and g, which are deﬁned as f = 1 (p′ ¯ρ ¯c +u′ ) and g = 1 (p′ ¯ρ ¯c −u′ ) (2.04) herein, f and g represent acoustic waves traveling in opposite direction. Both characteristic waves prop- agate with the speed of sound c. From Eq. 2.04 the acoustic pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations can be retrieved u′ = f −g and p′ ¯ρ ¯c = f +g. (2.05) Physical Background Because the present thesis deals with acoustics in conﬁned conﬁgurations, an acoustic characterization of the boundaries is essential. One possibility is to formulate a complex reﬂection coefﬁcient R that describes modulus and phase between incident and reﬂected acoustic wave. Corresponding to the prop- agation direction of f and g, the upstream and downstream reﬂection coefﬁcients are deﬁned as Ru = f g and Rd = g f (2.06) 2.02 Combustion noise For a turbulent ﬂame one distinguishes betweendirect and indirect combustion noise. Direct combustion noise, on the one hand, originates from unsteady ﬂuctuations of the heat release rate due to the incoming turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld. These heat release rate ﬂuctuations, in turn, cause unsteady volumetric expansions of the gas across the reaction zone that ﬁnally result in acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations. Thus, the gen- eration of direct combustion noise is an inherent mechanism of turbulent ﬂames and is unavoidable. Consequently, several studies suggest to consider a turbulent ﬂame as a distributed acoustic monopole source [10–12]. Indirect combustion noise, on the other hand, is typical for technically premixed ﬂames. Equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations in the mixture upstream of the ﬂame may generate entropy ﬂuctuations in the burnt gas region. If these entropy ﬂuctuations are accelerated, for example across a chocked nozzle at the combustor outlet, acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations arise, which are referred to as indirect combustion noise. In the present thesis, however, only perfectly premixed ﬂames are studied, no mixture ratio ﬂuctuations are present upstream of the ﬂame. Therefore, the generation of direct combustion noise is the only noise source considered in the remainder of this thesis. To characterize the spectral source distribution resulting from direct combustion noise, a multitude of studies were conducted. It is generally recognized that the source distribution is of broadband type, with a colored spectral distribution : the magnitude of the combustion noise source increases in the low-frequency region towards a peak frequency, before it rolls-off again in the high-frequency region. This behavior is conﬁrmed experimentally in by systematic measurements of unconﬁned jet-ﬂames. Yet, when considering the combustion generated sound of turbulent ﬂames for conﬁned systems, a dis- tinct differentiation has to made compared with open systems. In open or unconﬁned conﬁgurations the acoustic pressure spectrum is strongly correlated with the source spectrum [7, 19–21]. In most en- gineering relevant applications, however, the ﬂame is enclosed by a combustor cavity, which exhibits strong acoustic reﬂections at the boundaries. This adds an additional degree of complexity. The broad- band acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations emitted by the ﬂame may excite an eigenmode of the surrounding cavity. This yields a resonant ampliﬁcation at a given eigenfrequency, which is perceivable as a moderate peak in the resulting sound pressure distribution. Consequently, the sound pressure distribution is no longer directly related to the source spectrum, but instead is modulated by the cavity acoustics. Fig. 2.01(a) illustrates schematically a resonating system. The turbulent ﬂame is represented as a noise source in terms of heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′. It is placed in a closed acoustic cavity that has a certain acoustic characterization depending on its reﬂection coefﬁcients upstream and downstream. Fig- ure 2.01(b) represents a typical spectral distribution of the noise source and the resulting sound pressure. The broadband noise source ˙Q′ generates a broadband distribution of acoustic waves (dotted line). This broadband forcing may excite, in turn, some of the cavity modes (vertical lines). The resulting sound pressure spectrum (red line) consequently exhibits moderate resonant peaks at the frequencies of the cavity modes. Thus, the cavity acoustics modulate the initial pressure distribution of the noise source such that the resulting sound pressure distribution differs from the noise source distribution. This would 2.03 Flame dynamic response and thermoacoustic instabilities not be the case for an unconﬁned system. The situation explained in regard to Fig. 2.01 is referred to as one-way coupling: the source excites the acoustics of the system, but the acoustic ﬁeld does not have any impact on the excitation or the source itself. In the present thesis this is understood as resonance. Rd f g Ru ˙Q′ (a) system sketch freq. SPL (b) sound pressure spectrum Figure 2.01: Left: schematic of a resonating system. Right: spectral sound pressure distribution (red) re- sulting from an acoustic broadband source (dotted line) that goes in resonance with acoustic eigenmodes of the system (vertical lines). 2.03 Flame dynamic response and thermoacoustic instabilities The ﬂame dynamic response, also referred to as combustion dynamics, describe the response of the ﬂame to upstream acoustic perturbations, i.e. the effect of the acoustic ﬁeld on the generation of heat release rate ﬂuctuations. If the fuel/air mixture is perfectly premixed or the fuel injection is stiff and its distance to the ﬂame is acoustically compact, the Flame Transfer Function (FTF) is sufﬁcient to fully describe the ﬂame response. The FTF relates upstream velocity ﬂuctuations at a given reference position to global heat release rate ﬂuctuations by G(ω) = u′ ref/ ¯u ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q (2.07) The FTF is a linear description that is valid only in the limit of small acoustic perturbations. If large amplitudes of acoustic perturbation are considered, the ﬂame response becomes non-linear, requiring consequently a non-linear ﬂame description such as the Flame Describing Function (FDF). To describe the FTF, a wide range of models with varying complexity can be found in literature. A ﬁrst simplistic modeling approach was proposed by Crocco, where the relation between u′ ref and ˙Q′ is characterized by a constant interaction indexn and a constant time delay τ. Polifke suggested the use of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model for a more detailed description of the ﬂame response. The coupling between ﬂame and acoustics, which is described by the FTF, may lead to a thermoacous- tic instability. If acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations and heat release rate ﬂuctuations are in phase, a self-amplifying feedback may establish between both contributions. This results usually in large oscilla- tions of the ﬂow variables, including strong pressure oscillations within the system. The ﬂame dynamic response, i.e. the FTF, is essential in this context as it characterizes the link between acoustic ﬂuctuations and heat release rate ﬂuctuations. Physical Background Figure 2.02(a) illustrates the modeling conception for acoupled system. In opposite to theresonant system depicted in Fig. 2.01, the acoustic source ˙Q′ is now coupled to the acoustic ﬁeld within the closed system. Note that this coupling is mandatory for a thermoacoustic instability to occur, but does not necessarily imply one. Fig. 2.02(b) shows a typical sound pressure distribution in case of an occurring thermoacoustic instability. Again, the broadband distribution of the acoustic noise source is indicated by the dotted line. Nevertheless, in case of thermoacoustic instability the resulting spectral sound pressure distribution is rather independent from the broadband source distribution. A sharp peak has to be expected at the fun- damental oscillation frequency of the thermoacoustic instability. The resulting sound pressure spectrum is no longer ‘noise dominated’ compared with the case shown in Fig. 2.01. Instead, its peak frequency depends mainly on the ﬂame dynamic response and the cavity acoustics. The amplitude of the sound pressure peak, in turn, is governed by effects of non-linear ﬂame saturation. The successional peaks ob- servable in the schematic sketch appear as higher harmonics, i.e. at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which is typical for non-linear systems. For completeness, however, it is remarked that the peaks occurring at the higher harmonics do not necessarily have be lower in amplitude as the peak at the fundamental frequency.

The broadband source (dashed line) only has a minor inﬂuence on the resulting sound pressure distribution. The situation explained in regard to Fig. 2.02 is referred to as two-way coupling. Compared with the one- way coupling illustrated in Fig. 2.01, the acoustic source is now coupled to the acoustic ﬁeld within the system. A mutual interaction between ﬂame and acoustics is established. 2.04 Interplay of combustion noise, ﬂame dynamics and cavity acoustics As alluded in the introduction and in the preceding two sections, the combustion generated sound within a conﬁned turbulent combustion system depends not exclusively on the combustion noise source itself, but instead also on the ﬂame dynamic response. Thereby, the two contributions cannot always be separated clearly such that the two spectra shown in Fig. 2.01(b) and Fig. 2.02(b) must be considered as idealized showcases for the respective contributions. In applied combustion systems the actual sound pressure distribution may show features of both contributions. Therefore, the current section further elucidates the interplay between combustion noise source, ﬂame response and cavity acoustics in a conﬁned system. Figure 2.03 illustrates schematically the interplay between combustion noise, ﬂame response and combus- tor conﬁnement. It can be considered as an extension of the previously shown ﬁgures 2.01(a) and 2.02(a). The gray box in Fig. 2.03 represents the ﬂame. The total heat release rate ﬂuctuations generated by the ﬂame ˙Q′ sum are described as the sum of two contributions: 1) a deterministic contribution ˙Q′ c that origi- 2.04 Interplay of combustion noise, ﬂame dynamics and cavity acoustics nates from the ﬂame response to upstream acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations u′ ref. 2) a stochastic contribution ˙Q′ s that depends mainly on the stochastic activity of the turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld. Whereas the ﬂame response ˙Q′ c is associated with the FTF, the second contribution ˙Q′ s describes a broadband noise source (similar to the dotted line in Fig. 2.01 and Fig. 2.02). It is anticipated at this point that conceptually the modeling of ˙Q′ sum as the sum of ˙Q′ c and ˙Q′ s is essential for the identiﬁcation of low-order models of the ﬂame response and the noise source. The according identiﬁcation procedure is described in detail in chapter 5. ˙Q′ s ˙Q′ c Rd ˙Q′ sum u′ ref fu gu Ru T T T T T T R R fd gd ITA noise source ﬂame response acoustic conv. f g Figure 2.03: Schematic of interplay between combustion noise source, ﬂame response and cavity acous- tics. The unsteady total heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ sum generate acoustic waves through an unsteady volu- metric gas expansion across the ﬂame such that the ﬂame can be seen as a source of sound. The conver- sion from heat release rate ﬂuctuations to acoustic waves is marked as ‘acoustic conv.’ in Fig. 2.03. In many applications the frequencies considered are low and acoustic waves may be described in good approximation as plane acoustic waves. Accordingly, the acoustic waves generated by the turbulent ﬂame propagate upstream (g) and downstream (f ) within the combustion system. Depending on the combustor geometry, transmission and reﬂection of acoustic waves occur at the individual combustor elements (noz- zles, area contractions, swirler element,). Figure 2.03 indicates transmission and reﬂection of acoustic waves by the boxes ‘T’ and ‘R’, respectively. When the acoustic wavesf and g reach the boundaries of the conﬁned setup, the acoustic waves do not leave the combustor. Instead, they are reﬂected back into the combustor depending on the reﬂection coefﬁcients Ru and Rd. This closes the outer acoustic loop of the system. In addition to the outer acoustic loop an internal feedback loop, the Intrinsic Thermo Acoustic (ITA) feedback loop [30–32], may be identiﬁed in Fig. 2.03, highlighted by the purple arrows. The chain of mechanisms within the ITA loop may be explained as follows: the unsteady heat release rate ﬂuctua- tions ˙Q′ sum generate upstream and downstream traveling acoustic waves. The upstream traveling wave g is transmitted up to the reference position, where it causes acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations u′ ref. The ﬂame response relates the generated acoustic perturbations u′ ref again to heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ c, which contribute to ˙Q′ sum and close consequently the ITA loop. Figure 2.03 clariﬁes that the ITA loop is independent of the acoustic boundary conditions Ru and Rd. Instead, the ITA loop is characterized by the ﬂame response and the transmission behavior of the combustor conﬁguration between ﬂame and reference position. Note that ITA feedback is a ﬂame inherent attribute and is thus always present. Yet, the strength of the ITA feedback may vary from case to case. In certain conﬁgurations this feedback causes a self-sustained thermoacoustic instability. In other cases it does not necessarily cause an instability, but Physical Background instead manifests itself as a resonance peak in the spectral sound pressure distribution. In only a minor impact is found from ITA feedback. The identiﬁed ITA feedback loop has also its implication for the publications of the current thesis. Due to the unavoidable internal feedback, the alluded identiﬁcation of reduced order models for noise source and ﬂame response results always in a closed-loop identiﬁcation problem. The ramiﬁcations of a closed-loop identiﬁcation are investigated in PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE. In addition to the outer acoustic loop, which is characterized by the combustor conﬁnement, the ITA loop has to be be considered as a contribution to the two-way coupling between ﬂame and acoustics, see discussion in Sec. 2.03. This means, in turn, that two-way coupling needs always to be taken into account, even for non-reﬂecting boundary conditions. The effect of two-way coupling and in particular of ITA feedback on the sound pressure spectrum of a conﬁned turbulent combustor is studied in PAPER -2 WAY. As mentioned in Sec. 1.01, the main objective of the current thesis is the formulation of a reduced or- der model that allows to determine the combustor dynamics and the sound pressure distribution within a conﬁned turbulent combustor. Thereby, the current thesis aims for a linear model, which allows the investigation of linear stability margins and the prediction of the sound pressure distributions for ther- moacoustically stable conﬁgurations. From the explanations given in this section it becomes evident that for this purpose accurate descriptions for three components are required: the ﬂame response, the noise source and the cavity acoustics. All three components mutually interact such that none of them can be neglected. 3 Conﬁned Swirl Combustion Test-Rig In the framework of the Noise Dyn project an experimental test-rig of a conﬁned premixed swirl com- bustor was constructed and commissioned at EM 2 C laboratoire, Université Paris-Saclay. Three of the publications reproduced in the appendix (P APER -LES, P APER -SM and P APER -ROM) deal with this test-rig. In each of these publications, however, different test-rig conﬁgurations and measurement di- agnostics are used and discussed. Therefore, this chapter provides an overview of the various test-rig conﬁgurations and the available diagnostic tools. Section 3.01 introduces the test-rig setup before the operating conditions are further speciﬁed in Sec. 3.02. Section 3.03 summarizes the diagnostic tools available and their measurement purpose. For a description of the experimental setup investigated in PAPER -2 WAY the reader is referred to. 3.01 Noise Dyn test-rig 265 94 146 108 220 220 plenum swirler+inj. tube comb. chamber exhaust MC ME’ ME” ME MP HW & MHW LDV CH 4/Air □82 ∅ 20 ∅ 65 ∅ 22 photomultiplier Figure 3.01: Sketch of Noise Dyn test-rig. The shaded area represents the part resolved within the LES domain. Dimensions are given in mm. Figure 3.01 depicts a sketch of the Noise Dyn test-rig. A methane/air mixture is injected via a tranquilliza- tion box (not shown in Fig. 3.01) at the upstream end of the plenum. By passing a honeycomb structure within the plenum, the ﬂow is laminarized before passing through a ﬁrst convergent part (contraction ratio: 8.073). Next, the mixture passes a radial swirler and the adjacent injection tube before entering the combustion chamber. Figure 3.01 represents only insufﬁciently the complex radial swirler geometry with its six off-centered swirler vanes. Hence, Fig. 3.02 depicts separately a detailed sketch of the radial swirler. In the combustion chamber the turbulent V-shaped ﬂame anchors at the central conical shaped bluff body tip and is stabilized by swirl. The combustion chamber conﬁnement walls are made out of quartz glass, granting optical access to the ﬂame. Burnt gases leave the combustion chamber through Conﬁned Swirl Combustion Test-Rig fd gd fu gu Figure 3.02: Detailed sketch of the radial swirler used in the Noise Dyn test-rig (reproduced from PAPER - SM). a square-to-round convergent part with a relatively small contraction ratio of 2.003. After the square-to- round convergent part an exhaust tube of variable length may be added optionally. The test-rig can be equipped with a loudspeaker at the bottom of the tranquillization box (not shown in Fig. 3.01). This allows to impose a monofrequent acoustic excitation of the ﬂow from upstream. 3.02 Operating conditions For the publications P APER -LES, P APER -SM and P APER -ROM identical ﬂow operating conditions were used. The perfectly premixed methane/air mixture has an equivalence ratio of φ = 0.082. The mix- ture has a bulk ﬂow velocity of ¯ub = 5.04 m/s after the ﬁrst convergent (HW in Fig. 3.01) and reaches consequently a bulk ﬂow velocity of ¯uinj = 7.01 m/s in the injection tube. With a diameter of D = 22 mm after the ﬁrst convergent this yields a Reynolds number of approximately Re = ub D/ν ≈ 7000. Never- theless, measurements show that the ﬂow remains laminar after the ﬁrst convergent at the measurement position HW: a top-hat velocity proﬁle forms with less than 2% relative velocity ﬂuctuations in the boundary layer and much lower ﬂuctuations within the core ﬂow. The inlet temperature is equal to 300 K, whereas the thermal power for the given operating conditions amounts to Pth = 5.05 k W. Regarding the acoustic boundary conditions, the combustor exit must not be considered as choked. The contraction ratio of the square-to-round convergent at the downstream end of the combustor is only small (2.003), yielding a mean combustor exit velocity of ¯ue = 2.08 m/s and a corresponding Mach number of Ma= 0.00043. For the termination of the combustor two different conﬁgurations can be realized: the combustor is either open-ended or a perforated plate may be installed. The perforated plate has the same outer diameter as the square-to-round convergent and a square pattern of 12 holes of radius r = 2.05 mm with an inter-hole spacing d = 20 mm. At the upstream end the combustor is terminated by a rigid wall. The length of the optional open-ended exhaust tube controls the thermoacoustic stability of the conﬁg- uration. Without an exhaust tube the system is thermoacoustically stable and no distinct self-sustained coherent ﬂame motion is detectable. The sound pressure level remains at moderate levels with a max- imum value of 117 d B. If an exhaust tube of length L = 220 mm is appended, the system becomes intermittently unstable, having an oscillation frequency of f = 205 Hz that reaches a peak amplitude of 138 d B. Further extending the exhaust tube to a length of L = 440 mm provokes a pronounced thermoa- coustic instability that reaches a stable limit cycle oscillation with an oscillation frequency of f = 185 3.03 Available diagnostics Hz corresponding to a 3/4 λ wave of the combustor, which is predominantly active in the combustion chamber. The peak amplitude of the fully unstable case is equal to 148 d B. Figure 3.03 shows the resulting sound pressure spectra within the combustion chamber. For the sound pressure spectrum of the stable conﬁguration no distinct tone emerges and the spectrum is broadband with a moderate peak that stems from a resonant cavity mode. This observation is in agreement with the modeling conception shown in Fig. 2.01. For the fully unstable conﬁguration, which is equipped with an exhaust tube of length L = 440 mm, the sound pressure spectrum is no longer broadband, but instead exhibits a distinct peak with smaller peaks at odd-numbered harmonics. Again, this is in accordance with the modeling conception introduced with Fig. 2.02. Note that if the exhaust is equipped with the perforated plate, all three conﬁgurations become stable. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,00050 f [Hz] SPL [d B] Figure 3.03: Experimentally measured sound pressure spectra for different open-ended exhaust tubes: no exhaust tube ( ), exhaust tube of length L = 220 mm ( ) and exhaust tube of length L = 440 mm ( ). 3.03 Available diagnostics The test-rig is equipped with various diagnostic tools. In the publications P APER -LES, P APER -SM and PAPER -ROM, however, different diagnostic tools are used and accordingly different measurement data are shown. For giving an overview, this section summarizes the diagnostic tools available and clariﬁes in which publication the respective experimental data are presented. For more detailed information on every diagnostic tool, the reader is referred to the individual publication reproduced in the appendix. A Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV in Fig. 3.01) is available to measure the ﬂow velocity at the com- bustion chamber entrance, 3 mm above the combustion chamber backplate. This provides an accurate local determination of the incoming ﬂow ﬁeld directly upstream of the turbulent swirl ﬂame. The LDV measures mean as well as root-mean-squared velocity proﬁles of axial, radial and circumferential veloc- ity. PAPER -LES contains the corresponding velocity proﬁles. From these velocity measurements a swirl number of S ≈ 0.08 is determined. A photomultiplier mounted with an interferometric ﬁlter measures OH* chemiluminescence, which is assumed to be proportional to the heat release rate for perfectly premixed ﬂames. This allows to record OH* images of the averaged turbulent ﬂame shape as well as phase-conditioned pictures of the ﬂame when submitted to an external acoustic forcing via the upstream loudspeaker. PAPER -LES presents Abel deconvoluted images of both averaged and phase conditioned ﬂame images. Conﬁned Swirl Combustion Test-Rig A hot-wire probe for velocity measurements (HW in Fig. 3.01) is installed in between the ﬁrst convergent and the radial swirler. The FTF can be determined by acoustically forcing the ﬂow via the upstream loudspeaker and simultaneously recording the signals of velocity ﬂuctuations at the hot-wire location and resulting OH* chemiluminescence ﬂuctuations. FTF measurements are reproduced in P APER -SM and PAPER -ROM. Multiple microphones are installed across the test-rig (see Fig. 3.01: MP, MHW, MC, ME, ME’, ME”). They are used to measure time traces of sound pressure ﬂuctuations - and accordingly spectral sound pressure distributions - as shown in P APER -LES and P APER -ROM. The microphones ME, ME’ and ME” at the downstream end of the combustor may additionally be used to reconstruct acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations via the three-microphone method. Together with the hot-wire probe HW and the mi- crophone MHW (both installed upstream) this allows the assessment of the acoustic variables p′ and u′ during upstream acoustic forcing. Consequently, the acoustic transfer matrix of the combustor can be determined by employing the two-load method. Since only upstream acoustic excitation is used in the test-rig, the two-load method is retained for determining the acoustic transfer matrix instead of the more frequently used two-source method [40–42]. P APER -SM presents the experimental results for the non-reactive and the reactive combustor scattering matrix, which are directly deduced from the transfer matrix measurements through simple algebraic transformation. The capability of the microphones ME, ME’ and ME” to reconstruct acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations is further exploited to measure gain and phase of the downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient. P APER -LES and PAPER -ROM contain measurements for both the open end and the perforated plate. The upstream re- ﬂection coefﬁcient has not been determined experimentally. Yet, the upstream plenum is terminated by a rigid wall such that the upstream reﬂection coefﬁcient may assumed to be equal to unity without any phase shift. Note that the studies [43–45], which investigated self-sustained combustion instabilities, used the same plenum conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 3.01. In these studies the upstream reﬂection coefﬁcient is also assumed to be fully reﬂective. Since the resulting model predictions in these works are in good agreement with measured data, it is concluded that the assumption of a fully reﬂective upstream end is valid. With the sum of these diagnostics a comprehensive set of experimental data is obtained, where the ﬂame response (i.e. the FTF), the spectral distribution of sound pressure within the combustor and the acous- tic boundary conditions are accurately quantiﬁed. An acoustic characterization of a turbulent combustor in this entirety is rare in literature. As elaborated in Sec. 2.04, however, such a complete characteriza- tion is crucially necessary for a proper comparison between measurements and the numerical modeling approaches developed. 4 Large Eddy Simulation of a Premixed Combustor Before models for the ﬂame response and the noise source may be determined via SI techniques, input- output data need to be generated. This corresponds to the ﬁrst step of the modeling strategy introduced in Fig. 1.01. In the current thesis a compressible reactive LES is chosen for the data generation step. The general concept of LES is to resolve directly the large turbulent structures within the ﬂow, which are often dependent on the speciﬁc geometry investigated. The small turbulent structures are more universal and hence not resolved directly, but instead modeled by a subgrid scale model. A compressible LES is particularly suited in the current study as it describes not only the turbulent reactive ﬂow but also takes into account all relevant acoustic mechanisms involved: the two-way acoustic-ﬂame interaction, the generation of combustion noise by resolved turbulent structures and the acoustic wave propagation in a complex geometry. Section 4.01 describes the LES setup of the Noise Dyn test-rig that is used in the publications P APER - LES, P APER -SM and P APER -ROM. Whereas in P APER -LES the LES is used to reproduce directly experimental measurements, it serves in PAPER -SM and P APER -ROM for the generation of broadband time series data that are consequently used for the SI procedure. Section 4.02 addresses brieﬂy the beneﬁt of coupling Characteristic Based State-space Boundary Conditions (CBSBC) with the LES since this is not only essential for the publications and PAPER -LES, but is used also in PAPER -SM and PAPER - ROM. Section 4.03 addresses the direct assessment of sound pressure spectra via compressible LES. By comparing the resulting LES spectra against measured spectra, the descriptions of ﬂame dynamics and generation of combustion noise are validated within the LES. The concluding section 4.04 illustrates the procedure for the generation of broadband input-output time series data via the compressible LES. Note that for the publications P APER -2 WAY, PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE the LES data used for the reference model identiﬁcation were provided from. 4.01 Noise Dyn LES setup The compressible reactive ﬂow solver A VBP, developed by CERFACS, Toulouse, is used for the LES computations of the Noise Dyn test-rig. The fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved on an unstructured grid by using the Lax-Wendroff scheme, which has a spatial and temporal ac- curacy of second order. Subgrid stresses are taken into account by the wall adapting linear eddy (W ALE) model without application of any wall-functions. The turbulence-ﬂame interaction is modeled by the dynamically thickened ﬂame model, ensuring that the laminar ﬂame thickness is resolved by seven cells. The chemistry of the premixed methane/air ﬂame is describe by the reduced two-step BFER scheme. Figure 3.01 indicates the extent of the LES domain. The LES resolves only the ‘core’ part of the com- bustion test-rig extending from upstream of the radial swirler to downstream of the combustion chamber. This delimitation of the computational LES domain saves computational costs and is applicable because Large Eddy Simulation of a Premixed Combustor complex ﬂow phenomena, which would need to be resolved via LES, are not expected in the upstream plenum or downstream of the combustion chamber. The acoustic impedances of the neglected combustor parts, however, need to be taken into account to guarantee a complete acoustic description of the test-rig. This is achieved by coupling the LES to CBSBC, as described in the subsequent section 4.02. The LES in- let coincides with the hot-wire probe location in experiments (denoted as HW in Fig. 3.01). As mentioned in Sec. 3.02, the ﬂow at this position is laminar with a top-hat velocity proﬁle. Thus, a laminar velocity block proﬁle is imposed at the LES inlet with a bulk velocity of ¯uin = 5.04 m/s. Atmospheric pressure of ¯pout = 1 atm is set at the LES outlet. The unstructured LES grid used consists of approximately 19 million tetrahedral cells. The mesh is reﬁned in the reaction zone region with a maximum cell size of 0.06 mm. A maximum cell size of 0.08 mm is used within the complex burner geometry upstream of the ﬂame, which contains the radial swirler and the injection tube. The radial swirler is fully described by the computational mesh, meaning that no geometrical simpliﬁcation are applied. Each of the six radial swirler vanes has a diameter of 6 mm and is resolved by approximately 18 cells, which are reﬁned towards the walls. To keep the computational effort on a reasonable level, the mesh resolution in the burnt gas region downstream of the ﬂame is coarsened by allowing a maximum cell size of 1.04 mm. This coarsening is permissible since less complex ﬂow dynamics are expected in the burn gas region due to the elevated viscosity and the relatively simple geometry. As one objective of the compressible LES is to reproduce correctly the ﬂame response and the generation of combustion noise, an obligatory test is the comparison between measured and computed velocity pro- ﬁles directly upstream of the ﬂame. The mean velocity ﬁeld is essential for the mean ﬂame shape, which has a direct impact on the ﬂame response. The incoming turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations that impinge on the ﬂame front are strongly linked to the generation of combustion noise. A comparison between the LDV measurements described in Sec. 3.03 and the computed velocity proﬁles from LES for mean and ﬂuctuating values exhibits an overall good agreement (see P APER -LES). This comparison proves that the LES setup chosen is able to precisely describe the ﬂow ﬁeld directly upstream of the ﬂame - a pre- requisite for further investigations. In particular the generation of turbulence and swirl across the radial swirler, located in between LES inlet and combustion chamber entrance, are reproduced correctly by the LES. Regarding subgrid scale modeling and wall treatment, it is worth mentioning that different combinations were tested. Thereby, it is found that the W ALE model applied without any wall-functions provides overall the best agreement with experimental data. This observation is in accordance with. When using wall-functions in combination with the W ALE model, the ﬂuctuating velocity components are overestimated. After the validation of velocity proﬁles upstream of the ﬂame, mesh independence in regard to the gen- eration of combustion noise is afﬁrmed. Compared to the reference mesh with its 19 million cells one coarser and one ﬁner mesh are tested, which have approximately 11 million and 34 million cells, respec- tively. The mesh resolution in the burnt gas region is kept constant and the coarsening / reﬁning is applied only on the reaction zone and the upstream region as they are assumed to be essential for the generation of combustion noise. It is found that for all three mesh resolutions the resulting sound pressure spectrum is comparable, see Fig. 4.01. Hence, the LES results for the sound pressure spectra are assumed to be mesh-independent. For a more detailed description of the mesh study performed the reader is referred to PAPER -LES. One uncertainty in the LES setup arises from the wall temperatures, since experimental values are not available due their cumbersome accessibility. For the publications PAPER -LES, P APER -SM and PAPER - ROM, which all deal with the Noise Dyn setup, a set of wall temperatures is used that yields the same global heat loss as the experimental conﬁguration. This is validated by comparing the mean combustor 4.01 Noise Dyn LES setup 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,00050 f [Hz] SPL [d B] Figure 4.01: Sound pressure spectra from LES computed with different mesh resolutions: reference mesh with 19 million cells ( ), coarse mesh with 11 million cells ( ) and ﬁne mesh with 34 million cells ( ). exit temperatures in experiment and LES. A detailed discussion of the effects of the respective wall temperatures, however, is not provided in any of the publications and is therefore given in the following. For the injection tube and the swirler adiabatic walls are assumed because the inlet gas temperature is approximately equal to the ambient temperature. The lateral conﬁnement walls of the combustion chamber and the square-to-round convergent part represent the biggest area portion in the burnt gas region. The heat loss across these boundaries has a major impact on the mean bulk ﬂow temperature and hence the mean speed of sound in the burnt gas region. This, in turn, affects the eigenmodes of the combustor cavity. For the subsequent LES based prediction of sound pressure spectra within the combustion chamber this results in a shift of the peak frequency. In particular for an unstable working condition this may also have a signiﬁcant impact on the limit cycle oscillation amplitude. In the present setup heat loss boundary conditions are used for the lateral combustion chamber walls. Together with a thermal resistance of the quartz walls, experimentally determined values of the outside wall temperature are imposed as reference temperature. This yields a spatially non-uniform wall temperature distribution that adapts to the internal temperature ﬁeld. Moreover, it is observed that the lateral wall temperatures have only a minor impact on the ﬂame shape and hence on the ﬂame dynamic response, i.e. the FTF. The wall temperatures of the combustor back plate and of the bluff body tip, however, are found to have a strong impact on the FTF. With increasing combustor back plate temperature the ﬂame shape gradually changes from a V-shaped to a M-shaped ﬂame. The M-shaped ﬂame anchors additionally at the outer rim of the injection tube. As a result of this gradual change, the ﬂame length is decreasing, which impacts primarily the phase of the resulting FTF: the shorter the ﬂame length, the steeper the phase decay. The bluff body tip temperature controls the stand-off distance between ﬂame and bluff body and is important for the ﬂame anchoring and the ﬂame root behavior. It is found that a large bluff body tip temperature results in a short stand-off distance between bluff body tip and ﬂame root. In this case the ﬂame is well anchored. From these observations it is deemed that variations of the bluff body tip temperature have an impact on gain and phase of the FTF. For numeric values of the respective wall temperatures in the LES setup the reader is referred to PAPER - LES. Large Eddy Simulation of a Premixed Combustor 4.02 Coupling of LES with characteristic based state-space boundary con- ditions As argued in Sec. 2.04, the sound pressure spectrum in a conﬁned combustor setup depends crucially on the acoustic characteristics of the surrounding cavity. A proper validation of computed sound pressure spectra is thus possible only if the cavity acoustics are fully taken into account in the LES. The most natural approach would be to resolve directly the complete combustor conﬁguration within the LES domain, meaning from upstream plenum to downstream exhaust. Yet, Fig. 3.01 shows that the LES domain chosen resolves only the part from upstream swirler to downstream combustion chamber in order cut down computational costs. To ensure nonetheless a complete description of the acoustic cavity as it is found in experiments, the LES is coupled to CBSBC. These boundary conditions allow to impose complex reﬂection coefﬁcients at the boundaries to model acoustic systems adjacent to the LES domain. Figure 3.01 clariﬁes that the upstream plenum and the downstream exhaust tube are not resolved within the LES domain, hence they are modeled acoustically via CBSBC instead. For an extensive and complete description of the CBSBC the reader is referred to or PAPER -LES. Besides providing boundary impedances for an accurate description of the acoustics within the LES domain, CBSBC also make possible to reconstruct the sound pressure spectra at locations outside of the LES domain. The state-space model of the CBSBC retains spatial information. Accordingly, P APER - LES assesses the sound pressure at the microphone locations MP or ME (see Fig. 3.01), although these locations do not lie within the LES domain. This is achieved by an additional post-processing step: the boundary state-space model is simulated forward in time with the characteristic wave leaving the LES domain as input signal. Note that the assessment of pressure ﬂuctuation outside the LES domain would not be possible with other time domain impedance boundary conditions as used e.g. in. Compared with the formulation of the well established Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Condition (NSCBC), which exhibits acoustic reﬂections in the low frequency range, the CBSBC are fully non-reﬂective, even in the low frequency limit. This is achieved by making use of a wave masking technique. PAPER -SM and PAPER -ROM exploit this property to ensure fully non-reﬂective boundary conditions. Note that in a prior study the CBSBC are applied to a laminar case. Therein, the CBSBC are used to model an upstream plenum of variable length whereas the ﬂame and its vicinity are resolved by a compressible CFD. The length of the plenum modeled controls the thermoacoustic stability of the laminar slit burner: the longer the plenum, the larger the occurring oscillation amplitudes. This study proves two essential aspects that are of importance for the sound pressure prediction of the Noise Dyn test-rig. First, a change of the impedance modeled by CBSBC may be enough to trigger thermoacoustic instabilities. Second, it is demonstrated that the acoustics can be treated linearly also in case of a strong non-linear thermoacoustic oscillation. Consequently, the non-linearity can be attributed to hydrodynamic effects and ﬂame dynamics, which are both resolved via the compressible CFD. 4.03 Sound pressure prediction in the Noise Dyn test-rig Section 4.01 illustrated that the LES reproduces correctly the velocity ﬁeld upstream of the ﬂame and that the resulting sound pressure spectra are mesh independent. Section 4.02 described how to model efﬁciently the unresolved acoustic parts upstream and downstream of the LES domain. Yet, it is still unclear if the computed sound pressure spectra are physically correct, i.e. if they are in agreement with experiments. The successful validation of the LES against experimental data is essential for further investigations, 4.03 Sound pressure prediction in the Noise Dyn test-rig which are based on the compressible LES data. Therefore, P APER -LES assesses the spectral sound pressure distribution in the Noise Dyn setup for stable and unstable working conditions and compares results with measurement data. This section presents only one of the main results from PAPER -LES. The focus is thereby laid on the implications of this result for the following investigations and publications. The fully reproduced publication can be found in the appendix of this thesis. As explained in the preceding section 4.02, the CBSBC are used in P APER -LES to model the acoustic impedance of the upstream plenum and of the part downstream from the square-to-round convergent. Whereas the upstream impedance model remain unchanged - a fully reﬂective end with a constant phase lag that is deﬁned by the plenum length - different downstream impedances are studied. The exhaust tubes used are always open-ended but differ in their length. This means that the absolute value of the downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient is in good approximation always equivalent to the analytically pre- dicted values for an open unﬂanged tube. The phase values, however, depend on the exhaust tube length and the speed of sound within the exhaust tube. Recalling the explanations given in Sec. 3.02, without exhaust tube the conﬁguration is stable, with an exhaust tube of L = 440 mm a fully developed limit cycle oscillation is obtained. When modeling the particular impedances via CBSBC, excellent agreement is found between LES and measurements, see ﬁgure 4.02. 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,00050 f [Hz] SPL [d B] (a) stable 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,00050 f [Hz] SPL [d B] (b) fully unstable Figure 4.02: Sound pressure measurements ( ) and LES results for the stable ( ) and the fully un- stable ( ) conﬁguration (reproduced from PAPER -LES). As argued previously in Sec. 2.02, the spectrum of the stable conﬁguration has a rather broadband dis- tribution. It is dominated by the combustion source characteristics, subsequently modulated by cavity resonances. A linear network model analysis conducted later in P APER -ROM reveals that the moderate peak observable in this conﬁguration stems from a resonant combustion chamber mode. The spectral sound pressure distribution for the unstable conﬁguration, however, exhibits distinct peaks. This spec- trum is inﬂuenced not only by the noise source, but instead depends strongly on the ﬂame dynamics, which are the governing mechanism during a thermoacoustic instability. The peak in the sound pres- sure spectrum occurs at the oscillation frequency of the thermoacoustic instability. Non-linear saturation effects, which are accounted for in the LES, control the amplitude of the pressure peak. The LES reproduces accurately both stable and unstable conﬁgurations. In turn, this suggests strongly that both aspects, i.e. the combustion noise source as well as the ﬂame dynamics, are described precisely by the compressible LES. In the framework of the current thesis this is an important aspect. Because the LES/SI procedure yields data-driven models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise Large Eddy Simulation of a Premixed Combustor source, physically correct models can only be estimated if the responsible mechanisms are correctly reproduced by the LES. If the SI procedure is fed with erroneous data from the LES, erroneous model estimations result. The successful validation of the LES against measurements of the sound pressure distribution ensures that the LES setup can be used for the generation of broadband input-output time series data. Subsequently, the broadband time series data from LES are post-processed via SI techniques to estimate reduced order models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source. 4.04 Generation of broadband time series The following section explains the procedure of generating input-output time series data via acoustic forcing of the LES. This corresponds to the ﬁrst step of the modeling strategy introduced in Fig. 1.01. Focus is laid in this section on the LES relevant aspects in regard to acoustic forcing. For the implications of different forcing parameters on the SI procedure itself the reader is referred to Sec. 5.01. The general concept is to impose an acoustic excitation signal at the LES domain boundaries. At the inlet a characteristic wave fin is imposed, whereas at the outlet a characteristic wave gout is applied. Thereby, for example an ingoing wave fin should be regarded as an input signal that causes a certain system response, e.g. heat release rate ﬂuctuations across the ﬂame ˙Q′ or an outgoing characteristic wave fout. The system under study may be characterized from its response to the input signal. By using a mono- frequent excitation signal, as it is usually done in an experimental approach, the transfer behavior of a system at a given excitation frequency can be directly determined from its response at that same fre- quency. Instead of forcing the system mono-frequently, one may excite the system with a broadband forcing signal, which contains spectral energy not only at one discrete frequency, but instead across a speciﬁed frequency range. From the resulting broadband input-output time series data the transfer be- havior of the system can be directly estimated across a complete frequency range via the use of SI techniques (see chapter 5). Compared to repeated mono-frequent excitation across a certain frequency range, the broadband forcing technique reduces the computationally effort signiﬁcantly in LES and yields a transfer function that is valid in the complete complex plane ( ω ∈ C). The determination of the trans- fer behavior of a system across a given frequency range via mono-frequent excitation would be rather expensive in LES, as for every excitation frequency multiple forcing cycles need to be computed. Different signal types are possible for broadband excitation. The present thesis, in particular P APER - SM and P APER -ROM, use a broadband signal that is based on Daubechies wavelets. This signal type offers certain advantages for the use in LES. First, the amplitude of the signal is bounded. Other than a random Gaussian White Noise signal, no amplitude values above a certain threshold value are present in the Daubechies wavelet signal. This ascertains that no non-linear ﬂame response is triggered unintentionally by the input forcing. Second, its spectral energy content is constant up to a certain cut-off frequency above which the spectral energy content monotonically decreases. Third, the broadband signal used is continuous. Even though a Pseudo Random Binary Signal would also be bounded in amplitude, its discrete amplitude distribution causes numerical difﬁculties if applied in LES. Overshoots result in the actual input signal, which impede the subsequent identiﬁcation. Figure 4.03 depicts a typical time series generated by LES with applied broadband forcing. The input quantity u′ causes in the LES a certain ﬂame response in terms of ˙Q′, which is considered as output. By post-processing this input-output time series data set via advanced SI techniques, a causal relation between u′ and ˙Q′ may be formulated, i.e. the FTF, as well as a model for the generation of combustion noise. This will be further explained in Sec. 5.05. 4.04 Generation of broadband time series 0 0.01 0.02 0.03−0.04 −0.02 0.02 0.04 t [s] u′/ ¯u (a) input 0 0.01 0.02 0.03−0.04 −0.02 0.02 0.04 t [s] ˙Q′/ ¯˙Q (b) output Figure 4.03: LES generated broadband input-output time series data.

Large Eddy Simulation of a Premixed Combustor 5 System Identiﬁcation in Thermoacoustics The ﬁrst step of the modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01 is carried out by generating broadband input- output time series data via a compressible LES. The subsequent step deals with the identiﬁcation of data-driven models for ﬂame response and noise source. Therefore, advanced SI techniques are applied in this thesis. This chapter introduces the required background information on SI in general and explains the SI tech- niques used. After a short overview on SI, the three essential steps of the identiﬁcation procedure are discussed: generation of broadband data (Sec. 5.01), choice of model structure (Sec. 5.02) and model co- efﬁcient estimation (Sec. 5.03). Therein, attention is paid on the comparison between the established FIR identiﬁcation and the more advanced Box-Jenkins (BJ) identiﬁcation. It is shown that the BJ identiﬁca- tion is suited in particular in the framework of the current thesis as it allows the simultaneous identiﬁ- cation of reduced order models for the ﬂame response, i.e. the FTF, and the combustion noise source. Section 5.04 summarizes the main outcome of the two surrogate data studies performed in PAPER -SI FTF and PAPER -SI N OISE before in Sec. 5.05 the investigated SI techniques are applied on actual LES data of the Noise Dyn conﬁguration. Methods for SI originate from the ﬁeld of control theory [63–65] and may be considered as a combination of different theories, such as estimation theory, signal processing and system theory. The overall objective of SI is described by Keesman as ‘ the construction of mathematical models of the system under study based on noisy time series ’. The ‘mathematical models’ in this context are often referred to as transfer functions, which should precisely describe the input-output behavior of a given system. From a system theory perspective the FTF may be seen as a linear transfer function that relates upstream velocity perturbations at a given reference position u′ ref to resulting heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ c. By recalling Fig. 2.03 and the underlying modeling principle of summing a deterministic contribution ˙Q′ c and a stochastic contribution ˙Q′ s, the most general description of a linear time invariant system that describes the total heat release rate ˙Q′(t) as an output is given by ˙Q′(t) =G ·u′ ref(t)   ˙Q′ c + H ·e(t)   ˙Q′ s (5.01) herein, the so-called plant model G may be associated with the FTF since it establishes a causal relation between the input signal u′ ref(t) and the heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′(t). It describes thus the deter- ministic contribution ˙Q′ c, which stems from upstream acoustic perturbations. The noise model H, with its generic Gaussian White Noise input term e(t), describes the stochastic contribution ˙Q′ s to the global heat release rate ˙Q′(t). This contribution may be associated with the combustion noise contribution and is understood to be uncorrelated to any incoming acoustic perturbations. Figure 5.01 represents graphically Eq. (5.01). Note that this representation corresponds clearly to the mod- eling principle of the ﬂame contributions shown in Fig. 2.03. In an actual combustor colored turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations cause a certain spectral distribution of ˙Q′ s. In the modeling approach of Fig. 5.01 this effect is mimicked by ﬁltering a generic Gaussian White Noise input term e(t) through the noise model H in order to obtain directly the same spectral distribution of ˙Q′ s, as it would have been caused by turbu- lent velocity ﬂuctuations in an actual combustor. The noise model H contains thus physical information of the system.

Objective of the SI procedure is then to estimate descriptions of the plant model G and the noise model H. The necessary procedure may be divided into three main steps: 1) generation of broadband data 2) choice of model structure and 3) solution of an optimization problem to ﬁnd the model coefﬁcients, which describe best the input-output time series data. In the following three sections these steps are brieﬂy covered. 5.01 Properties of broadband data As described in Sec. 4.04, a compressible LES is used in the current thesis for the generation of broadband time series data. Whereas the aspects relevant for the LES were already described in Sec. 4.04, this section discusses the implications of different time series properties on the subsequent SI procedure. The main properties of the broadband time series data are the cut-off frequency, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the time series length. The inﬂuence of the latter two is studied among other aspects in PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE. The cut-off frequency of the excitation signal determines up to which frequency the transfer behavior of the system may be inferred. Estimations for the frequency response of a system are only possible for frequencies that are contained in the excitation signal. Consequently, a large cut-off frequency yields a large validity range of the identiﬁed models. A large cut-off frequency of the broadband excitation signal, however, results also in a wide spread of spectral energy, which decreases the identiﬁcation accuracy. Thus, as a best practice the cut-off frequency should be chosen as high as necessary, but not higher. Fortunately, ﬂames usually exhibit a low-pass behavior and combustion noise is known to be active predominantly in the low frequency region. Consequently, the works PAPER -SM and PAPER -ROM use a maximal cut-off frequency of 1000 Hz. The excitation signal amplitude determines the SNR of the time series data, since the noise source strength usually cannot be controlled. Generally, a high SNR results in accurate model estimations. Yet, a trade-off has to be made regarding the SNR. If the excitation amplitude is chosen too large, it may trig- ger a non-linear ﬂame response, which cannot be handled by the linear identiﬁcation techniques used. Therefore, in the publications PAPER -SM and P APER -ROM a forcing amplitude equivalent to 10 % of the mean inﬂow velocity is chosen to achieve a favorable SNR by ensuring at the same time a linear ﬂame response. Regarding the identiﬁcation error and the identiﬁcation uncertainties, a strong dependence is recog- nized on the time series length available. Based on surrogate data PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE demonstrate that the identiﬁcation error and the identiﬁcation uncertainty decrease with increasing time series length. Yet, LES computations for the time series generation are computationally demanding such that the time series length is usually limited. In PAPER -SM and PAPER -ROM an LES time series length 5.02 Choice of model structure of 350 ms is used for the subsequent identiﬁcation, which yields for the gain of the FTF a 95 % con- ﬁdence interval that ranges approximately in between ±0.02. Phase values of the identiﬁed FTF exhibit usually signiﬁcantly smaller conﬁdence intervals. The impact of the identiﬁcation uncertainty in the FTF on stability margins and growth rates of a thermoacoustic system is studied in. 5.02 Choice of model structure After the input-output data are generated, a certain model structure needs to be chosen. By expanding in Eq. (5.01) the plant model G and the noise model H in terms of polynomial ﬁlters, the most general polynomial model structure reads as A(q,θ) ˙Q′(t,θ) = B(q,θ) F(q,θ) u′ ref(t) + C(q,θ) D(q,θ) e(t) (5.02) herein A,B,C,D and F are polynomials in time shift operator q−i deﬁned as q−i u′(t) = u′(t −i∆t) (5.03) Thus, the respective polynomial ﬁlters result in A(q) = 1 +a 1 q−1 +a 2 q−2. ana q−na B(q) = b 0 +b 1 q−1 +b 2 q−2. bnb q−nb C(q) = 1 +c 1 q−1 +c 2 q−2. cnc q−nc D(q) = 1 +d 1 q−1 +d 2 q−2. dnd q−nd F(q) = 1 +f 1 q−1 + f 2 q−2. fnf q−nf The difference between [ B(q,θ), C(q,θ) ] and [ D(q,θ), F(q,θ) ] is that [ B(q,θ), C(q,θ) ] relate prior inputs to the current output whereas [ D(q,θ), F(q,θ) ] take prior outputs into account and can describe consequently possible auto-regressive behavior. The individual model coefﬁcients in the parameter vector θ θ = {a 1.ana,b 0.bnb,c 1.cnc,d 1.dnd, f 1.fnf } weight the relation between current as well as prior inputs and output samples. Therein, the respective model orders na,nb,nc,nd and nf specify the number of prior samples that are taken into consideration. Concluding, this means that the current output on the left-hand side of Eq. (5.02) is computed from a convolution of the polynomial model coefﬁcients with prior inputs and outputs. The amount of prior time series samples that are taken into account is determined by the model order. When comparing Eq. (5.01) and Eq. (5.02), it becomes evident that the polynomial ﬁlters B(q,θ)/F(q,θ) describe the plant model G whereas C(q,θ)/D(q,θ) specify the noise model H. By including or ex- cluding some of the polynomial ﬁlters A,B,C,D and F, different model structures of varying complexity may be deduced from the general model structure shown in Eq. (5.02). The remainder of this section discusses in detail two speciﬁc model structures with respect to their capability of describing the plant model G and the noise model H. On the one hand, the well established FIR model structure is examined, which is applied on LES data in P APER -SM and P APER -2 WAY. On the other hand, the more general BJ model structure is introduced, as it allows the additional identiﬁcation of a model for the combustion noise source. PAPER -ROM applies a BJ model identiﬁcation on broadband LES data from the Noise Dyn conﬁguration. System Identiﬁcation in Thermoacoustics The FIR model structure is retained from the general model structure shown in Eq. (5.02) by setting the polynomial ﬁlters A,C,D and F equal to unity ˙Q′(t,θ) = B(q,θ)u′ ref(t) +e(t). (5.04) In this case, the output ˙Q′ is computed by a simple convolution of the model coefﬁcients θ = {b 0, b 2, bnb } with prior inputs u′ ref(t). The FIR is widely used to model the ﬂame dynamic response [47, 68–78]. By setting C(q,θ) = D(q,θ) = 1, however, no noise model H is estimated. Consequently, the noise contribution is assumed to be Gaussian White Noise. For laminar ﬂame conﬁgurations in which no turbulent combustion noise is present, this might be a valid assumption. Yet, a turbulent ﬂame, as it is studied in the framework of the current thesis, exhibits turbulent combustion noise, which is known to be colored. Deploying a FIR model structure for the identiﬁcation of a turbulent ﬂame does not provide any estimates of the colored noise contribution. Moreover, assuming erroneously a colored noise contribution to be white, introduces a bias into the plant model identiﬁcation, see P APER -SI FTF and PAPER -SI N OISE. The more general BJ model structure may be considered as an extension of the FIR model structure and is retained from Eq. (5.02) by setting only A(q,θ) equal to unity ˙Q′(t,θ) = B(q,θ) F(q,θ) u′ ref(t) + C(q,θ) D(q,θ) e(t). (5.05) Compared with the FIR model structure, the BJ model structure includes also the polynomial ﬁlters C(q,θ) and D(q,θ) and provides thus a description for the noise model H. Consequently, it allows to model a colored noise contribution ˙Q′ s. The BJ model structure identiﬁcation was already applied suc- cessfully in the ﬁeld of aeroacoustics. Therein, the BJ model structure was deployed in an LES/SI approach to identify the scattering matrix and a respective aeroacoustic noise model of an oriﬁce conﬁgu- ration with mean ﬂow. Excellent agreement to experimental data was found. In the ﬁeld of thermoacous- tics, however, only an exploratory study on laminar ﬂames was conducted yet. Therein, stochastic combustion noise was mimicked by imposing an ‘unknown’ equivalence ratio ﬂuctuation. For completeness it is mentioned that also other model structures such as an Autoregressive model with e Xogenous input (ARX) or an Output-Error (OE) model may be deduced from the general model struc- ture shown in Eq. (5.02). Yet, only the FIR model and the BJ model are applied on LES data in the current thesis (PAPER -SM, P APER -2 WAY and PAPER -ROM). The behavior of the ARX model is explored on the basis of surrogate data in PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE and is found to be inferior to the BJ model for the present application. 5.03 Model coefﬁcient estimation After a certain model structure is chosen, the polynomial model coefﬁcients contained in θ need to be estimated. This is achieved by a solving a least-squares optimization problem of the form min θ J(θ) ≡ min θ N N−1∑ i=0 ( ˙Q′(i∆t,θ) − ˙Q′(i∆t) )2 (5.06) herein, the cost function J(θ) is minimized by reducing the squared error between the modeled output ˙Q′(i∆t,θ) and the actual output ˙Q′(i∆t) of the time series used. The set of model coefﬁcients that describes best the input-output behavior yields the lowest value of the cost function J(θ). Depending on the chosen model structure, the optimization problem may become non-linear. Also a regularization of the optimization problem may be applied, which reduces the variance of the estimated coefﬁcients at 5.04 Surrogate data study the cost of model ﬂexibility. Yet, for details on both of these aspects the reader is referred to P APER -SI NOISE. It is emphasized at this point that the estimated models result from a mere ‘black-box’ approach: the identiﬁed model is not determined by analytical derivation from the underlying governing equations of the problem. Instead, its input-output transfer behavior is deduced solely from an error minimization between modeled and actual output. Hence, for the identiﬁcation of the purely data-driven models no prior knowledge of the system itself is necessary. Even though data-driven models crucially require accurate input-output time series data, this property may also be regarded as an advantage. Compared to noise models that are based on a Strouhal number scaling or a temporal correlation analysis, data-driven models are more general: they do not rely on any physical modeling assumptions such as the deﬁnition of a characteristic ﬂame length and are not limited to a certain ﬂame shape or similar. 5.04 Surrogate data study Before applying the SI techniques directly on actual LES data, a better understanding of their behavior and their applicability would be helpful. In particular for the BJ model identiﬁcation and the correspond- ing combustion noise model estimation only limited experience is available. Therefore, two studies based on surrogate data were conducted in P APER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE to investigate the behavior of different model structures in a thermoacoustic context. These two studies should be regarded as an intermediate step before applying the SI techniques on actual LES data and may be associated with the second step of the modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01. The surrogate data in PAPER -SI FTF an P APER -SI N OISE are generated by a model, which simulates a linear acoustic network in the time domain. Using surrogate data instead of actual LES data, exhibits two considerable advantages for the investigations conducted in PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE. First, the generation of time series data is computationally very efﬁcient and affordable. This allows to cover a wide range of varying time series properties (such as SNR or time series length) and to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. Second, the true plant model and the true noise model are known and can be used as reference models, since they are used to generate the surrogate data in the ﬁrst place. Consequently, the error made by the re-identiﬁed models may be quantiﬁed accurately by comparing the re-identiﬁed models with the true solution. For a detailed discussion of the surrogate data approach and its limitations, the reader is referred to PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE. PAPER -SI FTF focuses on the identiﬁability of the FTF under the aspect of a closed-loop identiﬁca- tion problem. Due to the ﬂame inherent ITA feedback loop explained in Sec. 2.03, the thermoacoustic system is always a closed-loop, yielding a closed-loop identiﬁcation problem. Taking this into consid- eration, PAPER -SI FTF compares the FTF models resulting from a BJ identiﬁcation approach with the ones from a regularized and a standard FIR identiﬁcation procedure. The study demonstrates that a FIR identiﬁcation yields biased estimates for closed-loop systems even in the limit of inﬁnitely long time series. Conversely, the BJ model structure yields superior estimates in case of a closed-loop problem, see Fig. 5.02. Yet, Fig. 5.02 also demonstrates that for short time series length no signiﬁcant improvement is observable for the BJ identiﬁcation approach. In this case the identiﬁcation error originating from using a ﬁnite time series length dominates the bias introduced by the closed-loop identiﬁcation. Note that in PAPER -SI FTF advanced SI techniques are already used but no attention is paid to the iden- tiﬁed noise model itself. Only the improvement of the FTF estimation is studied when taking into account a colored noise contribution. Conversely, PAPER -SI N OISE focuses on the identiﬁcation accuracy of the noise model. Similarly to the outcome of P APER -SI FTF it is demonstrated that the BJ identiﬁcation is superior to simpler model structures when it comes to the noise model identiﬁcation. Due to its gen- System Identiﬁcation in Thermoacoustics 101 102 103 1040 0.01 0.02 0.03 N∆t/τ ϵ Figure 5.02: Identiﬁcation error for the FTF depending on the time series data length. Different model structures are compared: FIR ( ), regularized FIR ( ) and BJ ( ). The BJ identiﬁca- tion yields superior estimates for longer time series (reproduced from PAPER -SI FTF). eral model structure, the BJ model identiﬁcation also yields accurate estimates if the noise source is of simpler structure. This is an important ﬁnding. Whereas for the plant model part the choice of model structure and order is physically motivated (no auto-regression and the model order depends on the con- vective time delay ), the most suitable model structure and order of the noise model is not evident. Therefore, the general BJ model structure is preferable as it introduces no restrictions on the noise model structure. In this context P APER -SI N OISE demonstrates the combined use of Akaike Information Criterion and a model residual analysis to estimate the most suitable model order. A representative result of a model residual analysis is shown in Fig. 5.03. If the identiﬁed model exhibits a signiﬁcant auto-correlation within its residuals, the so-called ‘Test of Whiteness’ is failed. This means that there are predictable dynamics in the noise contribution, which are not yet resolved by the noise model. Accordingly, the noise model order needs to be increased. Similarly, if a signiﬁcant cross-correlation between input and output signal is found, the deterministic part is under-resolved. The ‘Independence Test’ fails. In combination with Akaike Information Criterion, which judges the trade-off between model accuracy and model uncertainty, the residual analysis provides a purely data-driven indication of the most suitable model order. −30 −20 −10 0 10 20 30 −0.02 0.02 Lag γϵϵ −0.02 0.02 γϵu Figure 5.03: Residual analysis of an identiﬁed model that passes successfully the Test of Whiteness (bot- tom) and the Independence Test (top) (reproduced from PAPER -SI N OISE ). 5.05 Application on Noise Dyn LES data In summary, PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE suggest that a BJ model structure is the most suitable one to apply for the simultaneously identiﬁcation of ﬂame response and combustion noise model of a turbulent ﬂame. 5.05 Application on Noise Dyn LES data After PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE investigated the BJ model identiﬁcation on the basis of surrogate data, it is applied now on actual broadband LES data of the Noise Dyn case, which are shown in Fig. 4.03. By choosing a BJ model order of nb = 30, nc = 6, nd = 6 and nf = 1, a plant model, i.e. an FTF, and a noise model are identiﬁed from the same broadband time series data. Figure 5.04 shows the identiﬁed plant model part G as well as the experimentally measured FTF, which was determined via subsequent mono-frequent excitation at different frequencies. The gain of the iden- tiﬁed FTF is in satisfactory agreement with the measured FTF. Phase values are in excellent agreement. 0.05 1.05 |G| 0 100 200 300 400 500 −3π −2π −π π f [Hz] ∠G Figure 5.04: Measured FTF ( ) with corresponding error bars (I) compared with the FTF ( ) obtained from the LES/SI approach via BJ identiﬁcation (Reproduced from PAPER -ROM). Figure 5.05 depicts the identiﬁed noise model H. The amplitude of H has to be interpreted as normal- ized heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ s, meaning that at 200 Hz the noise source amplitude amounts to approximately 13 % of the mean heat release rate. In accordance with Strouhal number based noise models the noise source amplitude increases towards a peak frequency and rolls off to higher frequencies. Generally, the BJ identiﬁcation could be applied to any signal including experimentally generated broad- band time series data. The excitation with a broadband signal, however, is not available in the test-rig facility - a one-to-one validation of the identiﬁed model, as it is shown for the FTF, is not possible. Nonetheless, to validate the identiﬁed noise model to some extent, it is compared with the spectral dis- tribution of heat release rate ﬂuctuation extracted from an unforced LES with non-reﬂective boundary conditions. Although non-reﬂective boundary conditions are applied, it is emphasized that the spectrum System Identiﬁcation in Thermoacoustics 0 200 400 600 800 1,0000 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 f [Hz] |H| Figure 5.05: Noise model from LES/SI approach via BJ identiﬁcation ( ) compared with spectral dis- tribution of heat release rate from an unforced LES with non-reﬂective boundary conditions ( ). extracted from LES cannot be considered as a pure source term ˙Q′ s. Instead, it comprises additionally feedback effects from the two-way coupling between ﬂame and acoustics, see explanations given in Sec. 2.03. Since the two-way coupling is inherently resolved within the compressible LES, a separation is not readily possible between the source contribution and the contribution from coupling effects. Neverthe- less, Fig. 5.05 shows that the spectrum of heat release rate ﬂuctuations extracted from LES is in good agreement with the identiﬁed noise model H. This does not necessarily imply that the identiﬁed model is physically correct. If the LES data used for the identiﬁcation would not describe the involved processes physically correct, an erroneous noise model would result. The level of agreement shown by results in Fig. 5.05, however, conﬁrm at least that the identiﬁcation procedure itself does not introduce signiﬁcant deviations. The data-driven identiﬁcation of models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source corresponds to the second step of the modeling strategy introduced in Fig. 1.01. The remaining step is now to incorporate the identiﬁed models into an acoustic low-order model description of the combustor in order to predict the combustor dynamics and the sound pressure level within the combustor. 6 Reduced Order Model Based Predictions One possibility to study the thermoacoustic behavior of a combustion system is to regard the combustor as an assembly of acoustic elements, wherein each element relates the upstream and downstream acoustic ﬁeld through simple algebraic relations. By connecting the individual elements, a linear acoustic network model can be composed, which provides an acoustic description of the combustor. If additionally a ﬂame model is incorporated into the network model, areduced order modelresults, providing a thermoacoustic description of the combustor. Via a linear acoustic network model that contains an FTF model a thermoacoustic stability analysis may be conducted [84–91]. This yields frequencies, growth rates and mode shapes of the combustor eigen- modes. Taking additionally a model for the combustion noise source into account, the network model allows also to predict the sound pressure distribution reached at a given location within the combustor, given that the model used is thermoacoustically stable. Quantitative sound pressure estimations for cases that undergo a thermoacoustic instability require a model formulation that takes non-linear ﬂame behavior into account. Regarding the validity range of a network model and the interpretation of its results, the reader ﬁnds a detailed discussion in PAPER -2 WAY. The capabilities, namely the simple formulation and the straightforward incorporation of the identiﬁed models from LES/SI, make the acoustic network model approach the natural choice for the ‘reduced order model predictions of combustor dynamics and noise’. This is the third and ﬁnal step of the modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01. Note that for the use of more complex acoustic descriptions, such as e.g. a Helmholtz solver or a solver using linearized ﬂow equations, the incorporation of the identiﬁed models would not imply additional effort. The identical model formulation of plant model and noise model could be used and their coupling into the acoustic solver would be realized similarly to the network model approach. Yet, due to its ﬂexibility and computational efﬁciency, a linear acoustic network model has the potential to predict the combustor dynamics and the sound pressure spectra within a combustor conﬁguration across a large range of parameters. In addition, the model provides valuable insight into the interplay between ﬂame dynamics, noise source and cavity acoustics within a conﬁned combustor. In the present thesis a reduced order model approach is used in P APER -SM to reproduce the non- reactive and the reactive combustor scattering matrix of the Noise Dyn conﬁguration. In P APER -2 WAY and PAPER -ROM the spectral sound pressure distributions within two different turbulent combustor test- rigs are predicted via a reduced order model. The structure of this chapter is the following: Sec. 6.01 introduces the transfer and scattering matrix nota- tions. These notations are essential for the formulation of the linear network model itself and are needed for a correct interpretation of the results shown in PAPER -SM. After Sec. 6.02 explains the network model used for the Noise Dyn test-rig, the sections 6.03 and 6.04 refer to the reduced model order predictions of combustor dynamics and sound pressure spectra, respectively. Reduced Order Model Based Predictions 6.01 Transfer and scattering matrix notation Transfer matrix and scattering matrix are interchangeable notations for describing the acoustic relations across a single or an assembly of acoustic elements. The transfer matrix relates the acoustic ﬁeld upstream and downstream of an element either in terms of the primitive acoustic variables u′ and p′ [p′ d ¯ρ ¯c u′ d ] = [T 11 T 12 T 21 T 22 ][p′ u ¯ρ ¯c u′ u ] (6.01) or in terms of the characteristic waves f and g [fd gd ] = [ T f g 11 T f g T f g 21 T f g ][fu gu ] (6.02) The scattering matrix, in turn, relates the outgoing characteristic waves fd and gu to their incoming counterparts fu and gd [fd gu ] = [S 11 S 12 S 21 S 22 ][ fu gd ] = [Tud Rdd Ruu Tdu ][ fu gd ] (6.03) All three notations can be converted into one another by simple algebraic transformations. Each notation, however, exhibits certain advantages. On the one hand, the transfer matrix notation often allows a ﬂuid dynamical interpretation of its individual coefﬁcients. If a reactive combustor is described by a transfer matrix, the thermoacoustic interaction is mainly characterized by its T 22 coefﬁcient. On the other hand, the scattering matrix notation makes possible a clear distinction between input and output signals. The characteristic waves fu and gd are considered as inputs signals, whereas fd and gu can be seen as the response of the system to the given input signals. Hence, the scattering matrix respects causality as it represents a causal relation between ingoing and outgoing signals. Accordingly, the coefﬁcients S 11 and S 22 may be interpreted as transmission coefﬁcients, whereas the coefﬁcients S 12 and S 21 describe the reﬂection of ingoing characteristic waves, see Eq. (6.03). From an LES/SI perspective the scattering matrix is suited better for identiﬁcation. The respected causal- ity of the scattering matrix notation implies that the current output signals depend only on prior inputs and outputs. For the identiﬁcation a causal FIR model may be used, which convolutes the model coef- ﬁcients with prior inputs only. This would not hold for a non-causal system such as the transfer matrix notation. For the transfer matrix a clear separation between input and response is not possible and the current output signal depends therefore on future inputs and outputs. Thus, non-causal SI techniques are necessary for the direct identiﬁcation of the transfer matrix coefﬁcients. 6.02 Reduced order model of Noise Dyn combustor In this section the reduced order model of the Noise Dyn combustor is explained as it is used in the publications PAPER -SM and PAPER -ROM. Figure 6.01 shows a sketch of the model. In accordance with the experimental test-rig shown in Fig. 3.01 it can be divided into four main components: plenum, swirler + injection tube, combustion chamber and exhaust. The network model is implemented in the open-source acoustic network tool ta X. Therein, network elements are characterized by transfer matrices that are formulated in terms of characteristic waves, see Eq. (6.02). This notation has the advantage that an assembly of multiple elements can be realized by simple concatenation of the individual elements, represented mathematically by a multiplication of the 6.02 Reduced order model of Noise Dyn combustor ˙Q′ s ˙Q′ cu′ ref freq. freq.

Duct sections are modeled loss free and introduce only a time lag between ingoing and outgoing acoustic wave [fd gd ] = [e−iωl/ ¯c 0 0 eiωl/ ¯c ][ fu gu ] (6.04) with ω, l and ¯c denoting the angular frequency, the duct length and the mean speed of sound, respectively. To avoid uncertain modeling parameters, the formulation for an area jump does not include any loss coefﬁcients or end corrections. It reads simply as [fd gd ] = [1 + Au/Ad 1 − Au/Ad 1 − Au/Ad 1 + Au/Ad ][ fu gu ] (6.05) where Au/Ad describes the area ratio from upstream to downstream. The complex radial swirler ge- ometry shown in Fig. 3.02 and indicated by the cross in Fig. 6.01 is described only insufﬁciently by duct sections and area jumps. Therefore, its acoustic transfer behavior is determined separately via LES/SI. The according procedure is as follows: The ﬂow in an LES domain, which comprises only the radial swirler geometry, is excited sequentially from upstream and downstream with an acoustic broadband signal. From the upstream forced data set the characteristic waves fd and gu are used as output signals for the identiﬁcation of the coefﬁcients S 11 and S 21. The remaining two coefﬁcients of the scattering matrix are estimated analogously from the downstream forced data set. As an additional cross-validation of the obtained swirler scattering matrix, the scattering matrix was also determined via a multiple-input multiple-output identiﬁcation: a broadband excitation was applied simultaneously upstream and down- stream and all 4 scattering matrix coefﬁcients were identiﬁed from the resulting time series data set. The scattering matrices for both approaches were in excellent agreement. For the swirler scattering matrix identiﬁcation a standard FIR model structure is applied since no feedback or colored noise contribution is expected in this non-reactive LES computation. Figure 6.02 shows the identiﬁed scattering matrix. The swirler is not completely transparent for acous- tic waves, but instead exhibits increasing acoustic reﬂection with increasing frequencies. Experimental data for the validation of the swirler scattering matrix are not available, however, the correctness of the identiﬁed swirler scattering matrix is corroborated by two different studies. First, PAPER -SM shows that the identiﬁed swirler scattering matrix improves the accuracy of the network model compared with a simpliﬁed modeling of the swirler. Second, the identiﬁed swirler scattering matrix is cross-validated in against results obtained from linearized compressible ﬂow equations. Therein, very good agreement is found.

At the downstream end of the network model shown in Fig. 6.01 the acoustic reﬂection is described by [fd gd ] = [ 0 0 −Rd(ω) 1 ][ fu gu ] (6.06) Depending on the outlet condition studied, open-ended or equipped with a perforated plate, the reﬂection coefﬁcient Rd(ω) is adapted. At the upstream end the combustor is assumed to be fully reﬂecting, yielding a constant reﬂection coefﬁcient equal to unity. By using the analytical formulations above, the passive acoustics are fully described within the com- bustor. A validation of the passive acoustics is included in P APER -SM and P APER -ROM. P APER -SM compares successfully the measured and the predicted scattering matrix for the non-reactive combustor. This validates the transmission and reﬂection of acoustic waves within the network model. PAPER -ROM proves that the eigenfrequencies found in experiment for the non-reactive conﬁguration are in accor- dance with the predicted ones from the network model, which validates additionally the acoustic cavity description of the network model. For describing the reactive or active setup, the effect of the ﬂame is taken into account in the linear network model via the heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′, see Fig. 6.01. Thereby, the ﬂame modeling strategy of two separate contributions ˙Q′ s and ˙Q′ c corresponds exactly to the modeling strategy described in Fig. 2.03 and to the model structure chosen in the identiﬁcation procedure, see Fig. 5.01. Hence, for the plant model G(ω) and the noise model H(ω) the models identiﬁed in Sec. 5.05 are used directly. 6.02 Reduced order model of Noise Dyn combustor The remaining step is to establish a link between the total heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ sum and the thereof generated acoustic variables f and g. Fig. 2.03 denotes this step as ‘acoustic conversion’of heat release rate ﬂuctuations into acoustic waves. The conversion is realized through the linearized Rankine- Hugoniot equations, which describe the jump conditions across a thin reaction zone in the limit of low Mach numbers. Formulated in terms of primitive variables the Rankine-Hugoniot equations read as: [ p′ d ( ¯ρ ¯c) d u′ d ] = [ξ 0 0 1 ][ p′ u ( ¯ρ ¯c) u u′ u ] + [ 0 Θ ¯uu ] ˙Q′ sum (6.07) herein, the indices ‘u’ and ‘d’ specify quantities upstream and downstream of the ﬂame, respectively, ξ = ( ¯ρ ¯c)u)/( ¯ρ ¯c)d ) describes the speciﬁc acoustic impedance andΘ = Td /Tu −1 denotes the temperature jump across the ﬂame. Equation (6.07) states that the acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations across the compact reaction zone, i.e. the ﬂame, remain constant and only the acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations are modulated across the ﬂame. Using the deﬁnitions of f and g, see Eq. (2.04), one may reformulate Eq. (6.07) as [fd gd ] = 1 [ξ+1 ξ−1 Θ ¯uu ξ−1 ξ+1 −Θ ¯uu ]  fu gu ˙Q′ sum   (6.08) Recalling Eq. (5.01) from the general SI model approach and assuming that ˙Q′ sum = ˙Q′ c + ˙Q′ s, one ﬁnds [fd gd ] = 1 [ξ+1 ξ−1 ξ−1 ξ+1 ][ fu gu ] +Θ ¯uu ( G(ω)u′ ref +H(ω)e )[ 1 −1 ] (6.09) herein, u′ ref is already normalized with the mean reference velocity ¯uref, which can be related to ¯uu via the area ratio between reference position and upstream ﬂame position ¯uref = ¯uu Au Aref (6.010) With Eq. (6.09) this yields [fd gd ] = 1 [ξ+1 ξ−1 ξ−1 ξ+1 ][ fu gu ]    passive ﬂame + 1 Aref Au ΘG(ω) [ 1 −1 −1 1 ][ fref gref ]    active ﬂame + 1 Aref Au ¯ure fΘH(ω) e [ 1 −1 ]    noise source (6.011) The three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 6.011 should be interpreted as follows. The ﬁrst term speciﬁes scattering of acoustic waves by the change in impedance across the passive ﬂame (steady heat release), i.e. the temperature discontinuity. The second term describes theactive ﬂame part (unsteady heat release) as the ﬂame response resulting from acoustic perturbations at the reference position. The third term deﬁnes the contribution of the stochastic noise source. Equation (6.011), however, is only valid and applicable if certain constraints are respected: 1) The reaction zone has to be compact with respect to the smallest wavelength considered. 2) The inﬂuence of pressure ﬂuctuations on the ﬂame must be negligible such that the ﬂame reacts predominantly to upstream ve- locity perturbations. 3) Heat loss across the boundaries has to be negligible in the reaction zone. In the Reduced Order Model Based Predictions Noise Dyn conﬁguration all three constraints are respected. Acoustic compactness is usually assumed if the Helmholtz number is small, i.e. He ≪ 1. For the working conditions explained in Sec. 3.02 the char- acteristic ﬂame length amounts to about lf ≈ 0.004 m. In PAPER -ROM the network model is evaluated up to a maximum frequency of 1000 Hz. With the given ﬂame length this corresponds to a Helmholtz num- ber of He < 0.01. Next, the ﬂame studied is perfectly premixed. For perfectly premixed ﬂames velocity sensitivity is a valid assumption. Regarding the heat loss across the reaction zone, the combustion chamber walls are made out of quartz glass walls without any active cooling applied. Accordingly, no signiﬁcant heat loss is expected across the boundaries in the compact reaction zone. The ﬁnally resulting reduced order model is a linear model, which is capable of predicting the linear stability limits and the sound pressure distribution for thermoacoustically stable conﬁgurations. Yet, the validity range of the reduced order model is restricted to the linear regime. An FTF is used in the model formulation that provides only a valid ﬂame description in the limit of small perturbations and thus for linear ﬂame behavior. This allows indeed to predict frequency and instability margin of linearly unstable eigenmodes (see PAPER -2 WAY), but the estimation of the saturation amplitude for a limit cycle oscillation is not possible. The ﬂame response saturation for increasing perturbation amplitudes and consequently the limit cycle amplitude is governed by non-linear effects, which are not accounted for in the FTF. A non-linear ﬂame description would be necessary in this case for predictions of the oscillation amplitude. 6.03 Prediction of combustor dynamics The combustor scattering matrix is a valuable tool for characterizing the combustor dynamics as it allows to set up an acoustic energy balance, which in turns determines the ampliﬁcation or damping across the scattering object. In addition, possible feedback mechanisms may be revealed by an analysis of the combustor scattering matrix. In PAPER -SM the scattering matrix from upstream of the swirler to downstream of the combustion cham- ber, indicated by the gray box in Fig. 6.01, is determined by three different approaches: 1) experimentally by applying an upstream forcing for two different acoustic loads, 2) numerically by identifying the scat- tering matrix directly via LES/SI from the corresponding input and output signals, 3) by using a reduced order model that contains only the parts within the gray box shown in Fig. 6.01. This means that in the third approach only the identiﬁed FTF, see Fig. 5.04, is taken into account, but not yet the noise source model and the acoustic boundaries. The attractiveness of the third approach is twofold. One the one hand, it offers large ﬂexibility at reduced computational cost. Modiﬁcations in the combustor geometry and their effects on the scattering matrix may easily be studied by adapting and re-evaluating the reduced order model in the frequency domain. In experiments or a standalone LES approach, this would imply considerable effort. On the other hand, PAPER -SM shows that the network model provides intuitive physical insight into the chain of mecha- nisms involved by including or excluding individual terms in the analysis. A possibility that is not readily available in experiments or a mere LES approach. One objective of P APER -SM is to investigate up to which extend the reduced order model yields sat- isfactory results for the combustor scattering matrix, compared to the other two approaches. The sim- pliﬁcations made in the network model such as 1-D acoustics, loss-free area contractions, geometry simpliﬁcations or constant mean temperature in the burnt gas region may introduce errors, however, their signiﬁcance is unknown. Note that a one-to-one comparison between the three approaches is still missing in literature for a turbulent combustor scattering matrix. A successful comparison between these methods would validate among other things the Rankine-Hugoniot coupling applied in the reduced order model. 6.04 Prediction of sound pressure distribution Figure 6.03 depicts exemplarily the results for the S 11 coefﬁcient of the combustor scattering matrix. Overall, good agreement is found between the three methods. Consequently, it is reasoned that the com- |S 11| 100 200 300 400 −2π −π f [Hz] ∠S 11 Figure 6.03: Gain and phase of S 11 coefﬁcient of reactive combustor scattering matrix. Experimental val- ues ( ) are in excellent agreement with results obtained from LES/SI ( ) and the reduced order model approach ( ). A strong modulation of the passive ﬂame case ( ) is found in the S 11 coefﬁcient (reproduced from PAPER -SM). bustor dynamics are described satisfyingly by the reduced order model, the errors introduced due to simpliﬁcations made are only of minor signiﬁcance. Only the S 12 coefﬁcient (not shown here) exhibits a noticeable discrepancy. Although the two independent numerical approaches yield agreeing results, a deviation from measured values is observed. For a detailed discussion on this aspect the reader is referred to PAPER -SM. In addition to the active scattering matrix in PAPER -SM the combustor scattering matrix is evaluated for a passive ﬂame, see ( ) in Fig. 6.03. In the passive ﬂame case the temperature jump across the ﬂame is taken into account but not the ﬂame response. Thus, in Eq. 6.011 not only the source term is set to zero, but also the second term on the right-hand side. Note that such a study is possible only with the reduced order model at hand. The comparison between active and passive ﬂame case highlights the inﬂuence of the ﬂame response. It is found that the impact of the active ﬂame manifests itself mainly in the S 11 coefﬁcient of the scattering matrix. In P APER -SM an intuitive explanation of this behavior is given based on the travel path of the acoustic waves. To summarize PAPER -SM, the validation of the reduced order model puts the subsequent prediction of sound pressure spectra on a solid basis. It justiﬁes the use of the Rankine-Hugoniot equations for the ‘acoustic conversion’ from heat release rate ﬂuctuations to acoustic ﬂuctuations, see Fig. 2.03. 6.04 Prediction of sound pressure distribution The last section in this chapter deals with the prediction of the sound pressure level within a conﬁned combustor. Together with the results of the preceding section this covers the last step of the modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01. For the sound pressure prediction the full model shown in Fig. 6.01 is retained, including the noise model part H and the acoustic boundaries. In case of thermoacoustically stable con- ﬁgurations this allows quantitative estimates of the sound pressure distribution within the combustor. For sound pressure predictions the reduced order model represents an immensely ﬂexible approach. The effect of changes in the boundary impedance or in the conﬁnement geometry that do not have an impact on the ﬂame characteristic may be investigated by simply adapting the respective network model element. Even if the ﬂame characteristics are varied, i.e. the combustor operating point changes, only a Reduced Order Model Based Predictions single additional LES run is necessary to re-identify the FTF and the corresponding noise model. By using a reduced order model, P APER -2 WAY investigates the implications of one-way coupling and two-way coupling on the resulting sound pressure distribution. Compared to the subsequently discussed investigations in PAPER -ROM, two important aspects need to be clariﬁed. First, the test-rig studied in PAPER -2 WAY is not the Noise Dyn combustor, but instead a turbulent swirl combustor located at the Technische Universität München. Thus, a different network model as well as different models for the FTF and the noise source are used. Second, in PAPER -2 WAY a standard FIR identiﬁcation is applied for the estimation of the FTF. As the FIR model structure does not include any estimation of the noise contribution during the identiﬁcation step, see Eq. (5.04), a rough estimation of the noise contribution is achieved by an additional post-processing step, which is preformed after the FTF identiﬁcation. PAPER - SI N OISE demonstrates, however, that this procedure yields inferior estimates of the noise contribution since any bias in the FTF model propagates directly into the noise source estimation. Yet, PAPER -2 WAY focuses mainly on the implications of ITA feedback on the sound pressure distribution within the com- bustor. Therefore, a simpliﬁed estimation of the noise source is enough to meet the requirements for that study. Incorporation of the FTF into the linear network model resolves inherently the two-way coupling be- tween ﬂame and acoustic ﬁeld. Other than in experiments or a mere LES approach, the network model allows also to retain a one-way coupling situation by neglecting the response of the ﬂame to upstream velocity perturbations, i.e. by neglecting the FTF. Consequently, the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.011) vanishes. A setup as shown schematically in Fig. 2.01 results. An isolated acoustic source is placed in a resonant cavity. PAPER -2 WAY demonstrates that the sound pressure distribution in a con- ﬁned combustor is only predicted correctly if the prediction method accounts for the two-way coupling between ﬂame and acoustic ﬁeld within the combustor. Placing solely a noise source in a resonant cavity yields reasonable results, but it may not be enough to capture the full characteristics of the resulting spectral sound pressure distribution. Hence, for reduced order model based predictions of sound pressure the consideration of the ﬂame response is mandatory - an aspect not always recognized. In PAPER -ROM it is the ﬁrst time that the BJ identiﬁcation is applied on actual LES time series data of a turbulent swirl combustor. The FTF and the noise model shown in Fig. 5.04 and Fig. (5.05) are identiﬁed simultaneously from the same broadband LES time series. By using the identiﬁed models consequently in the reduced order model shown in Fig. 6.01, sound pressure spectra in the Noise Dyn combustor are predicted for two different outlet boundary conditions. Results are compared with measurements at the microphone location MC. Note that a proper and extensive comparison to experimental results is only possible because the ﬂame dynamics (i.e. the FTF), the spectral distribution of sound pressure and the acoustic boundary conditions are quantiﬁed accurately in experiments. Figure 6.04 exhibits an excellent quantitative agreement between measured and predicted values of the sound pressure for the open-ended combustor conﬁguration. An evaluation of the combustor eigenmodes via the network model shows that the moderate peak observable in Fig. 6.04 results from a resonant 3/4 λ mode, which is predominantly active in the combustion chamber. In P APER -ROM pressure spectra for the conﬁguration equipped with the perforated plate are also compared successfully (not shown here). The result for the conﬁguration with perforated plate is therein achieved by a simple re-evaluation of the linear network model with the same FTF and the same noise model. Only Rd is adapted according to the measured values of the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the perforated plate. So having a validated network model at hand, the inﬂuence on the resulting sound pressure spectrum of modiﬁcations in combustor geometry or reﬂection conditions may be studied across a large range of parameters at reasonable computational costs. This would allow to optimize the combustor in terms of sound pressure levels reached already in the design stage of a device. 6.04 Prediction of sound pressure distribution 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 f [Hz] SPL [d B] Figure 6.04: Measured sound pressure distribution ( ) and corresponding reduced order model predic- tion ( ) for the open-ended Noise Dyn combustor (reproduced from PAPER -ROM). Reduced Order Model Based Predictions 7 Summary and Discussion of Papers This chapter serves as a summary to highlight compactly the interconnection between the major publica- tions discussed in the current thesis. Figure 7.01 is an extension of the initially depicted modeling strategy shown in Fig. 1.01. It illustrates how each individual publication contributes to the overall framework developed. In PAPER -LES the capability of the compressible LES setup is ascertained to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively measured sound pressure distributions for stable as well as unstable working conditions. From today’s standpoint this has not yet been achieved with the same level of quantitative agreement and may therefore be considered as a novelty. Conversely, the overall good agreement corroborates that the ﬂame dynamics as well as the generation of combustion noise are well described within the LES. This is a prerequisite for the subsequent application of SI techniques. If the SI routines are fed with erroneous input-output data from LES, incorrect data-driven models would result. Consequently, the validated LES setup from PAPER -LES is used for the generation of input-output time series data, which constitutes the ﬁrst step in Fig. 7.01. This step builds the basis for the simultaneous identiﬁcation of ﬂame dynamics and combustion noise source for the Noise Dyn combustor via the LES/SI approach. Based on surrogate data P APER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE evaluate and investigate in detail ad- vanced SI techniques. These studies provide a theoretical framework and represent an exploratory study before the application of advanced SI techniques on actual LES data. Therein, the BJ model investigated may be seen as an extension of the established FIR identiﬁcation, which does not provide any estima- tion of a combustion noise model. The BJ model yields not only unbiased estimates of the FTF under closed-loop conditions, but also allows from one set of time series data the simultaneous identiﬁcation of models for the ﬂame dynamic response and the combustion noise source. This extends considerably the scope of applications of the established LES/SI approach. The exploratory studies in PAPER -SI FTF and PAPER -SI N OISE provide a detailed understanding of the advanced SI methods used and demonstrate that the BJ model structure is superior compared with simpler model structures. It is thus deemed to be the most suitable model structure to be applied on input-output time series, which are generated in the preceding step via compressible LES. Data-driven models for the ﬂame response and the noise source result that are associated with the second step shown in Fig. 7.01. The identiﬁed models of ﬂame response and noise source are consequently incorporated into a linear acoustic network model. A reduced order model is obtained that allows the prediction of combustor dynamics and noise. In a ﬁrst step, P APER -SM couples only the ﬂame response model into the linear acoustic network model of the Noise Dyn combustor. Thereof, the scattering matrix of the combustor is deduced for non-reactive and reactive conditions. The successful one-to-one comparison of the predicted combustor dynamics against the results from LES/SI and experiment proves the applicability of the Rankine-Hugoniot equations and validates the acoustic network model description. Accordingly, PAPER - SM may be seen as an intermediate step before coupling additionally the combustion noise source into the acoustic network model via the Rankine-Hugoniot equations, as it is done in P APER -2 WAY and PAPER -ROM Therein, reduced order predictions are made for the sound pressure distribution within conﬁned combus- tors. PAPER -2 WAY investigates the effect of two-way coupling and in particular of ITA feedback on the Summary and Discussion of Papers resulting sound pressure spectrum. The comparison of the computed spectra against measurement data demonstrates that the sound pressure spectrum is correctly reproduced only if the full two-way coupling approach is retained, i.e. not only the noise model but also the FTF is coupled into the linear acoustic net- work model. In PAPER -ROM the BJ identiﬁcation is applied for the ﬁrst time to actual LES data in order to identify simultaneously the FTF and a noise model. Spectral sound pressure distributions are predicted for two different combustor cavities and satisfactory agreement with experimental data is found for both conﬁgurations. A validation with measurement data is merely possible since an accurate and complete experimental characterization of the test-rig is available in terms of ﬂame response, pressure spectra and acoustic boundary reﬂections. PAPER -SM, PAPER -2 WAY and PAPER -ROM synthesize the ﬁndings and outcome of the preceding three publications to predict the combustor dynamics and noise via a reduced order model. This covers the last step shown in Fig. 7.01. By having a validated reduced order model at hand, an intuitive physical interpretation of the resulting sound spectra is possible. Moreover, the sound pressure spectra for a variety of combustor conﬁgurations would be possible to predict with reasonable computational effort. In turn, this allows the optimization of the combustor geometry in terms of reducing the combustion noise level already in the design phase of a device. In summary, the present thesis covers the whole procedure explained in Fig. 7.01: from broadband data generation via compressible LES over to the concurrent identiﬁcation of models for ﬂame response and noise source to the point of combining the identiﬁed models with a linear network model. Thus, a closed framework is developed, presented and validated in the current thesis that allows to determine combustion noise and combustion dynamics of a conﬁned turbulent combustor. The main outcome of the present work was published in several papers. In the following sections only the publications that contributed essentially to the present thesis are summarized with respect to their main ﬁndings and their relevance for the thesis.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.01 Measurement and Simulation of Combustion Noise and Dynamics of a Conﬁned Swirl Flame Label: PAPER -LES Outcome: The compressible LES of turbulent reactive ﬂow is capable of reproducing qualitatively and quantitatively the sound pressure distribution within a conﬁned turbulent swirl combustor. The excellent agreement of sound pressure spectra from LES and experiment, for both stable and unstable working conditions, was not achieved previously and may be considered as a novelty. The agreeing results prove that not only the generation of combustion noise, but also the ﬂame response and the two-way interaction between ﬂame and acoustics are accurately described within the LES. Relevance for the thesis: In this publication the basis is provided for the following publications. An accurate LES description of ﬂame response and noise generation is prerequisite for the generation of broadband time series data via LES used for the subsequent identiﬁcation of FTF and noise model.

The conducted surrogate data study shows that in this case the widely used FIR model yields biased estimates for the FTF, even in the limit of inﬁnitely long time series data. This bias can be avoided by using advanced SI techniques such as the BJ model identiﬁcation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that non-reﬂective boundary conditions are not essentially necessary for an accurate identiﬁcation of the FTF, which extends the applicability of the LES/SI approach. Relevance for the thesis: The BJ identiﬁcation is introduced into the thermoacoustic framework and its potential of identifying an unbiased FTF under closed-loop conditions is highlighted. This publication, however, focuses only on the identiﬁcation of the FTF. The added value of identifying additionally a noise model from the same time series data is not yet discussed in detail.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.03 Simultaneous Identiﬁcation of Transfer Functions and Combustion Noise of a Turbulent Flame Label: PAPER -SI N OISE Outcome: Advanced SI methods are used for the simultaneous identiﬁcation of an FTF and a combus- tion noise model. Based on surrogate data the performance of SI methods in regard to the noise model identiﬁcation is tested systematically for different time series properties. It is demonstrated that the BJ model structure is superior to the widely used FIR model as it allows an accurate and unbiased identiﬁca- tion of the combustion noise source, even if the reference noise model is of simpler structure. Moreover, it is shown how the combined use of Akaike Information Criterion and a model residual analysis allows an estimation of the most suitable model order of FTF and noise model. The additional identiﬁcation of a noise source model extends considerably the scope of applications of the LES/SI approach in the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics. Relevance for the thesis: This work exploits the capability of advanced SI methods to identify not only the FTF but also a model for the combustion noise source from the same time series data. As limited experience is available for the noise model identiﬁcation, methods are investigated that provide data- driven estimates of the most suitable model order. Together with P APER -SI FTF this work builds a solid theoretical basis for the application of advanced SI techniques on actual broadband LES data of a turbulent combustor.

As long as the constraints of the Rankine- Hugoniot jump equations are respected, the scattering matrix may also be derived from a ﬂexible and computationally more efﬁcient reduced order model, which is composed from a coupling between FTF and passive acoustic network model. Relevance for the thesis: The satisfying agreement between the composed approach and the direct LES/SI approach validates the acoustic network model and the use of the Rankine-Hugoniot jump equa- tions in the current setup. In turn, this is of importance for the publications P APER -2 WAY and PAPER - ROM. Therein, the combustion noise model used is formulated in terms of stochastic heat release rate ﬂuctuations, which are coupled into the linear network model via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump equations.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 7.05 The contribution of intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback to combustion noise and resonances of a conﬁned turbulent premixed ﬂame Label: PAPER -2 WAY Outcome: The sound pressure distribution in a conﬁned turbulent combustor is predicted via a linear acoustic network model that includes a combustion noise model. Overall good agreement to experimen- tal measurements is achieved. Peaks in the sound pressure spectrum are found that are not related to any acoustic cavity modes. A thorough network model analysis shows that these peaks can only be repro- duced if the full two-way coupling between ﬂame and acoustics is taken into account in the network model formulation. This is ensured by incorporating not only a noise source into the linear network model but also the FTF. Consequently, this publication highlights the importance of retaining the full two-way coupling for sound pressure predictions. Relevance for the thesis: The need of retaining the full two-way coupling requires models for both the combustion noise source as well as for the ﬂame response, i.e. the FTF. With regard to the SI procedure this outcome stresses the necessity of an identiﬁcation procedure that provides both of these models. As shown in PAPER -SI FTF and P APER -SI N OISE, the BJ model identiﬁcation is capable of providing these models. Note that in PAPER -2 WAY the FTF is estimated via an FIR and the noise model is only a simplistic estimation that stems from an additional post-processing step. Contribution: C. Silva and W.

Thereby, not only the FTF but also a combustion noise source model is identiﬁed from a single LES time series. By incorporating both models into a linear acoustic network model via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump equations, the sound pressure spectrum of a conﬁned turbulent swirl combustor is predicted. Excellent agreement to experimental sound pressure spectra is found for two different combustor conﬁgurations. Thereby, the use of the linear acoustic network model allows an intuitive physical interpretation of the resulting sound pressure spectra in terms of resonating cavity acoustics and ﬂame-acoustic interaction. Relevance for the thesis:In this work the outcome and ﬁndings of the preceding studies are synthesized. The LES setup of PAPER -LES is used for generating a broadband time series. By using the BJ identiﬁ- cation technique, which is investigated on the basis of surrogate data in P APER -SI FTF and P APER -SI NOISE, an FTF and a combustion noise model are identiﬁed from the same broadband time series. These models are incorporated into a linear network model via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump equations, whose validity for the setup used is demonstrated in PAPER -SM.

Summary and Discussion of Papers 8 Conclusion and Outlook In this ﬁnal chapter a few concluding remarks on the thesis are given followed by an outlook on a potential continuative research project. 8.01 Conclusion The overall motivation of the current work was to gain a better and deeper understanding of the thermoa- coustic processes responsible for the combustion generated sound in a conﬁned turbulent swirl combus- tor. The thereof resulting objective was then to formulate a reduced order model that allows the prediction of combustor dynamics and combustion noise in a conﬁned setup. Key elements for this purpose are ac- curate models for the generation of combustion noise and for the ﬂame dynamics, i.e. the ﬂame response to acoustic perturbations. To deduce these models a compressible LES was combined with advanced SI techniques, which can be seen as an extension of the established and widely used LES/SI approach [9, 47, 68–78]. The identiﬁed models were consequently incorporated into a linear acoustic network model yielding a closed reduced order formulation, which allowed predictions on the combustor dynam- ics and the noise level within a conﬁned combustor setup. Results of the reduced order model and its individual parts were compared extensively with experimental measurement data. By means of the obtained reduced order model it is demonstrated that the sound pressure spectrum within a conﬁned combustor conﬁguration is shaped by the spectral distribution of the noise source and resonances. Thereby, the resonance might arise either from acoustic eigenmodes of the conﬁning cavity or from an excitation of the intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback loop [30–32]. To capture the latter resonance effect, it is proven that the consideration of the ﬂame dynamic response in the reduced order model is a prerequisite to recover the two-way coupling between ﬂame and acoustic ﬁeld. Indeed, one may ﬁnd in literature more thorough analysis of the ﬂame dynamics of swirling ﬂames, but with a fairly rough treatment of the acoustics at the system boundaries and more often without any analysis of the sound pressure spectrum within the conﬁned system. Conversely, one may also ﬁnd a detailed analysis of the combustion noise source and the acoustic ﬁeld within the system, but with only limited comparisons of the associated ﬂow and ﬂame dynamics. Therefore, it is believed that the current work is among the ﬁrst, where all of these aspects were taken into account with the same concern of analysis. 8.02 Outlook The current thesis investigates only perfectly premixed ﬂames. Consequently, two mechanisms of com- bustion noise generation may be neglected. First, no contribution from upstream equivalence ratio ﬂuc- tuations to the generation of direct combustion noise has to be expected. Second, indirect combustion noise does not play any role in the studied setups since perfectly premixed ﬂames do not generate any entropy ﬂuctuations across ﬂame. This does not hold for technically premixed ﬂames, where equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations upstream of the ﬂame cause both a contribution to the direct noise Conclusion and Outlook generation as well as entropy ﬂuctuations in the downstream burnt gas region. Even though it is unclear how strong the contribution of equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations is on the generation of direct com- bustion noise, it is recognized that the generation of indirect combustion noise through the acceleration of entropy inhomogeneities at the outlet may be signiﬁcant. A potential continuation research project may aim for an extension of the herein developed methods for technically premixed ﬂames to include additionally the effect of upstream equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations. Whereas the additional contribution to the generation of direct combustion noise through upstream equiv- alence ratio ﬂuctuations would be inherently resolved within a compressible LES, the consideration of indirect combustion requires further work. In the CBSBC formulation used in PAPER -LES, the out- going entropy waves (L 2 in LODI formulation ) are already extracted from the LES. Hence, these entropy waves may be considered as an additional input of the state-space boundary model. By adding a relation in the state-space model that provides a link between ingoing entropy waves and generated acoustic waves across a chocked outlet, the output of the boundary state-space model could be refor- mulated as a superposition of the reﬂected acoustic wave and the acoustic wave originating from indirect combustion noise. Similarly to the study in P APER -LES, this would allow a direct assessment of the resulting sound pressure spectrum of a technically premixed combustor. Compared for example to the works, the contribution of indirect noise could be taken into account without resolving in LES the computationally demanding chocked outﬂow. After having assured that the LES correctly describes the generation of direct combustion noise and entropy waves, the LES setup could be used again for the generation of input-output time series data. From the resulting broadband data set a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transfer function could be identiﬁed. Upstream velocity ﬂuctuations u′ ref and upstream equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations φ′ would serve as inputs, whereas the outputs of the MIMO transfer function would be described by the global heat release rate ﬂuctuations ˙Q′ and the entropy ﬂuctuations s′. Challenges in this step would be probably the accurate extraction of entropy ﬂuctuations from the LES and the development of a SI procedure, which is suitable for the MIMO identiﬁcation. If the input signals are correlated this might impede the model estimation. Yet, another project within the Thermo-Fluid Dynamics group of Technische Universität München deals with the Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) transfer function identiﬁcation of technically premixed ﬂames ( u′ ref,φ′ → ˙Q′). The insight gained in this project could be used for the additional identiﬁcation of the missing ‘entropy transfer function’ (φ′ → s′). The assessment of a entropy transfer function for a laminar ﬂame via SI was already studied in. Results for the identiﬁed entropy transfer function could be compared additionally with the analytical formulation derived in. In a last step the network model approach could be extended to take also the convective transport of φ′ and s′ into account. Corresponding formulations are proposed for example in [119–121]. Together with the previously identiﬁed MIMO transfer function system a reduced order model would be obtained, which is valid for technically premixed ﬂames. Based on this model a stability analysis and a sound pressure prediction would be possible, which also take the additional feedback of indirect combustion noise into account. Bibliography T.

Moreover, the present author contributed additionally as a second author to three peer-reviewed publica- tions, which are brieﬂy summarized in the following. In two hybrid non-linear time-domain models are proposed and compared for predicting self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations of laminar premixed ﬂames. The ﬁrst model uses a low Mach number simu- lation that is coupled to a linear acoustic network model via ﬂuctuations of reference velocity and global heat release rate. The second model is based on a fully compressible simulation, which is coupled to CBSBC in order to model the acoustics in the unresolved upstream plenum part. Both models yield complex non-linear oscillations, which are in good agreement. Therefore, it is concluded that the non- linearities that occur during thermoacoustic oscillations may be attributed only to hydrodynamic effects and ﬂame dynamics. The acoustics remain linear. The present author was responsible for the generation of results for the compressible approach. In the swirler scattering matrix shown in Fig. 6.02 is reproduced by linearized ﬂow equations. It is shown that the linearized Navier-Stokes equations describe accurately the scattering of acoustic waves across the swirler. The swirler scattering matrix deduced from LES serves as a benchmark in this study. The present author provided the mean ﬁelds for the linearized ﬂow equations and the benchmark result for the scattering matrix. In the standard Flame Describing Function (FDF) is extended to include not only the fundamen- tal frequency but also higher harmonics. With the extended FDF it is possible to predict precisely the amplitudes and frequencies of the thermoacoustic oscillations computed in, even if the ﬁrst higher harmonic mode dominates the thermoacoustic oscillation. A case in which the standard FDF formulation fails. This publication originated within the scope of the Master Thesis of M. Häringer, which the present author supervised. As these publications have only limited relevance for the topic of the present thesis, they are not repro- duced in the following.

Characteristics-based state-space boundary conditions are coupled to the large-eddy simulation to impose precisely and independently from each other magnitude and phase of the acoustic reflection coefficients at the boundaries of the computational domain. The coupling approach proves to be accurate and flexible in regard to the estimation of sound pressure spectra in a confined swirl combustor for different operating conditions. The predicted sound pressure levels and its spectral distributions are compared to measurements. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement is achieved not only for a stable configuration but also for configurations that exhibit a thermoacoustic instability. This indicates that the flow and flame dynamics are reasonably well reproduced by the simulations.

Introduction C OMBUSTION noise is anundesirable but unavoidable byproduct of turbulent combustion. In many industrial applications such as aeronautical engines or stationary gas turbines, high levels of combustion noise are reached (e.g. for aeronautical engines, combustion noise constitutes a significant contribution to the overall sound emission from a plane at approach and cutback conditions ). Besides harmful effects and annoyance to those being exposed to noise emissions, high levels of combustion noise may lead to structural excitations or even trigger thermoacoustic instabilities. As a consequence, combustion noise is an ongoing research topic. One distinguishes direct from indirect combustion noise. Direct combustion noise is generated by fluctuations of heat release rate in turbulent flow. These heat release rate fluctuations in turn cause unsteady expansion of the gases across the flame brush that generates acoustic pressure fluctuations. The generation of direct combustion noise is hence an inherent mechanism of turbulent flames, which should thus be regarded as a distributed monopole source [3–5]. Indirect combustion noise refers to the generation of acoustic pressure fluctuations due to an acceleration of entropy inhomogeneities in the flowfield (e.g. at a choked outlet of a gas turbine combustor ). The present study only focuses on direct combustion noise and the sound pressure spectra arising thereof. When it comes to the estimation of the spectral sound pressure distribution resulting from a turbulent flame, there are characteristic differences between open and confined configurations. In open configurations, which have been widely studied, the sound pressure spectrum is strongly correlated with the spectrum of the combustion noise source of the flame. Analytical studies suggest that, in the low-frequency region, the magnitude of the combustion noise source spectrum increases toward a peak frequency and then decays in the high-frequency region. Accordingly, the sound pressure distributions of unconfined flames show similar behavior and do not exhibit pronounced peaks. This is confirmed by systematic measurements for unconfined jet flames and slit flames. The sound pressure spectra measured therein are of broadband nature with a peak frequency that scales linearly with the flame length and with the inverse of the injection velocity. Rajaram and Lieuwen formulate in their work a Strouhal number scaling of the peak frequency based on the mean upstream convective velocity and the characteristic flame length, which is defined as“the distance between the axial locations where the transversely integrated intensity of the variance image crosses 25% of the maximum value”. Winkler et al propose the distance between the burner exit plane and the maximum heat release as characteristic flame length. The decrease of magnitude in the combustion noise source spectrum at higher frequencies was derived analytically by Clavin and Siggia. Based on a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum, a decay rate proportional tof−2.05 is predicted.

AIAA JOURNAL V ol. 56, No. 5, May 2018 Downloaded by BIBLIOTHEK DER TU MUENCHEN on June 19, 2018 | http://arc.aiaa.org | DOI: 10.02514/1.J 056502 A.1 P APER -LES, AIAA J. In most engineering applications, however, combustion takes place in a cavity with highly reflecting boundaries. In confined setups, the broadband acoustic pressure fluctuations emitted by the flame may excite the acoustic modes of the combustor. Resonant amplification may lead to distinct tonal peaks in the spectral sound pressure distribution [15–17]. Enhanced coupling between the unsteady heat release of the flame and the acoustic field may even lead to a self-amplifying feedback resulting in the occurrence of a thermoacoustic instability. Therefore, an increasing number of studies was conducted on confined setups recently [15,18–25]. Because unsteadiness due to turbulence needs to be taken into account, large-eddy simulation (LES) appears as the natural tool to model combustion noise from first principles. LES may be used either in an LES/computational aeroacoustics (CAA) approach or in a direct approach. In the LES/CAA approach, the noise source is computed via LES, but propagation and reflection of acoustic of waves within the numerical domain are evaluated by an acoustic solver using an acoustic analogy. Effectively, the noise source is decoupled from the acoustic propagation. For unconfined setups, this methodology is successfully demonstrated by, for example, Flemming et al and Bui et al, whereas Silva et al computed the sound pressure spectrum within a confined swirl combustor by means of a LES/CAA approach. In the compressible LES of the source region, the intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback [28–30] is inherently taken into account, meaning that effects of acoustic waves on the upstream flowfield and thus on the combustion dynamics are captured. This is not the case in an incompressible LES. However, any effects on the source region from outside the source region (i.e. the part resolved from the acoustic solver) are not modeled. Indeed, Silva et al found that their LES/CAA approach fails as soon as the interaction between flame and cavity acoustics is strong. The absence of source coupling also prohibits the use of a LES/CAA approach for describing thermoacoustic instabilities. The two-way coupling between flame dynamics and cavity acoustics, which cannot be captured by an LES/CAA approach, is necessary for the correct prediction of a self- excited instability. For situations in which a significant coupling between flame and acoustics needs to be considered, the direct approach may be preferred. It resolves the combustion noise generation as well as the acoustic propagation within the LES, such that the respective acoustic pressure fluctuations may be extracted directly from the LES. By means of this approach, the mutual influence of flame and acoustics is resolved inherently. Using a direct approach, Silva et al and Kings et al achieved a qualitative agreement with experimental data for the sound pressure spectra in confined swirling flames, wherein only stable working conditions were considered. However, in both studies, the amplitude level in the numerically computed sound pressure spectra are overpredicted compared to acoustic pressure measurements made on the combustion chamber walls. Lourier et al simulated the sound pressure spectrum of a laboratory swirl combustor featuring a thermoacoustic instability. The peak frequency of the sound pressure spectrum is accurately reproduced, but the measured sound pressure level amplitudes are also overpredicted in these simulations. Tran et al showed that the sound pressure field of a confined swirling flame is very sensitive to the reflection coefficient of the premixer, and this may in turn be used to control the fluctuating pressure distribution. The main objective of the current study is to determine the sound pressure spectra of a confined laboratory swirl combustor by means of LES with a direct approach. Because of the newly introduced coupling of the LES to characteristics-based state-space boundary conditions (CBSBCs), the analysis can easily be conducted for stable and unstable working conditions. The sound pressure spectra of one stable, one intermittently unstable, and one fully unstable working condition are investigated. The triggering of the thermoacoustic instability is reproduced only by according changes in the boundary conditions. Simulation results are compared to sound pressure spectra measured at the three operating conditions. The instrumented experimental setup, the operating conditions, and the acoustic boundary conditions of the system are described in the next section. The corresponding numerical model is then presented in Sec. III. Focus is put on the modeling approach of the acoustic boundary conditions. It is shown that the boundary conditions have a significant influence on the predicted sound pressure field in the configurations investigated. The validity of the numerical model is then challenged in Sec. IV. Velocity profiles are compared between simulations and measurements as well as mean and phase-averaged images of the mean reaction zone submitted to a harmonic flow modulation. Additionally, the generated sound pressure spectrum for a nonreflective LES setup is tested against the analytical prediction of Clavin and Siggia. Last, the numerically computed sound pressure spectra for the three configurations investigated are compared to measured sound pressure spectra. II. Experimental Setup The investigated test rig is a confined premixed swirl combustor sketched in Fig. 1 and located at EM 2 C laboratory. The shaded pink area indicates the domain resolved by the LES. Additionally, the microphone locations (MP, MC, ME, ME’,M E”), the position of the hot-wire probe (HW), and the associated microphone (MHW) are shown. A methane/air mixture is well premixed before it is injected in a tranquilization box, upstream of the plenum. The flow is then laminarized by a perforated plate followed by a honeycomb structure. It then passes through a first convergent (contraction ratio: 8.073) that generates a top-hat velocity profile at the inlet of the LES domain. Up to this position, the upstream parts including the plenum and the contraction have an acoustic equivalent length of 265 mm. A hot-wire probe is used to measure the velocity at the outlet of the convergent, where the diameter is 22 mm. The flow in this section is laminar with a top-hat axial velocity profile. After being pushed through a radial swirler, the fuel/air mixture enters the combustion chamber, which has a square cross section of 82 mm. The resulting turbulent, swirled- stabilized flame is V-shaped, anchored at a cylindrical bluff body that is topped by a cone. The combustion products are exhausted through a water-cooled convergent (contraction ratio: 2.003) with a square-to-round cross section, and an exhaust tube of variable length can be added optionally. The numerical LES domain, highlighted in red in Fig. 1, ends at the outlet of the exhaust convergent. Fig. 1 Sketch ofthe EM 2 C turbulentswirlcombustor for configuration B.

Operating Conditions Experiments are all presented for the same flow operating condition. A perfectly premixed methane/air mixture with an equivalence ratio of ϕ /.0136 0.082 and a thermal power of Pth /.0136 5.05 k W is considered. In the injection tube of diameter D /.0136 22 mm, the resulting bulk flow velocity is ub /.0136 5.04 m ∕s, yielding a Reynolds number of approximately Re /.0136 ub D∕ν ≃ 7000.N o t et h a tt h ef l o wr e m a i n s laminar in this section. Relative fluctuations of thevelocity are less than 2% in the boundary layer and much lower within the core flow. The flow temperature in this section is equal to 300 K. The mean combustor exit velocity and Mach Number areue /.0136 2.08 m ∕s and Ma /.0136 0.00043, respectively. The thermoacoustic state of the combustor is modified by varying the exhaust tube length shown in Fig. 1. Three configurations are investigated and are designated by A, B, and C in the remainder of this study. Without any exhaust tube (configuration A), the system is stable, and no distinct tone emerges from the pressure spectrum. The flame features in this case turbulent fluctuations without any detectable low-frequency self-sustained coherent motion. Adding an exhaust tube of L /.0136 220 mm length on top of the exhaust convergent provokes a mild thermoacoustic instability with intermittent bursts and synchronized pressure oscillations at a frequencyf /.0136 205 Hz (configuration B). The temperature of the gases in the exhaust tube is on average approximately T /.0136 1080 K.I f the exhaust tube length is further increased to L /.0136 440 mm, the instability grows in amplitude and reaches a stable limit cycle with a fixed oscillation amplitudep 0 /.0136 840 Pa in the combustion chamber and an oscillation frequency equal tof /.0136 185 Hz (configuration C). In this case, the average temperature of the gases within the exhaust tube drops to approximately T /.0136 1000 K due to the larger heat transfer to the surrounding. A summary of the three configurations investigated is given in Table 1. The instability atf /.0136 185 Hz is coupled to the 3/4 wave mode of the system. Figure 2 shows that the signal recorded by the microphone located in the plenum (MP, blue) is almost out of phase with respect to the signals measured by the microphones located in the confinement chamber (MC, green) and in the exhaust tube (ME, purple). Simulations carried out with a low-order thermoacoustic model of the combustor yields the same frequency and structure of the acoustic field. B. Diagnostics The thermoacoustic state of the combustor is characterized by the hot-wire probe HW and the microphone MHW placed in front of the hot wire, as sketched in the Fig. 1. The hot wire measures the velocity signal in the tube of 22 mm diameter before the swirler, where the flow is laminar with a top-hat velocity profile. A microphone MP is flush-mounted, before the convergent. A second microphone MC is mounted on a water-cooled wave guide that is itself connected to the backplate of the combustion chamber. Three additional microphones, which are also mounted on water-cooled wave guides, can be inserted on the exhaust tube to measure the combustor outlet reflection coefficient Rout using the three-microphone method. All the microphones are connected to preamplifiers (Brüel & Kjaer Type 4938-A-011) and then connected to a conditioning amplifier (Brüel & Kjaer Type 2690). All microphones are first calibrated with a known sound source (94 d B, 1000 Hz). All signals are sampled at a frequencyfs /.0136 8192 Hz and recorded for a duration of 4 s. This corresponds to around 1000 natural instability cycles for configuration C, of which a few are illustrated in Fig. 2. Optical access in the confinement chamber is granted through the use of quartz walls, which are transparent for both the visible and close ultraviolet wavelengths.OH/.0003 images of the average turbulent flame structure and phase-conditioned images of the flame submitted to external acoustic forcing are recorded with an intensified charge- coupled device (ICCD) camera mounted with an interferometric filter centered on 310 nm with a 10 nm bandwidth. Abel deconvolutions are then performed on these images. Laser Doppler velocimetry is also used to analyze the flow at the swirling injector outlet in the absence of combustion. The three velocity components (axial, radial, and circumferential) velocities are measured by seeding the flow with small oil droplets of 2 μm in diameter. Velocity measurements are made 3 mm above the combustion chamber backplate. C. Acoustic Boundary Conditions Reflection of acoustic waves at the upstream and downstream terminations of the combustor needs to be considered to determine the sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectral content of the acoustic pressure field. At the bottom of the plenum, the test rig is terminated by a metallic thick rigid wall. This boundary is accordingly assumed to be fully reflective without any phase shift and the reflection coefficient is Rin /.0136 1. The same plenum system with the same components up to the injection tube before the hot-wire probe (HW) was already used in previous analysis of self-sustained combustion instabilities [36–38]. In these studies, it was also assumed that the bottom of the burner was a perfectly reflecting rigid plate and that the grid and honeycomb structure were transparent to sound waves. The excellent match in these references between model predictions and measurements for the different acoustic pressure and velocity signals strongly suggests that these assumptions are correct. On the downstream side, the combustor exhaust is open to the atmosphere, and a fraction of the sound is radiated out of the combustor. The reflection coefficient Rout at the downstream end is determined with three microphones mounted on water-cooled wave guides that are introduced on the exhaust tube shown in Fig. 1. The three-microphone method along with coherence functions and the switching method from Chung and Blaser are used to determine Rout between 20 and 500 Hz. These measurements shown in Fig. 3 are carried out for the combustor operating at the nominal condition ϕ /.0136 0.082 and ub /.0136 5.04 m ∕s. It is found that reflection is well reproduced by the Levine and Schwinger model for an open- ended unflanged pipe. III.

To reduce the computational effort, the LES domain is limited to the region downstream of the plenum contraction and upstream of the exhaust tube; see Fig. 1. The unstructured grid consists of approximately 19 million tetrahedral cells with a maximum cell size of 0.06 mm in the flame region and 0.08 mm in the burner flow region, which consists of the swirler and the injection tube. The geometrical details of the swirler are fully modeled. The six radial swirler vanes, which have a diameter of 6 mm, are resolved by approximately 18 cells in the diameter that are refined toward the walls. In total, the swirler part is resolved by about 4 million cells. Mesh independence of the results has been affirmed by testing one coarser and one finer mesh, compared to the reference mesh denoted as Mref. The different mesh resolutions result from a local refinement in the flame region and the upstream flow region. The finer mesh M 3 has a maximum cell size of 0.04 mm in the flame region and 0.06 mm in the upstream flow region, respectively, yielding a total cell number of approximately 34 million cells. For the coarser configuration M 1, the mesh resolution was decreased in the flame region and the upstream flow region to 0.08 and 1.00 mm, respectively. This numerical configuration has a total cell number of approximately 11 million cells. The mesh resolution of the downstream flow region is kept constant with a cell size of 1.04 mm for two reasons. 1) The upstream flow region is of more relevance for the incoming flowfield of the flame and thus for the flame characteristics. 2) Less complex flow dynamics is expected in the downstream region due to the simpler geometry and the elevated viscosity in the burned gas region. Table 2 summarizes the given values of the three meshes. Results of the velocity profiles at the combustion chamber inlet (nonreacting flow) as well as noise spectra (reacting flow) were compared for the three different meshes. Whereas the mean velocity profiles in axial, radial, and circumferential directions are almost identical for all three meshes, the fluctuating components deviate slightly for the coarsest mesh M 1 compared to Mref and M 3. For the reactive case, however, the resulting pressure spectra agree fairly well for all three meshes, even for the coarsest one. It is thus concluded that the results obtained for Mref are mesh independent. Subgrid stresses are handled by the wall adapting linear eddy (WALE) model, whereas interactions between the turbulent flowfield and the flame are described via the dynamically thickened flame model, resolving the laminar flame thickness within seven cells. The reduced two-step BFER scheme is used to reproduce the chemistry of the premixed methane/air flame. All parts upstream of the combustion chamber are assumed to be adiabatic. For the bluff body tip, a temperature of 1000 K is applied, which is in agreement to measured values. For the combustion chamber walls, which are made out of quartz glass, a heat loss boundary condition is used. For that, the experimentally measured temperature at the outside of the quartz wall is imposed at the LES boundaries as a reference temperature and an according thermal resistance is defined. This allows the wall temperature in LES to have a spatially nonuniform temperature distribution and to adapt to the internal temperature field. The metallic combustor dump plate is assumed to have an isothermal temperature of 823 K. With these imposed wall temperatures and the respective heat losses, the exhaust gas temperature at the LES domain outlet is in good accordance with the measured mean exhaust gas temperature of configuration A of approximately 1150 K. Reproducing the temperatures and thus the speed of sound accurately in LES is of importance to correctly predict the frequencies of the thermoacoustically unstable modes and the resulting sound pressure spectra in general. To correctly model the acoustic transmission and reflection of the up- and downstream components of the test rig that are not included in the numerical domain, the LES domain is coupled to characteristics-based state-space boundary conditions (CBSBCs), which are described later in this section. A. Extracting Acoustic Pressure Fluctuations It has been proposed to combine incompressible LES with a source model based on the spatiotemporal variations of heat release fluctuations to predict combustion noise [47–49]. Alternatively, a fully compressible formulation of the Navier –Stokes equations allows to assess combustion noise directly and without the need of a source model. However, the pressure signal in a compressible LES is a superposition of the acoustic and hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations, which may make the separation of the two contributions challenging. Turbulent and acoustic fluctuations cover the same range of amplitudes and frequencies or are at least in the same order of magnitude. In the present study, the method of characteristics-based filtering (CBF) is used to extract the acoustic pressure fluctuations from the LES pressure field. This method exploits the difference in propagation speed between turbulent and acoustic fluctuations and allows to identify acoustic waves in turbulent compressible flows. B. Modeling of Acoustic Boundaries As already mentioned, correct acoustic modeling at boundaries of the numerical domain is crucial for predicting the sound pressure field inside the system as well as its thermoacoustic stability. Acoustic reflections at the boundaries may cause, for example, peaks in the sound pressure spectrum due to resonant amplification of acoustic eigenmodes or may couple with the flame dynamics to provoke a thermoacoustic instability. The acoustic characteristics of all components upstream and downstream of the numerical domain that are present in the test rig but are not resolved directly by LES and need to be modeled in an appropriate manner (see Fig. 4). This is achieved in the present study by using the characteristics-based state- space boundary conditions (CBSBCs) proposed by Jaensch et al, which are a variant of time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC) [32,51–53]. a) Modulus of Rout b) Phase of Rout Fig. 3 Comparison between measured reflection coefficient (circles) and model of Levine and Schwinger for an open-ended unflanged pipe (dashed line).

Like the NSCBCs, the CBSBCs avoid a drift of the mean flow variables. But whereas the NSCBCs yield a reflection coefficient of a first-order low-pass filter, the CBSBCs make use of plane wave masking yielding a fully nonreflective behavior also at low frequencies. This behavior is achieved by an extension of the linear relaxation term of the NSCBCs that explicitly eliminates outgoing wave contributions from the linear relaxation term. To identify accurately the outgoing wave contributions from the turbulent compressible flowfield, the CBF method is again applied. In the present context, the main benefit of the CBSBCs is that they allow also to impose an ingoing wave, which effectively emulates a time-domain impedance with complete control over the phase and magnitude of the reflection coefficient. This is not feasible with the standard NSCBC formulation. This flexible and individual control of magnitude and phase allows to set complex reflection coefficients to the numerical domain. An exact description of the reflection conditions at the LES domain boundaries is achieved by imposing the measured impedances. Because of the impact of the CBSBCs on the resulting sound pressure spectra, the coupling of the LES to the state-space model of the acoustic subsystem is explained in more detail. This is exemplarily done for the inlet boundary condition that describes the acoustic propagation within the plenum tube and the fully reflective plenum bottom. First, the upstream traveling characteristic wave gu /.0136 1 /.0018 p 0 a /.0022ρ /.0022 c − u 0 a /.0019 u (1) which is leaving the LES domain, is extracted by the CBF method. Herein, p 0 a and u 0 a represent the acoustic pressure and velocity fluctuation, respectively, whereas/.0022ρ and /.0022 c refer to the mean values of density and speed of sound. The CBF filtering allows a proper separation between acoustic and turbulent fluctuations by exploiting their different propagation speeds. Whereas the acoustic perturbations propagate with the speed of sound, turbulent fluctuations are transported with the convective velocity. In a next step, the extracted characteristic wavegu serves as an input for the state-space model, which describes the acoustic processes downstream of the LES domain: _x /.0136 Ax /.0135 Bgu (2 a) fu /.0136 Cx /.0135 Dgu (2 b) Herein, x denotes the state-vector of the boundary model. The model itself depends on the system matrices A, B, C, and D, which describe the acoustic properties of the state-space model. As demonstrated by Jaensch et al, there are different approaches to determine the system matrices A, B, C, and D (e.g. from a set of partial differential equations, from a polynomial fit of measured reflection conditions at discrete frequencies, or even from an acoustic network model). To help the reader to develop a better physical understanding of the state-space model in Eq. (2), the state-space model used for the inlet boundary condition is constructed in the following from a set of partial differential equations. The linearized Euler equations describe the plane wave acoustics within the plenum and read as ∂f ∂t /.0135/.0133 /.0022 u /.0135 /.0022 c/.0134 ∂f ∂x /.0136 0 (3 a) ∂g ∂t /.0135/.0133 /.0022 u − /.0022 c/.0134 ∂g ∂x /.0136 0 (3 b) with /.0022 u denoting the mean convective velocity within the plenum. Following the notation introduced in Fig. 5, the partial differential equation system is closed by the boundary conditions g/.0133 x /.0136 0;t /.0134/.0136 g 1 /.0136 gu (4 a) f/.0133 x /.0136 L; t/.0134/.0136 f N /.0136 Rin ⋅ g/.0133 x /.0136 L; t/.0134 (4 b) The boundary condition atx /.0136 0 provides the characteristic wave gu, which is extracted from the LES, as input to the boundary state- space model. Atx /.0136 L, the reflected wavef N is described in terms of the imposed reflection coefficient Rin. After applying a spatial discretization of the plenum (e.g. a linear upwind finite difference scheme), Eqs.

The interpretation of the constructed state-space model is the following. The state vector xcontains the values off and g at the discrete locations. The state matrix A is mainly determined by the discretization scheme and describes the wave propagation along the characteristics on its main diagonals. However, the off-diagonal element relates the valuesf N−1 and g N in terms of the prescribed reflection coefficient Rin. The vector B denotes the input vector and describes the influence of the input quantity gu on the system. The output vector C defines which values of the state vectorx serve as outputs and are consequently fed back into the LES. In the present case, only the value corresponding to f 1 /.0136 fu is nonzero, meaning that, at the LES inlet, an acoustic wave is imposed with fu /.0136 1 /.0018 p 0 a /.0022ρ /.0022 c /.0135 u 0 a /.0019 u (8) Here, fu is the time-lagged reflection of the acoustic wavegu. The time lag depends on the length of the plenum L and the speed of sound c. Because no additional external excitation is imposed at the LES inlet, the feedthrough vector D is a null vector. The coupling between LES and CBSBC at the outlet of the numerical domain is established in an analogous manner. However, the respective state-space model is constructed from a polynomial function, representing the Levine–Schwinger conditions for an open unflanged pipe. For the details of this alternative approach and further information on the CBSBC formulation, the reader is referred to the publication of Jaensch et al. Note that the coupling of a compressible LES to CBSBC was already used successfully by Jaensch et al and Tudisco et al. C. Acoustic Boundary Conditions of the Numerical Domain The three configurations A, B, and C feature different reflection coefficients at the boundaries of the numerical domain. All three configurations share the same acoustic impedance at the numerical domain inlet, which is characterized by the reflection coefficient Rin shown in Fig. 6. This boundary condition models the acoustic impedance of the plenum terminated by a rigid wall. According to the hard wall at the upstream end of the plenum (see Sec. II.C), the absolute value of the reflection coefficient remains constant and equal to unity across all frequenciesj Rinj/.0136 1. The plenum itself introduces a frequency-dependent phase lag that only depends on the plenum length and the speed of sound within the plenum. For the given plenum, the acoustic equivalent length ofl /.0136 265 mm,a n d the speed of sound ofc /.0136 340 m ∕s, a phase lag as shown in Fig. 6 b results. The outlet reflection coefficient Rout, however, changes between the three configurations studied and has a major impact upon the resulting sound pressure spectra in the combustion chamber. Because all three configurations are open-ended, the magnitude of Rout is thus the same for all three configurations. The Levine– Schwinger condition for an open-ended unflanged pipe is applied as shown in Fig. 7 a. Even though experimental data are only available up to 500 Hz, the analytical expression allows a reliable definition of the reflection coefficient in the LES up to higher frequencies. But for a better readability, only the frequency range [0–1000 Hz] is depicted in Fig. 7. The reflection coefficient Rout at the numerical domain outlet is fully reflective in the low-frequency limit and introduces a slight decrease of the reflection magnitude with increasing frequencies. The decay rate of∠Rout is a function of the exhaust tube length, diameter, and speed of sound. For configuration A, the Levine–Schwinger condition can directly be used for Rout, as shown by Fig. 7 b (orange). However, for configurations B and C, an additional phase lag has to be taken into account due to the additional length of the exhaust tube. This phase lag increases linearly with the exhaust tube length. For both configurations, a mean speed of sound of c /.0136 634 m ∕s was assumed, corresponding to a mean exhaust gas temperature of Tout /.0136 1000 K. Figure 7 b also shows the phase of the reflection coefficient for configurations B (orange) and C (green). a) Modulus of Rin b) Phase of Rin Fig. 6 Complex inlet reflection coefficient Rin used in numerical model for the three configurations A, B, and C.

Results An overview of the LES carried out for the different cases explored is given in Table 1 together with the dynamic state of the system observed in the experiments. Note that the plenum and exhaust tubes could also be modeled directly by the LES, similar to the setup of Franzelli et al, but this would significantly increase the numerical domain size and thus the computational effort. Moreover, a remeshing would be necessary for every configuration investigated. The chosen coupling of LES and CBSBC allows to analyze changes in acoustic impedance at the numerical domain boundaries by a simple reformulation of the state-space model. Practically, this means that the LES numerical domain remains the same for all three configurations, and the resulting instability only arises due to the reformulation of the boundary state-space model at the numerical domain outlet. A. Velocity Profiles The velocities measured by LDV in the experiments are first compared to the numerical results under cold flow operation for a bulk velocity ofub /.0136 5.04 m ∕s at the numerical domain inlet. In LES, the averaging time amounts to 240 ms and corresponds thus to approximately 16 flow trough times. The velocity profiles are compared 3 mm above the combustion chamber dump plate. Figures 8 a–8 c show an excellent agreement for all three velocity components between measurements and LES computations. In this figure, the radial distancex to the burner axis is normalized by the injector outlet radius R /.0136 10 mm. The radial location of the velocity peaks and their associated amplitudes are correctly predicted by the numerical results. The measured rms values are slightly less well reproduced by the simulations. The rms values of the axial velocity are still in fairly in good agreement in Fig. 8 d between experiments and LES, whereas the rms velocity profiles of the radial and circumferential velocity profile show some discrepancy in Figs. 8 e and 8 f. Even though the respective total values are in the same range of magnitude, the values downstream the bluff body close tox∕R /.0136 0 and in the outer shear layer x∕R /.0006 1 differ slightly. One possible reason might be that the relatively short time in the LES over which averages were made is not long enough to converge toward the correct average values that were found to be statistically independent of the number of samples in the experiments. The LDV measurements are also averaged over the collection volume probed by the laser beams. This might also introduce a small bias in the measurements, especially in the regions of high shear due to the large gradients. The overall comparison between mean and rms velocity profiles for the three velocity components, however, yields satisfying agreement for the cold flow condition explored. B. Shape of Mean Reaction Zone Because velocity measurements are only available for cold flow conditions, as a first step, the comparison with simulations is further investigated in reacting conditions by examining the mean reaction zone shape.

The combustor dump plate and the central bluff body are sketched in gray. The flow is directed from bottom to top. On the left-hand side, the distribution of the volumetric heat release rate calculated by LES is depicted. Results are normalized by the maximum value found in the simulation and averaged over data accumulated over 120 ms. The right-hand side of Fig. 9 shows the Abel transform of the OH/.0003 experimental signal recorded over 100 frames with an exposure time of 20 ms for each snapshot. Five frames were taken each second, which amounts to a total integration time of 20 s. At this point, it is emphasized that the measured mean reaction zone shape and the one resulting from LES can only be compared to a certain extent. The measured Abel transformed images depict the OH/.0003 chemilumines- cence distribution, whereas LES results represent the mean reaction zone in terms of heat release rate. The global two-step reaction scheme of the LES cannot be used to infer the OH/.0003 distribution. Figure 9 indicates that the simulated mean reaction zone shape is in reasonable agreement with that observed in experiments. Even though the flame angle at the injector outlet differs by about 12 deg, the positions of the flame leading edge and the flame height are fairly well reproduced by the LES. The flame length is an essential feature that governs the cutoff frequency of the flame transfer function and has also be shown to be an important parameter that governs the peak frequency of the broadband combustion noise radiated by unconfined flames. A reasonable reproduction of the flame length is thus compulsory to reproduce the sound pressure spectra. In configuration C, the system is unstable, and the oscillation reaches a limit cycle with a frequency of 185 Hz. This is also what is observed in the numerical simulation of this configuration. A comparison is made of phase-averaged flame images in Fig. 10. These pictures shed additional light on the flame dynamics and the flame motion during one oscillation cycle. The images recorded in the experiments, on the right-hand side in Fig. 10, show OH/.0003 phase-averaged and Abel transformed images. In this case, each frame corresponds to an exposure time of 40 μs, and results are averaged over 100 frames. These images are synchronized with respect to the velocity signal measured by the hot-wire probe HW in the injection tube, shown in Fig. 11. The mean reaction zone shapes from LES, shown on the left-hand side in Fig. 10, are represented by a heat release rate isocontour averaged over 20 frames at the same phase angles in the oscillation cycle as in the experiments. The time covered by the 20 LES frames adds up to approximately 110 ms. Every LES flowfield is sliced along thex axis, they axis, and the two bisectors, yielding in total eight flame halves to average across per frame. In the LES, the sampling frequency is set constant and equal to a sixth of the oscillation frequency of the instability. Because of small cycle-to-cycle variations caused by the acoustic velocity fluctuations induced by the flame, the phase angle of the respective snapshots (×) is slightly varying in respect to the inlet velocity signal.

The general flame motion during the oscillation cycle is satisfyingly described by the compressible LES in Fig. 10. The position of the largest structures of the flame and the respective flame length are fairly well reproduced by the LES at each phase of the oscillation cycle. Flame length increase per phase increase is captured by the simulation as well as the radial flame extension observed in the experiments. Despite the limitations of this qualitative comparison, such as the slightly varying phase angle of the respective snapshots or the comparison between OH/.0003 chemiluminescence and heat release rate, it can be concluded that the compressible LES is capable of describing the main important features of the flame motion during a limit-cycle oscillation. C. Sound Pressure Spectra The acoustic pressure time series recorded in the experiments are statistically averaged by the use of Welch’s power spectral estimate because a direct use of the fast Fourier transform has no meaning for noisy signals over a finite duration of time. Thirty-two Blackman– Harris windows are used with an overlap of 50% over the 4-s-long experimental time series. The numerical time series are postprocessed with only three Blackman–Harris windows because they have a length of only 360 ms. The sound pressure level (SPL) is defined here as SPL /.0136 20 × log 10 /.0018 p 0 rms pref /.0019 (9) with a reference pressure pref /.0136 2. × 10−5 Pa. Sound pressure signatures are compared between experiments and simulations for the microphone MC set in the combustion chamber (see Fig. 1). A first calculation is made by imposing perfectly nonreflective boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the numerical domain. This situation mimics an open flame radiating noise as long as the acoustic wavelength is significantly larger than the characteristic transverse dimensions of the combustor. The power spectral density of the SPL signal is here compared to the theoretical spectrum from Clavin and Siggia. Their analytical scaling law is based on the assumption of a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum and predicts that the power spectral density of the noise radiated by an unconfined turbulent flame features a decay proportional tof−2.05, wheref is the frequency. Figure 12 shows the computed sound pressure spectrum for nonreflective boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet (gray). By determining from LES the bulk flow velocity at the combustion chamber inlet uave and the distance between the maximum heat release and the burner exit plane Lf, the Strouhal number scaling proposed by Winkler et al can be applied: St /.0136 fpeak Lf uave ≃ 1 (10) From LES, the values ofuave /.0136 7.01 m ∕s and Lf ≃ 0.0028 m are found, resulting in an estimated peak frequency offpeak ≃ 250 Hz. The spectral decay rate above the peak frequency is well reproduced by the decaying scaling law of Clavin and Siggia (dashed line). One may conclude that all relevant mechanisms responsible for the generation and propagation of acoustic waves in the turbulent combustion process are described qualitatively correct by the LES. Additionally, the sound pressure spectrum of the nonreflective case is overlaid with the sound pressure spectrum that results from applying the fully reflective boundary conditions of configuration A (orange). Even though the spectrum for configuration A is discussed in more detail in the next section, two aspects are already worth emphasizing at this point. First, compared to the reflecting conditions of configuration A, no distinct peaks emerge from the pressure spectrum if nonreflective boundary conditions are applied. Second, the general spectral shape of the case with nonreflecting boundary conditions is preserved in the spectrum of configuration A. Especially the spectral rolloff at higher frequencies is also visible for configuration A, although distinct peaks resulting from cavity resonances are observable. Figure 13 shows on the left 100 ms of the computed pressure time series (orange) for configuration A when the system is stable with respect to thermoacoustic instabilities but features reflection at its inlet and outlet. The exhibited pressure fluctuations of the time series remain small. On the right-hand side, the measured (green) and computed (orange) sound pressure power spectral distributions are depicted. One observes a remarkable agreement between the measured and simulated values. In the low-frequency limit, the slope of the pressure spectral distribution and its level are in overall good agreement. The level at the peak frequency at around 500 Hz is slightly overpredicted by 7 d B in the LES. This slight difference between measurements and the LES is mainly attributed to the differences in the mean reaction zone shape, observed in Fig. 9. This is believed to be the main origin of discrepancies in the low-frequency region and at the peak frequency. The subsequent measured decay of the SPL is well reproduced by LES coupled to CBSBCs. The slight difference between measurements and the LES prediction in the region of the local minimum around 1500 Hz can be mainly attributed to the uncertainties in the thermal boundaries. Inaccuracies in the temperature field yield to a shift of frequencies in the LES, especially in the higher-frequency regions. According to theory and the spectral distribution of the nonreflective configuration shown in Fig. 12, the combustion noise source in Fig. 13 is mainly active in the midfrequency region up to 300 Hz and rolls off to higher frequencies. However, the spectral sound pressure distribution is no longer completely flat over the whole frequency range. The appearance of the peak at 500 Hz with an amplitude of approximately 120 d B may be seen as the combustor resonance. The broadband noise emitted by the flame goes in resonance with the system cavities.

By using a linear acoustic network model of the combustor, the resonant peak in the sound pressure spectrum of configuration A can be identified as the 3∕4λ wave mode of the system that is resonating. Nonetheless, the combustion remains stable, and the overall SPL magnitude remains at a moderate level. Figure 14 shows the results obtained for configuration B featuring an intermittent thermoacoustic instability at an oscillation of approximately 205 Hz. The computed time series shown in Fig. 14 a demonstrates the intermittent behavior that manifests in the pressure signal. A distinct oscillating frequency is observable that grows in amplitude. At a certain amplitude level, the oscillation breaks down and starts to grow again. With respect to the time series shown in Fig. 13 a, larger pressure fluctuations are reached. Compared to the pressure spectrum shown in Fig. 13 b for the stable configuration A, an elevated SPL is reached in Fig. 14 with a peak amplitude of approximately 140 d B. The resulting SPL peak amplitude measured in the experiments is correctly reproduced by LES, with a difference of less than 5 d B. The rest of the spectral sound pressure distribution is also well reproduced by the simulation with a broad hump around 1000 Hz and a second smaller one at about 1750 Hz. Using LES to simulate the spectral distribution of the sound pressure in presence of a thermoacoustic instability is a challenging task. The peak frequency and the peak amplitude significantly depend on the nonlinear coupling between acoustics and flame dynamics. In the respective sound pressure spectrum, this manifests by a peak at the frequency of the instability. The fully compressible LES strategy coupled with CBSBC is, however, capable of resolving directly both contributions and consequently also their nonlinear interaction. The main difference observed in configuration B is the spread of spectral energy around the peak frequency, which is much larger in the simulation than in the experiment. This might be due to the slight difference in the mean reaction zone shape already noticed in Fig. 9. But it is also worth recalling that regime B is unstable by intermittence, meaning that the system does not reach a well defined limit cycle at a constant oscillation frequency and amplitude. The lock on of the instability frequency with the combustor resonant frequency is only achieved intermittently. This is a challenging configuration, in which subtle changes of the flow alter the thermoacoustic state of the system. Differences in turbulence might be the origin of the broader peak observed in the simulation. The reader is reminded that this simulation is carried out by modifying only the reflection coefficient at the numerical domain outlet with the model shown in Fig. 7 (orange). This change is enough to reproduce the thermoacoustic instability in the LES with yet a reasonable match with experiments of the spectral content below 2000 Hz. In addition to the pressure signal measured by microphone MC located in the combustion chamber, the signals measured by the microphones MP in the plenum and ME in the exhaust tube (see Fig. 1) are also compared to the computed data for configuration B. Note that the LES domain does not comprise the locations of MP and ME. The pressure signals needed for computing the respective sound pressure spectra cannot be extracted directly from the LES. Instead, the pressure time series are reconstructed from the state-space model used within the CBSBC. Therefore, the characteristic acoustic waves leaving the LES domain are stored during the computation. In an additional postprocessing step, these signals are used as input signals to simulate the boundary state-space model forward in time and thus compute the pressure signal at a given location. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 15. The sound pressure spectrum measured by microphone MP located in the plenum exhibits smaller pressure amplitudes over all frequencies compared to the signal measured by microphone MC in the combustion chamber. This is correctly predicted by the reconstructed numerical spectrum in Fig. 15 a, even though certain differences are observed for frequencies higher than 1000 Hz. The reconstruction of the signal in the exhaust tube at the microphone location ME is in very good agreement with the measured spectrum in Fig. 15 b.

The secondary bumps at around 1000 and 1600 Hz are well captured by the reconstructed spectrum. As already mentioned for the pressure spectra shown in Fig. 14, the main differences between the measured and reconstructed spectra in the plenum and exhaust tube are the width of the pressure peak of the thermoacoustic instability. It is emphasized that the explained reconstruction procedure would not be applicable for TDIBC like they are used, for example, by Lourier et al, in which the acoustic boundary impedances are modeled globally. Yet the used CBSBC describes duct sections within the state- space model as spatially discretized elements on which an advection equation is solved numerically. The according state variables may be assessed at every discretized element. Therefore, the CBSBC provides also spatial information of the state variables within the boundary model. However, the reconstructed pressure time series directly depend on the input time series (i.e. the extracted characteristic waves at the LES domain boundary). Errors made in the LES propagate directly into the reconstructed time series. Nevertheless, the overall good agreement between measured and reconstructed sound pressure spectrum proves that the CBSBC allows to reconstruct the main features of the measured signals even out of the LES numerical domain. Last, the sound pressure spectrum obtained from LES (green) is compared to the measured one (blue) in configuration C at the limit cycle of the instability in Fig. 16. The thermoacoustic instability has a peak frequency of 185 Hz where the SPL reaches 150 d B in the combustion chamber. The LES now well reproduces not only the correct peak value of the pressure oscillation but also the same shape of the power spectral distribution around this frequency. The self- sustained oscillation reaches in this case a much larger oscillation amplitude ofu 0∕ /.0022 u /.0136 0.07 at the hot-wire location in the injection tube. Compared to the intermittent configuration B, a well-defined limit cycle is reached in configuration C. In this case, reproducing turbulent fluctuations is of less importance for the determination of the exact thermoacoustic state around the instability frequency. This may explain why the shape of the spectral distribution is better reproduced in configuration C compared to the intermittent state B. However, in the region above 500 Hz, a slight shift of the LES results to higher frequencies is observable. Again, this is probably due to the uncertainties regarding the temperatures in the exhaust tube region. If the mean gas temperature in the CBSCB model is overestimated, a shift to higher frequencies results. Compared to the stable configuration A without exhaust tube (L /.0136 0) and a peak frequency around 500 Hz, the distinctively lower value of the peak frequency in configuration C is explained by the elongated cavity (L /.0136 440 mm ) that shifts the acoustic modes to lower frequencies. As for configuration B, the instability in the LES is only provoked through a change of the outlet reflection condition of the numerical domain according to the model shown in Fig. 7 (green). Also for configuration C, in which the thermoacoustic instability is even more pronounced than in configuration B, the compressible LES coupled to CBSBC reproduces accurately the measured data for the sound pressure spectral distribution. V. Conclusions In the present study, the spectral sound pressure distribution of a confined lab-scale swirl combustor has been investigated by combining experiments and simulations. The flowfield and the mean reaction zone shape have been characterized as well as the acoustic fields for thermoacoustic stable, intermittently unstable, and unstable states of the test rig. The burner is operated with a methane/air mixture of constant flow injection conditions; the stability is only varied by changing the exhaust tube length. The turbulent flowfield, the flame, and the acoustics are resolved by performing fully compressible large-eddy simulation (LES) computations. It has been shown that the correct description of the complex acoustic boundary conditions from the test rig in the numerical approach is of crucial importance to correctly predict the resulting sound pressure spectrum and the sound level. The CBSBC formulation has proven itself to be very convenient for the description of the acoustic boundaries in the computational approach.

Consequently, the thermoacoustically stable as well as the unstable combustion regimes could be well reproduced by a simple reformulation of the boundary inherent state-space model. The acoustic pressure fluctuations are extracted via a characteristics- based filter from the compressible LES. Accordingly, computed sound pressure spectra have been compared to the measured spectra. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement of resulting sound pressure spectra has been achieved for stable and unstable working conditions. Slight differences were identified for the intermittent unstable regime, probably due to difficulties in reproducing the same turbulent flow and reacting fields in the LES. But even in this case, the developed strategy could reproduce the main spectral features of the measured data with a fairly good fidelity. This holds not only for the combustion chamber that is comprised in the LES domain. Also the sound pressure spectra within the plenum and exhaust tube, which are located outside the numerical domain, could be reconstructed from the boundary state-space model.

The method may be summarised as follows: a simulated ﬂame is forced with a broadband excitation signal. The resulting ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity and of the global heat release rate are post-processed via SI techniques in order to estimate a low-order model of the ﬂame dynamics. The FTF is readily deduced from the low-order model. The SI method most frequently applied in aero- and thermo-acoustics has been Wiener–Hopf Inversion (WHI). This method is known to yield biased estimates in situations with feedback, thus it was assumed that non-reﬂective boundary conditions are required to generate accurate results with the LES/SI approach. Recent research has shown that the FTF is part of the so-called Intrinsic Thermo Acoustic (ITA) feedback loop. Hence, identifying an FTF from a compressible LES is always a closed-loop problem, and consequently one should expect that the WHI would yield biased results. However, several studies proved that WHI results compare favourably with validation data. To resolve this apparent contradiction, a variety of identiﬁcation methods are compared against each other, including models designed for closed-loop identiﬁcation. In agreement with theory, we show that the estimate given by WHI does not converge to theactual FTF. Fortunately, the error made is small if excitation amplitudes can be set such that the signal-to-noise ratio is large, but not large enough to trigger nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. Furthermore, we conclude that non-reﬂective boundary conditions are not essentially necessary to apply the LES/SI approach.

Introduction The development of low-emission gas turbine combustion technology for propulsion or power generation is often hampered by the occurrence of thermoacoustic instabilities. A self-amplifying feedback between the unsteady heat release of the ﬂame and the acoustic ﬁeld can result in large oscillations of the ﬂow variables. These oscillations can cause serious damage to an engine. Thermoacoustic network models have proven themselves as a useful tool for predicting frequencies, growth rates, and mode shapes of thermoacoustic instabilities at negligible computational cost [1–6]. Finite-element based models of acoustics are advantageous for more complex combustor geometries or higher frequencies [ 7–9]. Hybrid formulations combine advantages of both methods [ 10]. All these approaches require information on the ﬂame dynamics as model input. In the low-amplitude, low-frequency regime, such *Corresponding author: merk@tfd.mw.tum.de C⃝ 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group A.2 P APER -SI FTF, Combust. Theor. Model.

Jaensch et al information is represented via a Flame Transfer Function (FTF), which relates ﬂuctuations of ﬂow variables upstream of the ﬂame to the resulting ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate. If the fuel injection is acoustically ‘stiff’ and located only a short distance, i.e. a fraction of pertinent acoustic wavelengths, upstream of the ﬂame, an FTF that relates upstream ﬂow velocity to heat release is sufﬁcient to describe the relevant ﬂame dynamics fully [ 11]. Such an FTF, which is mandatory to predict thermoacoustic stability, can be determined experimentally by forcing a ﬂame with a harmonic signal at several distinct frequencies. The resulting ﬂuctuations of velocity at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame and of global heat release rate are measured. Finally, gain and phase of the FTF at the forcing frequencies are calculated via a Fourier transform. In principle, the very same procedure can be applied to a numerical simulation of a ﬂame, but necessitates a large number of compute runs, i.e. one simulation per frequency. For conﬁgurations of applied interest, the accurate numerical computation of a turbulent ﬂame requires Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which is computationally demanding. It follows that the frequency-by-frequency determination of an FTF from LES data is prohibitively expensive for many applications. Polifke proposed forcing the ﬂame simulation with a broadband signal and to use tools from System Identiﬁcation (SI) [ 13–15] in order to determine the FTF from the time series data. This approach allows a reduced-order model to be determined for the FTF from a single simulation run, with signiﬁcant savings in computational costs. In the majority of applications to date, SI of ﬂame dynamics relied on correlation analysis, and in particular inversion of the Wiener–Hopf equation, which relates auto- and cross-correlation of input and output signals to each other via the impulse response [ 16–26]. This procedure is based on the minimisation of the correlation between input signal and noise contribution and yields an accurate and unbiased estimate of the FTF as long as the input signal and the noise contribution are uncorrelated in the system under study. This is for example the case for an open-loop system. However, if a feedback mechanism is present, as for example under closed-loop conditions, a correlation between input signal and noise contribution results. It is known from literature on SI that in this case the Wiener– Hopf Inversion (WHI) yields incorrect results [ 13–15]. In order to avoid possible feedback and thus closed-loop conditions, non-reﬂective Boundary Conditions (BCs) were deemed necessary in LES to generate accurate results via the WHI procedure. Recently, Bomberg, Emmert, and Polifke [ 29] have shown that the FTF is part of the ITA feedback loop, which is illustrated and explained in Figure 1. Consequences of ITA feedback, such as unstable thermoacoustic modes in an anechoic environment, thermoacoustic modes that are not related to acoustic cavity modes, convective scaling of FTF ˙q′(t)u′(t) g Figure 1. ITA feedback: a velocity ﬂuctuation u′(t) causes a ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate ˙q′(t). The ﬂuctuation of the heat release rate generates an acoustic wave g travelling in the upstream direction, where it modulates the velocity at the reference location, thereby closing the feedback loop.

Note that the ITA feedback loop does not rely on reﬂection of acoustic waves at the domain boundaries. It is inevitably present in thermoacoustic systems with a velocity-sensitive ﬂame and is inherently resolved by a fully compressible ﬂow simulation of a ﬂame. Non-reﬂecting acoustic boundary conditions do not eliminate ITA feedback, but may on the contrary render a stable ITA mode unstable [ 36,37]. Hence, identifying the FTF from a compressible LES is unavoidably a closed-loop problem. To conclude, the literature on SI suggests that WHI should not be capable of accurately estimating the FTF from a compressible LES due to the inherent and unavoidable ITA feedback. Furthermore, LES of a turbulent ﬂame explicitly resolves large-scale turbulent ﬂuc- tuations, which manifest themselves as noise, i.e. a broadband contribution to the output signal that is uncorrelated with the excitation signal. One should expect that noise will worsen the accuracy of SI, in particular if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is small, and indeed Biagioli, Scarpato, and Syed [ 24] observed this problem in their LES/SI study of a turbulent swirling ﬂame. An increase of the excitation amplitude will increase the SNR and thus can alleviate this problem. However, if the excitation is too strong, the ﬂame response will exhibit nonlinear effects, which should be avoided in linear identiﬁcation [ 12–15]. Again one might conclude that the LES/SI approach based on WHI should not be capable of providing accurate low-order models of ﬂame dynamics. On the other hand, validation of WHI results against FTFs determined frequency-by-frequency (in experiment as well as in simulation) have repeatedly delivered very satisfactory agreement. In the present work we investigate these apparent contradictions with a surrogate data model that simulates a thermoacoustic network model in the time domain. For generating surrogate time series data, a certain reference FTF is assumedap r i o r i. The knowledge on the reference or actual FTF can be used in the following to assess directly the quality of the models that are identiﬁed from the surrogate time series data. A perfectly identiﬁed model would coincide exactly with theactual FTF, which is the true solution, as it is used for generating the surrogate data in the ﬁrst place. Note that the true solution is usually unknown when LES data is used. So the advantage of the surrogate data approach is that the actual FTF of the model is known and can be used as reference. In consistence with the theory [ 15] we demonstrate that results of the WHI do not converge to the actual FTF even for very long time series. On the other hand, if the system identiﬁcation is based on the so-called Box–Jenkins (BJ) model, the error decays for long time series, even in the presence of feedback. We will demonstrate that the error made by the WHI depends on the amplitude of the excitation signal relative to the noise level. If the SNR is sufﬁciently large, the error is small – which is why the WHI did repeatedly provide satisfactory results when applied to real data. This resolves the paradox noted above. Our results also indicate that acoustic reﬂection at the system boundaries does not introduce additional errors. Therefore, any boundary condition that stabilises the simulation can be used for the LES/SI approach. This extends signiﬁcantly the range of conﬁgurations where the LES/SI approach can be applied. The paper is organised as follows: in the next section, we discuss the thermoacoustic network model used to generate the surrogate data in detail. The theory behind SI is addressed in Section 3. In Section 4 the results are illustrated by means of numerical examples. A.2 P APER -SI FTF, Combust. Theor. Model.

The surrogate data is generated with a network model mimicking an LES conﬁguration that is set up to generate time series data for SI. The surrogate model used in this study represents a turbulent swirl burner that was designed and investigated by Komarek and Polifke [ 38]. This burner is particularly suited for the present investigation, because ITA feedback plays an important role in its dynamics and thermoacoustic stability. The surrogate network model was originally formulated by Silva, Merk, Komarek, and Polifke and may divided into two main parts (see Figure 2): (1) a model for the ﬂame dynamics, represented by the FTF; and (2) a model for the acoustics. In the context of the present study, the most signiﬁcant advantage of a surrogate data approach is that the actual FTF is known precisely and can serve as reference for the estimation of the FTF from time series generated with the surrogate model. Furthermore, the computational cost for generating even very long time series is negligible, such that one can explore the asymptotic behaviour of various system identiﬁcation strategies. 2.01. Modelling of the ﬂame dynamics We model the ﬂame response using a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model ˙q′ u′(t) = nb∑ i=0 biu′(t − i/Delta 1 t), (1) with the nb impulse response coefﬁcients bi, the model time step /Delta 1 t, and ˙q′ u′(t)a st h e ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate induced by the velocity ﬂuctuation u′(t) upstream of the ﬂame. The FIR model accounts for the physical effects that dominate the ﬂame response. Com- pact, perfectly premixed ﬂames are known to be velocity sensitive, i.e. the ﬂame responds predominantly to axial velocity ﬂuctuations upstream of the ﬂame (see e.g. [ 29,33]). The FIR model accounts for this as the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release is deduced from the ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity.

In order to understand the physics behind the ﬂame response it is convenient to consider an impulse velocity ﬂuctuation imposed on the ﬂame, as proposed by Blumenthal, Subramanian, Sujith, and Polifke [ 39]. A velocity perturbation at the ﬂame foot causes a distortion of the ﬂame at the anchoring point. The distortion is convected along the ﬂame front and causes a ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. Simultaneously, as discussed in [ 39], starting from the anchoring point the unperturbed ﬂame position and shape are restored. The restoration process is also a convective effect. Once the perturbative and the restorative effects are convected through the ﬂame, the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate vanishes. Therefore, the response of the ﬂame to a velocity impulse isﬁnite and can be modelled with a ﬁnite impulse response model. The length of the impulse response is given as τ = nb/Delta 1 t. (2) This allows the number of coefﬁcients nb of the FIR model to be determined: nb = τ /Delta 1 t. (3) Therefore, the use of an FIR model is on a profound, physically motivated basis as the model design corresponds to the convective nature of the effects that govern the dynamic response of the ﬂame. Note that the lengthτ of the impulse response describes the ‘memory’ of the FIR model. If it is chosen shorter than the physical time delay of the ﬂame impulse response τ, the FTF is said to be under-resolved and the ﬂame response is insufﬁciently described. If the ﬂame response time is chosen too long, the impulse response coefﬁcients bi start to describe stochastic perturbations if noise is present. From LES the physical time delay of the ﬂame impulse response is known as τ = 0.015 s. The LES time series data is down-sampled to /Delta 1 t = 5 × 10−4 s yielding a ﬁlter length nb = 30. The coefﬁcients bi of the FIR model used by the network model were determined via SI with WHI, based on LES data of the turbulent swirl burner generated by L. Tay-Wo-Chong. In Figure 3, the corresponding FTF is shown and compared against experimental measurements. 0.05 1.05 ∥FTF(f)∥ 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 −15 −10 −5 f [Hz] ∠FTF(f) Figure 3.

Jaensch et al The purpose of this ﬁgure is to demonstrate that the identiﬁed FTF is qualitatively correct (overall low-pass, but with excess gain) and quantitatively accurate in the frequency range where instabilities were observed (around 100 Hz). At this point it is emphasised that deviations or biases between the identiﬁed FIR and the ﬂame dynamics in experiment are quite irrelevant in the following. In the framework of the surrogate data model, the identiﬁed FIR is the true solution that needs to be recovered. An FIR model of realistic order, however, ensures values of, for example, time series length or SNR that are comparable to values that could be found when the methods are applied on LES data. For turbulent ﬂames, unsteady ﬂuctuations of the global heat release rate ˙q′ turb(t) result from turbulent ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the ﬂame front, unrelated to any excitation signal. These ﬂuctuations generate direct combustion noise. We model this effect in the present work using an FIR ﬁlter with a white noise input e(t) ˙q′ turb(t) = nc∑ i=0 cie(t − i/Delta 1 t), (4) with the nc impulse response coefﬁcients of the noise model ci. Again, the coefﬁcients of the model used to generate the surrogate data time series were determined by SI based on the LES data generated by Luis Tay-Wo-Chong. From LES data the power spectral density of the combustion noise contribution is depicted in Figure 4. The peak frequency of the spectrum is at around 150 Hz, which is in agreement with the estimation of the source spectrum of the turbulent swirl burner by Weyermann, who employed the model of Hirsch et al. The spectral distribution shown is ﬁtted by the model coefﬁcients ci in the time domain, the reference noise ﬁlter order is set to nc = 15. For further details on the determination of the noise model and its validation, the reader is referred to [ 37]. Please note, in contrast to the FIR model used for the ﬂame dynamics, i.e. the FTF, at the current state of understanding there is no fundamental justiﬁcation for the use of an FIR model for the noise term. Further studies are needed to build a better understanding of the nature of turbulent combustion noise that is based on ﬂow and combustion physics. This is beyond the scope of the present study. The only necessary requirement to obtain the results shown in Section 4 is that the noise signal is coloured. As shown in Figure 4,t h i s requirement is fulﬁlled by the model used. Altogether, in the network model used to generate the surrogate data the global heat release is modelled as ˙q′(t) = ˙q′ u′(t) + ˙q′ turb(t) = nb∑ i=0 biu′(t − i/Delta 1 t) + nc∑ i=0 cie(t − i/Delta 1 t).

Modelling of the acoustics The thermoacoustic network model employed in the present study to generate surrogate data is shown in Figure 2. The model is to represent an LES model of the burner test rig as one would use it to generate time series data for subsequent SI. Acoustic waves are assumed to be plane, as the minimal acoustic wavelength observed is much larger then the cross-sectional length of the geometry. The waves are described in terms of the characteristic wave amplitudes f = 1 ( p′ A ¯ρ ¯c + u′ A ) and g = 1 ( p′ A ¯ρ ¯c − u′ A ). (6) Here, p′ A and u′ A are the pressure and velocity ﬂuctuations, respectively, ¯ ρ is the mean density, and ¯c is the mean speed of sound. The mean ﬂow properties vary in order to account for the different cross-sectional areas and ﬂow temperature.

The indices refer to the interfaces between the elements of the network model and are deﬁned in Figure 2. The duct sections shown in Figure 2 represent a part of the annular ﬂow section downstream of the swirler, and a part of the combustion chamber, respectively. Their length is much shorter than the minimal acoustic wavelengths considered in this investigation. Therefore, all duct sections are assumed to be acoustically compact, i.e. the phase change associated with wave propagation along the duct sections is neglected. Note that, owing to the neglected duct length in the surrogate data model, the acoustic eigenfrequencies are shifted to very high values. This has the beneﬁt of avoiding possible linear instability at low frequencies caused by cavity acoustic modes. The linear model used to generate the surrogate data does not allow any conclusion on the identiﬁability of the FTF in the presence of a thermoacoustic instability. The behaviour and saturation of thermoacoustic instabilities is mainly governed by nonlinear mechanisms, which are not accounted for in the linear surrogate data model. LES models for subsequent SI often impose non-reﬂective BCs [ 44]. Thus the bound- aries of the surrogate model are assumed non-reﬂective, with the exception of Section 4.05, where the inﬂuence of the reﬂection coefﬁcient on the accuracy of SI results is explored. At the inlet, the (broadband) excitation signal is imposed as characteristic wave fex. The coupling of the ﬂame dynamics and the acoustics is implemented using the Rankine–Hugoniot equations, i.e. the linearised one-dimensional momentum and energy equations evaluated over the ﬂame [g 3 f 4 ] = 1 ζ + 1 [1 − ζ 2 θ ¯u 3 2ζζ − 1 θζ ¯u 3 ]⎡ ⎣ f 3 g 4 ˙q′ ⎤ ⎦, (8) with ζ = ¯ρ3 ¯c 3/ ¯ρ4 ¯c 4 = 2.057 and θ = ¯T 4/ ¯T 1 − 1 = 5.059. ¯T is the mean temperature.

Jaensch et al Please note that by using the Rankine–Hugoniot equations to couple ﬂame dynamics and acoustics, one includes the ITA feedback in the network model, as discussed in [ 29,33]. The ITA feedback loop is highlighted with the dashed arrows in Figure 2. In the test rig, fuel is injected such that the equivalence ratio at the ﬂame is assumed homogeneous and insensitive to acoustic ﬂuctuations. Under such conditions, the generation of entropy waves by a premixed ﬂame is of ﬁrst order in the Mach number [ 45], which is quite small. Furthermore, entropy waves couple with acoustics only in regions of strong mean ﬂow acceleration, which are absent downstream of the ﬂame. It follows that one may neglect the inﬂuence of entropy waves on the thermoacoustics of the test rig. 3. System identiﬁcation The network model discussed in the previous section is used in Section 4 to investigate the inﬂuence of ITA feedback on the results of the identiﬁcation. In the present section we introduce and discuss the SI methodology in detail. The general objective of SI methods discussed is to deduce quantitatively accurate low- order models of the frequency dependent input–output behaviour of the system under study from (broadband) time series. The input–output behaviour of a system can be characterised with the transfer function, e.g. the FTF. In this particular case the input signal is the ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity and the output signal is the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate. SI allows the FTF to be deduced over a wide range of frequencies from data generated with a single simulation run. The SI procedure comprises the following three steps. (1) Generation of broadband time series. When identifying an FTF from an LES, this means imposing a broadband excitation on the simulation and recording the result- ing ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity u′ and of the global heat release rate ˙q′. In the present study, we generate the broadband signal by running the thermoa- coustic surrogate network model, described in the previous section, in the time domain. (2) Selection of model structure with (unknown) parameters /Theta 1. Although SI relies on a ‘black box’ approach, more accurate identiﬁcation results are achieved in practice if the model structure corresponds to the physics of the system investigated. As discussed in Section 2.01, an FIR model is well suited to describe the ﬂame dynamics, which is dominated by convective processes. (3) Determination of the free parameters of the model by solving an optimisation problem. The reminder of this section discusses steps (2) and (3) in detail. Step (1) is discussed later, in Section 4. 3.01. Wiener–Hopf inversion As discussed in Section 2.01, an FIR model accounts in a natural manner for convective effects. Therefore, an FIR model structure is a plausible candidate for the identiﬁcation of ﬂame dynamics. It is given as ˆ˙q′(t, b) = ˜nb∑ i=0 ˜bi ˜u′(t − i/Delta 1 t) = ˜φ(t)T ˜b (9) Reproduction of Papers This is the authors accepted manuscript of an article published as the version of record in Combustion Theory and Modelling © Taylor & Francis https://doi.org/10.01080/13647830.02018.01443517 Combustion Theory and Modelling 621 with ˜φ(t) = [˜u′(t) ˜u′(t − /Delta 1 t) ··· ˜u′(t − ˜nb/Delta 1 t) ]T (10) ˜b = [˜b 0 ˜b 1 ··· ˜b˜nb ]T. (11) Here, ˜nb is the number of model parameters ˜bi, and ˆ˙q′ is the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate in response to the excitation as predicted by the model. This prediction depends on the parameter vector˜b and on the ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity ˜u′ resulting from the imposed excitation signal fex. Using the model ( 9) with an identiﬁed parameter vector, one can predict the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate to an arbitrary velocity ﬂuctuation. In order to determine the parameter vector˜b, the ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity ˜u′(t) imposed on the model are chosen to be identical to the measured ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity u′(t). In this case, the ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate ˆ˙q′(t) predicted by the model should be close to the measured ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate ˙q′(t). Formulated as a least squares optimisation problem, this yields min b JWHI(b) = min b N N−1∑ i=0 ( ˆ˙q′(i/Delta 1 t,b) − ˙q′(i/Delta 1 t) )2, (12) with the cost function JWHI(b). The solution of this optimisation problem, known as Wiener–Hopf inversion (WHI), is given as ˆb = ( /Phi 1 T/Phi 1 )−1 /Phi 1 TY, (13) with φ(t) = [ u′(t) u′(t − /Delta 1 t) ··· u′(t − ˜nb/Delta 1 t) ]T (14) /Phi 1= [φ(0) φ(/Delta 1 t) ··· φ(N/Delta 1 t)]T (15) Y = [˙q′(0) ˙q′(/Delta 1 t) ··· ˙q′(N/Delta 1 t) ]T. (16) Please note that the number of parameters ˜nb has also to be determined. When identifying the FTF, as in the present study, the length can be calculated via the physical time delay of the ﬂame impulse response τ according to Equation ( 3). Therefore, we choose ˜nb = nb = 30. /Phi 1 T/Phi 1 is the auto-correlation matrix of the input signal, i.e. the ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity in the present case. As this matrix has to be inverted, it has to have full rank. This can be ensured by choosing an uncorrelated input signal. In the present study this requirement is fulﬁlled, as the input signal is a white noise signal. F ¨oller and Polifke [ 46] proposed a general method for generating input signals for the LES/SI approach. In order to assess the properties of the WHI, we now assume that the time series used for the identiﬁcation were generated with an FIR model. This FIR model has a set of actual parameters b*. Consequently, it is assumed that the measured ﬂuctuation of the global heat release rate ˙q′(t) is given as ˙q′(t) = ˆ˙q′(t, b∗) + ν(t) = φ(t)b∗ + ν(t). (17) A.2 P APER -SI FTF, Combust. Theor.

The WHI is a good estimator if the estimated parameter vector ˆb is close to the vector b* of actual parameters.

The pa- rameter vector identiﬁed ˆb is a good estimate to the actual parameter vector b∗ as long as /Phi 1 T/Xi 1≈ 0. (20) holds. Under open-loop conditions, the input and noise signals are uncorrelated and this requirement is fulﬁlled. In closed-loop conditions, however, the feedback results in a cor- relation between input and noise. The term /Phi 1 T/Xi 1 will thus not vanish – even in the case of inﬁnitely long time series. In this case, WHI will give a biased estimate of b, which depends on both the kind of feedback and the properties of the noise. Note that this shortcoming of the WHI method is crucial in the context of the present study. Please recall that, when deducing an FTF from compressible LES, two feedback mech- anisms are present: (1) feedback due to reﬂections at the boundary conditions; and (2) ITA feedback. The former can be avoided via non-reﬂective BCs (see [ 44]). The ITA feedback, however, cannot be avoided. As a consequence of this feedback the combustion noise creates ﬂuctuations of the reference velocity. These ﬂuctuations can be considered as additional input signal. Hence, the input signal is correlated with the noise signal and the term /Phi 1 T/Xi 1 will not vanish. Therefore, the WHI will always yield a biased estimate of the FTF. The question remaining is how large this bias is. This will be discussed in Section 4. But ﬁrst, we introduce an advanced SI method based on the BJ model structure. This method yields unbiased estimates even if feedback is present. 3.02. From Wiener–Hopf inversion to Box–Jenkins identiﬁcation WHI uses an FIR model to describe the ﬂame dynamics. As discussed in Section 2.01,t h i s accounts for the physical effects dominating the response of the ﬂame to a ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity. However, the inﬂuence of the turbulent combustion noise is neglected. In contrast to the FIR model, a BJ model can account for this effect. As we will demonstrate in Section 4, this allows an unbiased estimate of the FTF to be obtained, even in the presence of feedback. Additionally, one obtains a model for the turbulent combustion noise.

The polynomials B(z), F(z), C(z), and D(z) are also called ﬁlters. The fundamental difference between the ﬁlters is that B(z) and C(z) relate prior inputs (u′(t)z−1) and prior disturbances ( e(t)z−1) to the current estimated output ( ˆq′(t)), whereas the ﬁlters F(z) and D(z) relate prior outputs ( ˆq′(t)z−i) to the current output and thus describe possible auto-regressive system behaviour. The BJ model is the most general linear model. If the orders ˜nb, ˜nf, ˜nc, and ˜nd of the ﬁlters are sufﬁciently large, it can represent any linear model. The limiting factor, besides numerical issues, is that high ﬁlter orders yield a large number of parameters. Consequently, long time series are necessary to identify these parameters accurately. The results of the identiﬁcation can be signiﬁcantly improved by a proper choice of the ﬁlter orders. Comparing the BJ model structure shown in (21) and the model structure of the reference model ( 5), it becomes evident that the general BJ structure is more complex than the reference model describing the ﬂame dynamics inside the network model. The reference model structure does not contain the auto-regressive ﬁlters F(z) and D(z). Thus, in this study the general BJ model structure can be simpliﬁed, before estimating the parameter vector /Theta 1 by choosing F(z) = D(z) = 1, (23) which yields ˆ˙q′(t) = B(z)u′(t) + C(z)e(t). (24) Now, the model structure is equivalent to the model describing the ﬂame dynamics ( 5) and includes a model for the turbulent combustion noise. As for the WHI, the order ˜nb of the ﬁlter B(z) is determined via Equation ( 3) using the convective time lags describing the ﬂame dynamics. As discussed in Section 2.01, within the current state of the art, relations for determining the ﬁlter orders of the noise model analytically are not known. However, there exist general methods like residual analysis, cross validation, or Akaike’ s information criterion (AIC) [ 47] for deducing the model structure from the time series (see e.g. [ 13,48]). These methods allow the order ˜nc of the ﬁlter C(z) to be determined in a general way. For the purpose of the present work we choose ˜nc = nc. After having determined a suitable model structure, the next step within the SI method- ology is to determine the entries of the vector of unknown parameters /Theta 1. Again, the key idea A.2 P APER -SI FTF, Combust. Theor. Model.

Jaensch et al is to formulate a least squares optimisation problem that minimises the difference between the output of the model identiﬁed and the time series data used for the identiﬁcation. For the BJ model, additional difﬁculty arises when estimating the noise. The problem is that the noise input e(t) is not known. One possible solution to this problem is the use of so-called one-step-ahead prediction: ˆ˙′q(t|t − /Delta 1 t, /Theta 1) = D(z) C(z) B(z) F(z)u′(t) + C(z) − D(z) C(z) ˙q′(t) (25) or with ( 23) ˆ˙′q(t|t − /Delta 1 t, /Theta 1) = B(z) C(z)u′(t) + C(z) − 1 C(z) ˙q′(t), (26) where u′(t) and ˙q′(t) are the measured ﬂuctuations of the velocity and of the global heat release rate, respectively. It is emphasised that the output of the one-step-ahead prediction ˆ˙q′(t|t − /Delta 1 t, /Theta 1) is now also dependent on the output time series ˙q′(t). This means that the output of the BJ model has been calculated based on all information that was available at the previous time step t − /Delta 1 t. The one-step-ahead predictor exploits the noise model to improve the prediction of the model output at the next time step. Please note that for C(z) = 1 the BJ model ( 24) reduces to an FIR model. In this case, the corresponding one-step-ahead predictor ( 26) becomes also an FIR model and the prediction cannot be improved by this means. This is because the noise considered by an FIR model is uncorrelated. The essential difference between an FIR model estimation and, for example, a BJ model estimation, is that as soon as C(z) ̸=1 o r D(z) ̸=1 the noise contribution v(t) = C(z)/D(z) e(t) is coloured and is no longer Gaussian white noise. Consequently, it does not correlate out and has to be taken into account, which needs an estimation of the coloured noise termv(t). This is not the case for an FIR model estimation. The one-step-ahead predictor exploits the correlation of the noise. A BJ model describes this correlation via the noise model. Using ( 26), the output of the model can be determined as both input signals u′(t) and ˙q′(t) are known. Therefore, we can formulate an optimisation problem for determining the unknown parameters /Theta 1 of both the FTF and the noise model of the BJ structure: min /Theta 1 JPEM(/Theta 1) = min /Theta 1 N N−1∑ i=0 ( ˆ˙q′(i/Delta 1 t|(i − 1)/Delta 1 t, /Theta 1) − ˙q′(i/Delta 1 t) )2. (27) In contrast to WHI, this optimisation problem is nonlinear. In [ 49], Wills and Ninness discuss efﬁcient algorithms for this problem. The method for determining the unknown parameters of a BJ model described in the present section is known as the Prediction Error Method (PEM). It can be shown that the method yields an unbiased estimate [ 15]. This means that, if the data were generated with an actual BJ model, the parameters predicted via the PEM converge to the parameters of the actual model for long time series lengths. This holds as long as the noise is modelled correctly, which can always be fulﬁlled by using a noise model with a high number of parameters. However, a high number of parameters can only be identiﬁed accurately with long time series and consequently long LES runs. Therefore, one should try to ﬁnd the minimal number of parameters necessary to obtain a good model. Here again, techniques like residual analysis, cross-validation, or Akaike’ s information criterion (AIC) [ 47] can be used.

In order to evaluate the quality of the identiﬁed models, we ﬁrst generate surrogate data using a network model. Afterwards, SI is performed and the FTF identiﬁed is compared against the FTF used in the network model. 3.03. Regularisation of the identiﬁcation As LES is computationally expensive, the lengths of the time series used for the LES/SI approach are typically very short. If only short time series are available, SI is prone to over- ﬁtting, which results in a poor estimate of the FTF. Regularisation can be used to prevent over-ﬁtting and to improve the results for short time series. The idea is to add constraints by modifying the cost function of the optimisation problem: Jreg(/Theta 1) = J(/Theta 1) + λ/Theta 1 TR/Theta 1. (28) In general, the function J(/Theta 1) can be JWHI(/Theta 1)o r JPEM(/Theta 1). Within the scope of the present case study, we investigate only the regularised WHI, i.e. J(/Theta 1) = JWHI(/Theta 1). R is the regular- isation matrix and λ the regularisation parameter. In the literature, λR is often called the ‘kernel’. A suitable choice of these variables allows additional information to be used for the identiﬁcation. This allows an accurate estimation of the FTF to be obtained, even if only short time series are available. The key idea is to assume that the impulse response should be smooth and decay exponentially [ 50]. In Section 4, the so-called Tuned and Correlated (TC) kernel is used. For a detailed discussion on how the regularisation parameters can be determined, we refer the reader to [ 50–52]. 4. Numerical examples In the present section, we analyse how the intrinsic feedback inﬂuences the identiﬁcation of the FTF. The general procedure is shown in Figure 5. First, surrogate data is generated by simulating the network model described in Section 2 in the time domain. Thereafter, the FTF is identiﬁed with the methods discussed in Section 3. Finally, the FTF identiﬁed is compared to the actual FTF used to generate the data. 4.01. Generation of surrogate data and Monte Carlo simulation In order to generate the surrogate data, the network model is simulated in the time domain.

This results in a state-space model describing the whole network model: xk+1 = Axk + B [fex(k/Delta 1 t) e(k/Delta 1 t) ] (29 a) [u′(k/Delta 1 t) ˙q′(k/Delta 1 t) ] = Cxk + D [fex(k/Delta 1 t) e(k/Delta 1 t) ], (29 b) with time step /Delta 1 t and time increment k. The matrices A, B, C, and D are the state-space matrices. These matrices were obtained with the thermoacoustic network code ta X [ 6,53] developed at the Technical University of Munich. The vector xk is the state vector. The ﬂuctuation of the reference velocity u′ and of the global heat release rate ˙q′ are the output signals of the network model. As shown in Figure 2, fex is the ingoing wave at the inlet of the domain. It represents the external forcing. This signal is a pseudo random binary signal. The signal e(t) models the turbulent noise source. Hence, e(t)i sm o d e l l e da sarandom Gaussian distributed white noise signal. Owing to this random signal, several evaluations of the network model yield different output time series. This is also an essential characteristic of an LES: owing to turbulence, multiple LES runs with slightly different initial conditions will always yield different time series. The results of the LES/SI approach are affected by this randomness. By chance, one can get a better or a worse model. In the present study we quantify this uncertainty using a Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, for each set of parameters investigated, the network model is evaluated several times. Owing to the random signal e(t), each evaluation yields different time series, and hence a different FTF is identiﬁed. In Figures 6, 8, and 10,t h e results of the Monte Carlo simulation are shown in terms of mean values and standard deviation. For these plots, the network model was evaluated 100 times. 4.02. Calculation of the error The advantage of using surrogate data is that the actual FTF is known and can be used as reference.

The exponent ‘H’ denotes the complex conjugate. This error deﬁnition measures the error in the frequency domain. All frequencies are equally weighted. This error measure should be interpreted qualitatively. The absolute error made by the different SI methods is discussed in Section 4.06. 4.03. Identiﬁcation in the limit of inﬁnite time series length As discussed in Section 3, under closed-loop conditions WHI, in contrast to the PEM with a BJ model, yields a biased estimate of the FTF. This means the FTF identiﬁed does not converge towards the actual FTF even in the limit of inﬁnite time series length. In Figure 6, the error (see Equation 30) is plotted over the length of the time series used for the identiﬁcation. The latter is normalised by the impulse response length as deﬁned in Equation ( 2). The excitation amplitude was ﬁxed to A = 10%. Indeed, for very long time series the error made by the BJ identiﬁcation is signiﬁcantly smaller compared to the error made by WHI and the regularised WHI. However, when LES data is analysed the length of the time series available is typically smaller than 30 τ. In this data range the conﬁdence intervals of all methods overlap and hence, by chance any of the methods can yield the best estimate of the FTF. On average, the regularised WHI yields the best estimate. This is expected as the method is designed for short time series. The BJ identiﬁcation becomes better than the regularised WHI estimate for time series longer than about 20 τ. The classical WHI is inferior for any time series length, and hence should be avoided. In order to provide a better understanding of the overall error shown in Figure 6 and to give an idea of the accuracy of the identiﬁed FTF, Figure 7 depicts a few samples of the Monte Carlo set of identiﬁed FTFs. Ten exemplary results from the WHI identiﬁcation are shown and compared against the actual FTFs for different data lengths. It can be observed that, for the shorter data set lengths, the spread of the respectively identiﬁed models is rather large even if the general trend of the actual FTFs is still matched. In the case of a distinctively longer time series, the identiﬁed models converge to a single, but slightly biased, solution. A.2 P APER -SI FTF, Combust. Theor. Model.

Dependency on signal-to-noise-ratio and excitation amplitude The dependence of models identiﬁed with a certain excitation amplitude A is shown in Figure 8. Here, the excitation amplitude A is the amplitude of the wave fex. The time series for this plot were 30 τ, which corresponds to the amount of data typically available for the LES/SI approach. For all identiﬁcation methods, the error decays with the amplitude. This strong decay of ϵ with increasing forcing amplitude may be attributed to the decreasing inﬂuence of the noise contribution, which impedes an accurate identiﬁcation. Note that an increased SNR does not necessarily reduce the bias in the WHI method caused by the closed-loop ITA feedback. Hence, when applying the LES/SI approach to real data, the forcing amplitude should be chosen as high as possible. The limiting factor is the triggering of nonlinear effects by high excitation amplitudes. As the network model used in the present study is linear, it does not account for this limit. If data is generated via LES, the ﬂame responds linearly for amplitudes lower than about 10%. At this amplitude level, the error made by all methods investigated is comparable. The BJ identiﬁcation is superior for very low amplitudes. Thus, this method should be used for ﬂames that are prone to nonlinearities or ﬂames that exhibit a strong noise contribution. A better understanding of this behaviour of the LES/SI approach can be obtained by looking at the SNR. It is deﬁned as SNR = RMS( ˙q′ u′) RMS( ˙q′ turb). (32) Here, ˙q′ u′ describes the heat release rate ﬂuctuations resulting purely from the acoustic forcing. It is determined by simulating the network model in the time domain with a noise signal equal to zero.˙q′ turb is equal to the variance of pure noise. In Figure 9, de- pendency of the SNR on the forcing amplitude is shown. It becomes evident that a small increase in the excitation amplitude increases SNR over-proportionally. This yields the signiﬁcant decrease of the error made by the identiﬁcation when the forcing amplitude is increased.

Dependence of the SNR on the excitation amplitude. 4.05. The inﬂuence of reﬂections at the boundaries As discussed above, in a compressible LES the following two acoustic feedback mechanisms can be present. (1) The intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback (see Figure 1 ). This feedback is always present and cannot be avoided. (2) Feedback due to reﬂections at the BCs. Non-reﬂective BCs, as proposed by Polifke, Wall, and Moin [ 44], can suppress this feedback. In many LES codes, however, only Navier–Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBCs) [ 54] are available. These BCs reﬂect acoustic waves according to a low-pass ﬁlter R(ω) = ˆgd ˆfd = −1 1 + iω 2 σ = −1 1 + iω 1 fc, (33) with the angular frequency ω and the cut-off frequency fc. The hat (ˆ·) labels variables in the frequency domain. σ is the relaxation parameter. A relaxation parameter equal to zero yields perfectly non-reﬂective boundary conditions. However, this choice results in a drift of the mean ﬂow variables. Thus, it is necessary to choose σ> 0 for practical applications. This avoids the drift at the cost of reﬂections according to Equation ( 33). In order to investigate the inﬂuence of these reﬂections on the LES/SI approach, the network model shown in Figure 2 was modiﬁed. Instead of the non-reﬂective inﬂow and outﬂow BCs, used for the studies discussed in the previous sections, a low-pass ﬁlter according to Equation (33) was applied. In Figure 10, the dependency of the results of the LES/SI approach on the cut-off frequency fc of this ﬁlter is shown. A high cut-off frequency corresponds to a large value of the relaxation parameter. Up to a cut-off frequency of 750 Hz, only a small inﬂuence of the relaxation parameter on the model identiﬁed is observed. For a cut-off frequency of 750 Hz and above (not shown here) the error suddenly increases. For these values the thermoacoustic network model is linearly unstable. This means that the amplitude of the instability grows inﬁnitely in the generated time series as amplitude saturation is governed by nonlinear mechanisms, which are not captured by the linearsurrogate data model. The linear unstable mode here can be attributed to the ITA mode of the BRS burner [ 36,37], which is independent of the duct length used and is thus not suppressed by using compact duct sections in the surrogate data model. An accurate identiﬁcation from the surrogate data model is not possible any more. In the range of stable working conditions (up to a cut-off frequency of 750 Hz), reﬂect- ing boundary conditions enhance the ﬂame’ s inherent intrinsic feedback-loop feedback.

This enhanced coupling manifests itself in an ampliﬁcation of the ITA frequency within the generated time series. Meaning that although the external forcing signal fex is a pure broadband signal (a pseudo random binary signal), the input ( u′) and output ( ˙q′) signals exhibit a dominant frequency, which is equal to the ITA frequency. Nonetheless, the error ϵ hardly increases with an increasing reﬂection at the boundaries and is thus comparably small. Therefore, we conclude that the reason why non-reﬂective BCs are helpful for the identiﬁcation is that they promote the thermoacoustic stability of the LES. As long as the simulation stays thermoacoustically stable the LES/SI approach works also with NSCBC. This simpliﬁes the application of the LES/SI approach signiﬁcantly. 4.06. Application to LES data The H 2-norm used in the previous sections, see Equation ( 30), allows only a statement on the global error made by the identiﬁed models, i.e. a summary over all frequencies. Moreover, the magnitude of the absolute value of the error made is difﬁcult to interpret in terms of agreement to thetrue solution. Therefore, in this section the identiﬁed models are compared over the frequency range in order to provide a more immediate insight into the accuracy of the identiﬁed models. For this we apply the methods to the LES data discussed in [ 22]. The intention of using actual LES data here instead of a surrogate dataset is that, for LES generated data, certain restrictions are given. For example the time series length affordable is limited or the SNR cannot be increased arbitrarily in order to avoid a nonlinear ﬂame response. Moreover, the surrogate data relies on certain assumptions such as a pre-deﬁned noise distribution or the acoustic compactness of the enclosing cavity. These assumptions may be dropped when using actual LES data and the performance of the different identiﬁcation methods can be compared for a real application. The results are shown in Figure 11. Please note that the FTF from WHI identiﬁcation is identical to the one shown in Figure 3, since the same LES data set was used for the identiﬁcation. The difference between the methods is negligible. As it turns out, even if theoretically the BJ model provides unbiased estimations for the FTF in the case of very long time series, the identiﬁcation error introduced by the ﬁnite LES time series length dominates. Therefore, all three methods yield similar results. Thus, although the WHI Reproduction of Papers This is the authors accepted manuscript of an article published as the version of record in Combustion Theory and Modelling © Taylor & Francis https://doi.org/10.01080/13647830.02018.01443517 Combustion Theory and Modelling 631 0.05 1.05 ∥FTF(f)∥ 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 −15 −10 −5 f [Hz] ∠FTF(f) Figure 11.

Conclusion The Large Eddy Simulation/System Identiﬁcation (LES/SI) approach is an efﬁcient method for determining a ﬂame transfer function (FTF) numerically. We have demonstrated that, due to Intrinsic Thermo Acoustic (ITA) feedback, Wiener–Hopf Inversion (WHI), which is the SI method most frequently applied, yields a biased estimate of the FTF. Fortunately, the bias error becomes small for medium excitation amplitudes. This is the reason why the WHI works well in many applications. Furthermore, our analyses have shown that the model identiﬁed is inﬂuenced by reﬂec- tions at the boundary conditions, but the error introduced by the enhanced coupling due to reﬂective boundary conditions is comparably small. Hence, non-reﬂective boundary con- ditions are not essentially needed for the LES/SI approach. This increases the applicability of the approach signiﬁcantly, as it allows the method to be applied independently of the LES solvers used. Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Dr. L.

Introduction In various industrial applications, e.g. gas turbines for powergeneration or propulsion, combustion noise is an undesirable, but unavoidableby-productofturbulent combustion.In aeronauticalengines combustionnoisemaydominatethe sound emis- sions within a certain frequency range. Besides being harmful for those continuously exposed to noise emissions, elevated combustion noise levels may even trigger thermoacoustic instabilities, which should be avoided at any cost. Consequently, combustionnoise is a subject of pastas well as on-going research. * Corresponding author.

Akaike’s Information Criterion PEM Prediction Error Method SNR Signal-to-Noise Ratio WHI Wiener-Hopf Inversion In any effort to reduce or limit sound emissions from turbulent combustiondevices, two aspectsare highly relevant: Firstly, a detailed understanding and characterization of the combustion noise source is essential. Secondly, an accurate and ﬂexible prediction tool for estimating the spectral sound pressure distribution is needed in order to develop and assess suitable coun- termeasures. In this context ‘ﬂexible’ means that changes in the geometry and acoustic reﬂection conditions of the setup, as well as changes in the noise source itself are quickly realizable. If this is the case, predictions of the spectral sound pressure distributionarepossibleacross a large parameterspace. Over the last decades a multitude of studies were conducted to develop a deeper understanding of the generation of com- bustion noise and the noise source characteristics of a turbulent ﬂame. Bragg stated that a turbulent ﬂame behaves like a set of monopole sources. Reﬁning Bragg’s theory and making use of Lighthill’s analogy, Strahle derived a formulation of the far ﬁeld pressure for a region that encompasses a turbulent ﬂame. This formulation related the ﬂuctuations of acoustic pressure in the far ﬁeld to those of unsteady heat release within the ﬂame region. More recent work on the determination of the combustion noise source and its spectral distribution was conducted by Clavin and Siggia, who analytically predicted a spectral decay of combustion noise scaling asf−2.05.H i r s c het ala n d W ä s l eet al provided a quantitative closure for the spectral distribution of heat release in turbulent premixed combustion that is based on local, time-mean values of heat release rate, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence lengthscale. The closure proposed by Hirschet ala n d W ä s l eet alw a s conﬁrmed by Rajaram and Lieuwen, who measured the noise source spectra emitted from a turbulent open jet ﬂame for a variety of operating conditions. Once the noise source is characterized, the next step is to predict the spectral distribution of sound pressure levels. In this context, there is an essential difference between open and conﬁned conﬁgurations. For open conﬁgurations the inﬂuence of the ﬂame on the acoustics is strong, but notvice versa. In this scenario of ‘one-way coupling’, the spectral distribution of sound pressure is strongly correlated to that of the combustion noise source. Only open conﬁgurations with pronounced intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback mayreveal distinct peaks in their sound pressure spectrum. For conﬁned conﬁgurations, on the other hand, acoustic reﬂections at the conﬁnement boundary can establish a ‘two-way coupling’ between ﬂame and acoustics [11–13]. The acoustic ﬁeld of the enclosing cavity is excited by the broad-band combus- tion noise source and resonances at the acoustic eigenfrequencies may develop. This results in a spectral distribution of sound pressurethat depends strongly onthe acousticproperties ofthe enclosing cavityand maydiffer distinctlyfrom the combustion noise source spectrum. Therefore, a correct description of the ﬂame and the combustion noise source is not enough to pre- dict the resulting spectral sound pressure distribution for conﬁned conﬁgurations. An accurate acoustic characterization of the conﬁnement cavity is crucially needed as well. Asalmosteverycombustiondeviceofappliedinterestisconﬁn ed,thecorrespondingpossiblepredictionapproachesshallbe further examined. Experimental measurements of a certain conﬁguration represent the most straightforward approach. How- Reproduction of Papers With permission from M. Merk, S. Jaensch, C.Silva, and W. Polifke. Simultaneous identiﬁcation of transfer functions and combustion noise of a turbulent ﬂame. Journal of Sound and Vibration, 422, Elsevier, 2018. M. Merk etal. / Journal of Sound and Vibration 422432–452434 ever, experimental measurements are laborious and rather inﬂexible if it comes to changes in the acoustic boundaries or the conﬁnement geometry. Numerically, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has shown to be capable in resolving the combustion noise generation, as it captures all physically relevant mechanisms. Silvaet al and Kingset al predicted qualitatively cor- rect the sound pressure spectra in conﬁned combustion setups, whereas Merket al achieved quantitatively agreement with experimentally measured sound pressurespectra. Although LESallows quick changes in thecharacteristics of the acoustic boundaries or the surrounding conﬁnement, it is computationally expensive. A study across a large parameter space is hardly affordable. Another very ﬂexibleandcomputationallymoreeﬃcient predictionapproachis basedontheuseofa linearacousticmodels such as linear network models or more complex formulations that describe the acoustic wave propagation within complex geometries [14,17–20]. Compared to the use of a compressible LES, which resolves the noise generation as well as the acoustic propagation directly, the key idea of using linear acoustic models is to decouple the noise source from the acoustic propagation. By providing a model for the noise source, linear acoustic models are then capable of predicting qualitatively and quantitatively correct sound pressure spectra e.g. of a conﬁned turbulent swirl combustor. However, Silvaet al showed thatdueto atwo-way couplingbetween ﬂameand acousticsthere aresituations,in which themereincorporation of a noise source is not enough to predict the sound pressure spectra correctly. In addition, a model for the ﬂame dynamics, i.e. the ﬂame transfer function (FTF), is needed for correct sound pressure predictions. The attractiveness of the linear acoustic model approach consists mainly in its ﬂexibility as well as in its computational eﬃciency. Changes in the geometry of the setup or its acoustic boundaries can be realized quickly by changing the properties o ft h er e s p e c t i v ee l e m e n ti nt h el i n e a ra c o u s t i cm o d e l.C h a n ges in the source characteristics or the ﬂame dynamics can be implemented by replacing the respective model. This allows parameter studies across a large parameter space with reasonable effort and provides thus a suitable tool for predicting sound pressure levels in conﬁned setups. 2. Objectives and scope of the work Asexplainedin theprevioussection,the FTFandarespectivenoisemodelarethekeyfeaturesofalinear acousticmodelthat is used for sound pressure level predictions. These models relyon the assumption that the totalheat release rate ﬂuctuation ̇Q′ sum, which is responsible for the sound generation across a turbulent ﬂame, can be distinguished into two contributions, see Fig. 1. 1) A deterministic parṫQ′ c described by the FTF. For premixed ﬂames this part relates incoming acoustic velocity ﬂuctuations u′ ac to the deterministic heat release rate ﬂuctuationṡQ′ c. 2) A stochastic contributioṅQ′ s representing the stochastic heat release rate ﬂuctuations that are caused by turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations impinging on the ﬂame front. This contribution should be, by deﬁnition, uncorrelated to any acoustic forcing. It can be described by a noise model, which ﬁlters a Gaussian white noise signal and outputs a colored noise signal that match the noise source characteristics of the ﬂame, see Fig. 1. The summationof thesetwo contributionṡQ′ sum is fed into the linear network model,where it is related to the generated acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations. So essential for a correct estimation of the sound pressure spectrum by a linear acoustic model are accurate models for the FTF and the respective noise model. Therefore, the focus of the current work is not yet laid onthepredictionofsoundpressurespectrabasedonlinearacou sticmodels,butone stepbefore:The accuratedeterminationof FTF and noise model. Polifkeandco-workers[ 22]introducedamethodtoextracta FTFbycombining LESwith System Identiﬁcation(SI)techniques.In LES the ﬂame is excited by an acoustic velocity ﬂuctuationu′ ac with a broad-band spectral distribution. The resulting total heat release rate ﬂuctuatioṅQ′ sum is measured. From this discrete input-output time series the FTF can be modeled as a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model structure by correlation analysis and SI methods. In the current work the proposed LES/SI approach shall be extended by further pursuing the identiﬁcation techniques and model structures introduced into the ﬁeld of thermo- and aero-acousticsby Jaenschetal. and Sovardi etal.respectively.Insteadofonly identifying a FTF, advanced SI techniques allowthe simultaneousestimationofa combustionnoisemodelfrom the samediscretebroad-bandinput-output time series.

The overallgoalofthe current work istoinvestigateidentiﬁab ilityandqualityassessmentofmodelstructuresthatallowthe description of the deterministic parṫQ′ c and the stochastic parṫQ′ s. Attention is paid particularly to the estimated noise models as the identiﬁcation of the FTF received already notice. However, it is emphasized that the noise model estimation always comes with a simultaneous identiﬁcation of a FTF and cannot be isolated. It is then studied how the noise model quality of different model structures depends on certain properties of the used input-output time series, such as time series length and signal-to-noise ratio. Since a surrogate data model is used in this study to generate the time series, the reference FTF and noise model are knownap r i o r i. This offers a straightforward assessment of the identiﬁed model quality by comparing it against the reference model, which represents thetrue solution. As thetrue solution is normally not known when models are identiﬁed on the basis of LES data, an additional objective is to provide concepts allowing to draw conclusions on the identiﬁed model quality. Especially the determination of the most suitable model order is of high relevance for the applicationof SI methods on LES generated input-output time series. The organization of the paper is as follows: In Section 3 the necessary SI theory is covered and the investigated model structures are introduced. In Section 4 the surrogate data model structure is explained along with its advantages regarding the current study, whereas the criteria of model quality assessment are shown in Section 5. Results of the respective identiﬁcation for different model structures are presented in Section 6.01. Model order and quality is assessedin Section 6.02. 3.

Keesmandescribesthe overall objectiveof SI as‘theconstruction ofmathematicalmodelsofthe systemunderstudybased onnoisytimeseries’.The mathematicalmodels,usuallyreferred toastransfer functions, shouldcorrectlydescribetheobserved input-output behavior of the system and thus its dynamics. Inthe herein considered framework of thermoacoustics, the FTF is a transfer function that treats acoustic velocity ﬂuctuationsu′ as input signal and relates it to heat release rate ﬂuctuations ̇Q′ as output signal. Therefore, the notation ofu′ as input anḋQ′ as output signal is kept throughout the following sections. A single-input single-output system is generally described by ̇Q′(t)= G·u′(t)+ H ·e(t) (1) here G refers to a polynomial transfer function of the ‘plant’ model that describes the deterministic part of the model. It estab- lishes a causal relation between the inputu′(t)and the outpuṫQ′(t). H is a polynomial transfer function relating a white noise terme(t)tothe output ̇Q′(t)andmodelingthusthestochasticpartofthemodeloutput.However, intheframeworkofthermoa- coustics Hwouldcorrespond toanoisemodelthatmimicsthecontribut ion ofturbulent combustionnoiseon theoveralloutput ̇Q′(t)and should not be mistaken as a sort of measurement noise that corrupts the measured output signal.H provides the con- tribution ̇Q′ s, which is physically related to combustion noise generated by turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations. Note that incoming turbulent velocityﬂuctuations thatimpinge ona ﬂamefront andcause stochasticheat release rate ﬂuctuationṡQ′ s are generally colored and not white. Yet, the noise model H uses by deﬁnition a white noise input term, from which every desired spectral distribution of ̇Q′ s can be directly obtained by ﬁltering the generic white noise input terme(t) through the noise model H.S o the noise model H mimics the effect of colored velocity ﬂuctuationsthat cause a certain spectral distribution oḟQ′ s, by shaping thesamestochasticcontributionfrom ageneric whitenoiseinput.Itcontainsthus physicalinformationofthesystem.Recalling Fig.1,theplantmodel Gcanbeassignedto the FTFproviding ̇Q′ c whereas the polynomialtransfer function H correspondsto the noise model with its outpuṫQ′ s. The SI procedure can be generally summarized in three steps. First, a broad-band time series withu′(t)asinput and ̇Q′(t)as outputisgenerated.Next,aspeciﬁcmodelstructurefor Gand Hischosen,suitablefordescribingthephysicsofthesystemunder study. Last, depending on the model structure selected, the model coeﬃcients of G and H are estimated within an optimization problem. The generation of input-output time series by means of a surrogate data model is explained in Section 4.T h el a s tt w o steps constitute the core of the SI procedure and are covered within the remainder of this section. Possible model structures and their characteristics are addressed in the followingsubsection 3.01. The estimation of the polynomial model coeﬃcients is described insubsection 3.02. 3.01. Model structure The mostgeneral structure of a rationalpolynomialmodelreads as A(q,𝛉) ̇Q′(t,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉) F(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ C(q,𝛉) D(q,𝛉)e(t) (2) From this general formulation speciﬁc model structures may be derived by including or excluding the respective polynomial ﬁlters A,B,C,D and F. Accordingly, the different models vary in ﬂexibility and modeling level of the deterministic and noise characteristics.Theones used inthe current studyare addressedinsubsections 3.01.01–3.01.03.But ﬁrstsome remarks are madeon Reproduction of Papers With permission from M.

(1)and Fig.1 it becomes evident that the polynomial ﬁlters B(q,𝛉)∕F(q,𝛉)describe the plant model G whereas C(q,𝛉)∕D(q,𝛉) specify the noise model H. The polynomialﬁlters herein are expressed in terms of the time shift operatorq−i deﬁned as q−iu′(t)= u′(t −iΔt) (3) yielding for the polynomialﬁlters A,B,C,D and F A(q)= 1+a 1 q−1 +a 2 q−2 …anaq−na B(q)= b 0 +b 1 q−1 +b 2 q−2 …bnbq−nb C(q)= 1+c 1 q−1 +c 2 q−2 …cncq−nc D(q)= 1+d 1 q−1 +d 2 q−2 …dndq−nd F(q)= 1+f 1 q−1 +f 2 q−2 …fnf q−nf The polynomialmodel coeﬃcients are summarized in the parametervector𝛉 𝛉 ={ a 1 …ana,b 0 …bnb,c 1 …cnc,d 1 …dnd,f 1 …fnf }, which is later estimated during the model coeﬃcient estimation process described in Section 3.02. So inserting the polynomial ﬁlters into Eq.(2) the output ̇Q′(t,𝛉) results from a convolution of the respective polynomial model coeﬃcients contained in𝛉 with present andpast inputs orwhite noise disturbances.The values{na,nb,nc,nd,nf}specify the polynomialmodel order and deﬁne how much prior input samples and stochastic disturbance samples are taken into account by the respective polynomial ﬁlterfortheconvolution.Explicitlymodelingthestochasticdi sturbancesbytreatingthemasanoutputofalinearsystemdriven by white noise, does not only provide valuable information on the noise source itself. It also improves the identiﬁcation of the plant model,if the identiﬁcationprocess relies on noisy data. Whereas the polynomial ﬁlters Band C relate prior inputsq−iu′(t)and prior disturbancesq−ie(t)to the current outpuṫQ′(t), respectively,the polynomialﬁlters A,D and F relate former outputsq−i ̇Q′(t)tothe current output ̇Q′(t).A,D and F describethus auto-regressivecharacteristicsinthedynamicsofthesystem.Prioroutputshaveanimpactonthecurrentone,henceaninternal feedback mechanism is established. The difference between the polynomial ﬁlter A on the one hand and the two ﬁlters{F,D} on the other hand is that A speciﬁes poles that are shared by both the plant model as well as the noise model. This modeling approach is physics-wise reasonable when the disturbances enter the system already at the input and exhibit therefore the samedynamicsas theplant model. Inturn the polynomialﬁlters F and Dare independent and describe polesthat are unique to the plant model and the noise model, respectively. From apractical point of view either a common polynomial ﬁlter A for the plant model G(q,𝛉)and the noise model H(q,𝛉)is used ortwo unique polynomial ﬁlters F and D. Generally, the least complex model structure that is able to suﬃciently describe the system’s dynamics is regarded as the mostsuitableone.However,inthe LES/SIapproachforthermoaco ustics,thechoiceofthemostsuitablemodelstructuredepends on the speciﬁc application and is still topic of ongoing research. Is a noise model needed? Should auto-regressive feedback be taken into account? If the model structure is too simple, abiased estimate results from the identiﬁcation process.Bias means that asystematic error is made, since the selected model structure is not able to capture all relevant dynamics of the system under study.A second unknown in the SIprocedure is the correct order of the polynomialﬁlters.Assuming the modelstructure is chosen correctly, a model having a very small order may not be ﬂexible enough to describe the system’s behavior with a certain accuracy.Increasing the model order often increases its ﬂexibility, meaning that the model error made decreases. Yet, if more modelcoeﬃcientsneed tobeestimatedduetoanincreasedmodelorder,the modelcoeﬃcient varianceisalsoincreasing. Al a r g evariance decreases the model’s robustness. Ityields excellent results on the training data set, which is the data set used for the identiﬁcation.However, the prediction of the output basedon a new dataset, the so-called test dataset, would fail. This behavior is known asover-ﬁtting and is explained in more detail in Section 5. To investigate the mentioned uncertainties in the SI procedure, three different model structures of varying complexity are investigated in detail and tested in regard to their suitability in the presence of noise. The model structure complexity ranges from the most simple FIR model (subsection 3.01.01) over an intermediately complex Auto-regressive Exogenous (ARX) model (subsection 3.01.02) to the rather complex Box-Jenkins (BJ) model structure (subsection 3.01.03). The choice of these tested model structuresisrelatedtotheworkof Jaensch etal.whoinvestigatedonlythe FTFmodelqua lityfordifferentmodelstructures in the presence of noise and internal feedback. Yet, in the current study the focus is laid on the noise model quality and its general identiﬁability,a topic that has not received much attentionso far. 3.01.01. Finite Impulse Response+powerspectral density (FIR+PSD) The FIRis a simpleand widely used modelin thermoacoustics[28–33].It canbe derived from the general polynomialmodel structure shown in Eq.(2)by setting the polynomialﬁlters A,C,D and F equal to unity ̇Q′(t,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ e(t) (4) A.3 P APER -SI N OISE, J.

Journal of Sound and Vibration, 422, Elsevier, 2018. 437 M. Merk etal. / Journal of Sound and Vibration 422432–452 The output of the model̇Q′(t,𝛉) is computed by relating only prior inputsu′(t) to the current output via the polynomial ﬁlter B(q,𝛉).The parametervector 𝛉 contains the model coeﬃcients 𝛉 ={ b 0, b 2, …,bnb} wherein nb speciﬁes the number of model coeﬃcients used and therefore the model order. The largernb the more prior inputs are taken into account and consequently more complex system responses can be modeled. Note that auto-regressive behavior cannot be taken into account inan FIRmodel since no former outputsq−1 ̇Q′(t)are used for thecomputationof ̇Q′(t).Regarding the noise treatment, it is emphasized that the FIR model structure does not come with any noise model estimates. The poly- nomial ﬁlters C(q,𝛉) and D(q,𝛉) are equal to unity and the FIR model assumes the noise to be Gaussian white noise with unity variance. Yet, as shown by Silvaet al a rough estimation of the noise term is possibleafter the identiﬁcation of the FIR modelandcan beseen asan additionalpost-processing step.The contribution ofacolorednoiseterm isconsequentlynot taken into accountduring the identiﬁcation process. Recalling the aforementioned assumptionfrom Fig. 1 saying ̇Q′ sum(t,𝛉)= ̇Q′ c(t,𝛉)+ ̇Q′ s (5) the term ̇Q′ c(t,𝛉)canbe replaced by B(q,𝛉)u′(t)after the identiﬁcation. The noise contribution oḟQ′ sum can then beexpressed as the unexplained portionbetween measured outpuṫQ′ sum and the modeloutput ̇Q′ c as ̇Q′ s = ̇Q′ sum −B(q,𝛉)u′(t). (6) By taking the power spectral density (PSD)of the noise terṁQ′ s, here denoted as PQQ PQQ(𝜔)= 2Δt N |||||| N−1∑ n=0 ̇Q′ se−i𝜔nΔt |||||| (7) the normalized spectral distribution of the noise term can be computedby ̂Qs(𝜔)= √ PQQ(𝜔) 2Δt. (8) herein 𝜔and N stand for the angular frequency and the total sample number of the time discrete input-output series, respec- tively. Forthe estimationof the spectral noise distributionno SI techniques are involved. Note that the simple subtraction made in Eq.(6) is strictly seen only valid under open loop conditions. For closed loop conditions,a biaserror isintroduced, which is proportional tothe cross-correlationmatrix between input and noise signal. Due tothe ﬂame inherent intrinsic thermoacousticfeedbackthe ﬂamesystemis alwaysa closedloopsystemandthis biaserror is thus unavoidable. Yet, as the magnitude of the introduced bias error is unclear and the FIR model structure is widely used in the ﬁeld of thermoacoustics,the performance of this rather simple estimation approach will be tested against model structures that include a noise model estimation. 3.01.02. Autoregressive Exogenous Model (ARX) The ARX model structure can be derived from the general polynomial model structure of Eq.(2) by setting the polynomial ﬁlters C(q,𝛉),D(q,𝛉)and F(q,𝛉)equal to unity.Compared to the FIR model describedin the previous subsection,the ARX model structure additionallyincludes the polynomialﬁlter A(q,𝛉)and reads as A(q,𝛉) ̇Q′(t,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ e(t) (9) Thepolynomialﬁlter A(q,𝛉)heretakesalsoprioroutputs q−i ̇Q′(t)intoaccountandallowsthusthedescriptionofauto-regressive behavior. If an internal feedback mechanism is present in thesystem, the ARX model structure requires less model parameters than the FIR model to describe the in theoryinﬁnite response of the system to a given input. This yields a better estimateof the unknown model parameters contained in𝛉 as their variance is decreased. By reformulating Eq.(9)to ̇Q′(q,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉) A(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ 1 A(q,𝛉)e(t) (10) it gets evident that the ARX model structure also provides a noise model with 1∕A(q,𝛉). However, from Eq.(10) it can be seen that both the plant model G(q,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉)∕A(q,𝛉) and the noise model H(q,𝛉)= 1∕A(q,𝛉) share the same polynomial ﬁlter A(q,𝛉). This implies that plant and noise model share the same poles and consequently the same dynamics. An independent modeling of plant and noise dynamics is not possiblewith an ARX model structure.

Box-Jenkins(BJ) The BJ model structure represents the most general and thusmost ﬂexible model structure that can be derived from Eq.(2) and reads as ̇Q′(t,𝛉)= B(q,𝛉) F(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ C(q,𝛉) D(q,𝛉)e(t) (11) It contains the polynomialfractions B(q,𝛉)∕F(q,𝛉)and C(q,𝛉)∕D(q,𝛉)describing the plant modeldynamicsand the noise model dynamics,respectively.Regardingthe previouslydescribed ARX modelstructure, the BJ model structureallowsanindependent characterization of plant and noise model and is therefore also consistent for closed loop systems. Yet, as four indepen- dent polynomial ﬁlters have to be estimated, the number of model coeﬃcients that need to be determined is higher than for an FIR model or an ARX model. This in turn yields usually higher model coeﬃcient variances or requires more training data. 3.02. Model coeﬃcient estimation Once a certain model structure is chosen, the next step in the SI procedure is the determination of the respective model coeﬃcients contained in the parametervector𝛉. Accordingly, a least squares optimizationpr oblemcanbefor mulatedas min 𝛉 J(𝛉) ≡ min 𝛉 N N−1∑ i=0 ( ̇Q′(iΔt,𝛉)− ̇′(iΔt) )2, (12) where the cost function J(𝛉) is minimized. The cost function J(𝛉) depends on the estimated model parameter vector𝛉 and is herein deﬁnedasthe squarederror betweenthe modeledoutput ̇Q′(iΔt,𝛉)and therealoutputofthe time discreteinput-output time series ̇′(iΔt). Depending on the model structure chosen, the least squares optimization problem in Eq.(12) has to be solved differently. Thisdistinctionarisesfromhowthemodelstructurerelatestheunpredictablewhitenoiseterm e(t)tothemodeloutput ̇Q′(t,𝛉). Ifan FIRmodelstructureis used,no noisemodel H(q,𝛉)is takeninto account.The predicted modeloutpuṫQ′(t,𝛉)onlydepends ontheinputsignal u′(t).The leastsquaresoptimizationproblembecomeslinearandcanbesolvedforexampleviatheso-called Wiener-Hopf inversion (WHI) [23–25]. A good estimate of𝛉 from the WHI requires uncorrelated input and noise signals, as s h o w ni n R e f. otherwise a biased estimate results from the WHI. If a model structure is chosen that explicitly applies a noise model H(q,𝛉),themodel’soutput ̇Q′(t,𝛉)dependsateachinstantonthe current contributionof thenoiseterm e(t).Butas aforementioned, the current contribution of the noise terme(t) is by deﬁnition unpredictable. Therefore, Eq.(1) has to be cast into the so-called one-step ahead predictionform. First Eq.(1)is rewritten as ̇Q′(t,𝛉)= G(q,𝛉)u′(t)+ H(q,𝛉)e(t)= G(q,𝛉) u′(t)+ v(t), (13) wherein v(t)= H(q,𝛉)e(t) ⟶e(t)= H(q,𝛉)−1 v(t) (14) describes the colored noise contribution. As the noise contributione(t) is unknown at the current time step the best possible prediction ofv(t)can be achieved bytaking all contributions ofe(t)except the current one into account. This results in v(t|t −1,𝛉)= (H(q,𝛉)− 1)e(t) (15) The notationv(t|t −1,𝛉) indicates the one-step ahead prediction of the colored noise term. It is computed by a convolution of the noise model with all prior noise contributions ofe(t). Next, by combining Eq.(14) and Eq.(15) the relation between the one-step ahead predictionv(t|t −1)and the actualcolored noisetermv(t)adds up to v(t|t −1,𝛉)=( 1−H(q,𝛉)−1)v(t) (16) Next, inserting the one-step ahead prediction of the colored noise term into Eq.(13) results in an expression for the one-step ahead predicted output Q′(t|t −1,𝛉)according to ̇Q′(t|t −1,𝛉)= G(q,𝛉)u′(t)+( 1−H(q,𝛉)−1)v(t) (17) hereinthecolorednoisecontribution v(t)canbereplacedbythesubtractionoftherealoutput ̇Q′(t)fromtheplantmodeloutput v(t)= ̇Q′(t)− G(q,𝛉)u′(t) (18) yielding the ﬁnal form of the one-step aheadprediction ̇Q′(t|t −1,𝛉)= G(q,𝛉)u′(t)+( 1−H(q,𝛉)−1)( ̇Q′(t)− G(q,𝛉)u′(t)) (19) It is emphasized that the predicted model output in Eq.(19) is now dependent on the discrete output time serieṡQ′(t).T h i s means that for the prediction of the model outpuṫQ′(t|t−1,𝛉) not only all inputs, but also all outputs up to the current time A.3 P APER -SI N OISE, J.

For further detailsthe reader is again referred to. 3.03. Regularization of identiﬁcation The key idea of regularization is to constrainthe model’sﬂexibility in order to decreasethe variance of the estimated model coeﬃcients.Itallowsthustocontrolthetrade-offbetweenthemodel’saccuracyanditsvariance.Hence,thecostfunctionshown in Eq.(12)is extended in order to penalize the model’s ﬂexibility J(𝛉)reg = J(𝛉)+𝜆𝛉T𝐑𝛉 (21) herein 𝜆deﬁnes a constant scalar regularization parameter that determines the trade-off between accuracy and variance. The larger the regularization parameter𝜆, the lower the accuracy of the model but also the variance of the estimated model coeﬃ- cients in𝛉 is decreased. The positive deﬁnite matrix R allows a weighting of the respective model coeﬃcients. A more detailed interpretation of the regularization parameters is given by Chenet al. If only short input-output time series are available, which is often the case for computationally expensive LES computations, regularization might help to limit the variance of the estimatedmodelparameters.The effect andbeneﬁtofregularizationonthe identiﬁcationofthe plant modelwasalreadyinves- tigated.However, the effect ofregularization on the identiﬁed noise model is yet unclear and shall be investigated in the present study.The regularization technique will be applied on the ARX model structure. 4. Generation of surrogate data As mentioned in Section 2 the goal of the present study is to investigate theidentiﬁability of noise models and assess their quality. Testing different time series properties on LES generated data would be computationally very expensive. A surrogate data model is used instead in the present study. The surrogatedata model consists of a linear acoustic network model that is solved in the time domain in order to generate a discrete input-output time series needed for the subsequent identiﬁcation process. Acoustics within the network model are treated as linear and described by plane waves. The plane wave assumption holds as longas the cross-sectionof the geometry is much smallerthan the acousticwavelength of interest. Forthe given setup this condition is fulﬁlled as only frequencies below 1000 Hz are considered: Flames typically exhibit a low-pass behavior and combustionnoiseis known to beactiveinthe lowfrequency region below 1000 Hz.Plane acousticwaves are describedvia the characteristic wave amplitudesf andg deﬁned as: Reproduction of Papers With permission from M.

The duct sections shown in Fig. 2 are assumed to be much shorter than the minimal investigated wave length.

The heat release rate ﬂuctuatioṅQ′ is described by its two contributionṡQ′ c and ̇Q′ s,w h i c ha r e modeled via the plant modeland the noise model,respectively. Itis emphasized that the plantmodel and the noise model used inthesurrogatedatamodel,willserveasreferencemodelsfortheestimatedmodelsofthe SIprocedure.Asthereference models are used to generate the surrogate data, accurately identiﬁed models should be as close as possible to the reference models. In principle the reference models are a matter of choice. However,note that in the present study, the reference models (structure and order) should correspond to a model typically found in a thermoacoustic system. Otherwise the input-output time series properties found for an accurate identiﬁcation of FTF and noisemodel, do not agree with those of the LES/SI approach applied ona realcombustor.Forexampleareference modelin thesurro gatedataapproachwithavery h igh modelorderwould require overly long time series for an accurate identiﬁcation. To ensure a fairly realistic reference model in the surrogate data approach, a LES generated input-output time series of a turbulent swirl combustor is used for the identiﬁcation of the referencemodels. As reference model structure the most general BJ formulation is chosen with the polynomialﬁlterordersnb = 30,nc = 5,nd = 5 a n dnf = 1, see also Table 1. The choice of the BJ structure as a reference model is physically motivated. First, as shown by Silvaet al, the impulse response function of premixed ﬂames is ﬁnite. Therefore, thereference model structure does not include an auto-regressive polynomial F(q,𝛉). Second, combustion noise is known to be colored,m e a n i n gt h a ti ti sn o te q u a l l yd i s t r i b u t e do v e r the whole frequency range. This requires an explicit modeling of the noise term, since the white noise assumption as done e.g. in the FIR model structure, does not hold. Yet, the exact combustion noise dynamics are still unclear from a systems theory point of view. Hence the BJ model structure is the most convenient choice because it does not impose any restrictions on the noise term and does not result in a loss of generality. The resulting models are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The reference FTF exhibits reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured FTF of Komarek and Polifke and it can be concluded that the reference FTF is accurate enough to represent all relevant features of the turbulent swirl combustor. Its model order is suﬃcient. After the reference models are determined and the geometrical elements are adapted to the combustor geometry described in Ref. the network elements described can be formulated in state-space form and lumped together. This yields one state- spacemodel describing the entire network model ̇x(𝐭)= 𝐀𝐱 +𝐁 [ fex(t) e(t) ] (26) [ u′(t) ̇Q′(t) ] = 𝐂𝐱 +𝐃 [ fex(t) e(t) ] (27) A.3 P APER -SI N OISE, J. Sound Vib.

Merk etal. / Journal of Sound and Vibration 422432–452 Using the thermoacoustic network tool ta X, the state-space model can be simulated in time to generate the surrogate input-output time series needed for the following identiﬁcation process. Note thatfex(t) in Eq. (26) is a broad-band forcing signal imposed at the inlet of the system, as shown in Fig. 2. In accordance to typical LES values and if not speciﬁed otherwise, the length of the generated time series is equal to 350 ms and the forcing amplitude amountsto 10%of the meanﬂow velocity. The second input signale(t) in Eq.(26) describes a random Gaussian distributed white noise signal with zero mean and unity variance. After being ﬁltered by the noise model it represents the stochastic contribution to the output caused by combustion noise. Because this contribution changes randomly during every simulation of the network model, different output time series are obtained for every realization. This is in line with the LES/SI approach. For unchanged working conditions but randomly different initial ﬁelds, the stochastic contribution of turbulent combustion noise manifests itself in varying output time series for each LES run. Consequently, the identiﬁed model may vary in accuracy. To take this uncertainty into account a Monte-Carlo approach is used in the present study. Every system with a certain test combination of parameters is evaluated 100 times. Due to the stochastic contributione(t)each input-output time series is unique and yields consequently different models for G(q,𝛉) and H(q,𝛉). From the dataset for every test combinationof parameters the mean model error (see Section 5.01)and its standard deviationcan becomputed. Compared to the direct use of LES data, using a surrogate data approach to investigate the simultaneous identiﬁability of FTF and combustion noise model has two advantages. First, thechosen surrogate data approach is computationally eﬃcient. This allowsto quicklygenerate multiplerealizationsofinput-ou tput timeseries datawithvarying timeserieslength, excitation amplitude or reﬂection conditions. Second, in a surrogate data approach thetrue FTF and thetrue noise model are knowna priori, which would not be the case for a LES generated time series. The knowledge of thetrue models that are used to generate the data in the ﬁrst place allows the calculation of the error made by the identiﬁed model against thetrue model. Of course, the ultimateaim is to apply the methodology on actual LES data,which is ongoing work, however, the surrogate data approach helps to obtain ﬁrst a better understanding of the method itself. 5. Model quality assessment An important aspect within the LES/SI approach is the model’s quality assessment. The quality of the identiﬁed model usu- ally depends on two general aspects: The chosen model structure and the respective polynomial model order. The model structure has to reﬂect the physics of the studied system. It should incorporate an auto-regressive part if a feedback loop is present in the original system or include a noise model if the stochastic perturbations are not white. An inadequate model structure usually yield a biased estimate of the identiﬁed model. Again, biased here means that a systematic error is introduced impeding the identiﬁed model to converge towards thetrue solution, even in the limit of inﬁnitely long time series data. The bias introduced by different model structures into the FTF was already examined in Ref. However, how the noise model part H(q,𝛉) depends on the chosen model structure is yet unclear and is addressed in the current Fig. 3.FTF used in the surrogate datamodel: reference BJ model structure (solid), experimentally measured FTF ( c i r c l e s ).

Merk etal. / Journal of Sound and Vibration 422432–452442 study. To compare the error made by different model structures theap r i o r iknowledge of the reference model is exploited. Details on the model error calculation are given insubsection 5.01. After a certain model structure is selected, the next step in the LES/SI approach consists in choosing a polynomial model order, i.e. choosing the number of polynomial model coef- ﬁcients {na,nb,nc,nd,nf}. This is an important step because accuracy and variance of the identiﬁed model depend crucially on the polynomial order. If the polynomial model order is chosen too small, the identiﬁed models are said to beunder- resolved and are not able to fully mimic the system’s input-outputbehavior. Inaccurate models result from the identiﬁca- tion. Over-ﬁtting refers to the case, in which the polynomial model order is chosen higher than necessary. If the polyno- mial model order of the FTF is too high, it starts to describe stochastic processes in the particular realization of the train- ing data set and vice versa if the noise model order is higher than adequate. The ﬁtting of the noise realization implies high variances of the model coeﬃcients. Even though the over-ﬁtted model is able to describe the training data set with a high accuracy, the identiﬁed model coeﬃcients come with a signiﬁcant uncertainty. The over-ﬁtted model is thus not gen- eral, but is tailored to the speciﬁc input-output time series. It would fail on a test data set, as the stochastic contribution would be different. The choice of the model structure and its model order is thus always a trade-off between generality and ac c u r ac y.A no p t i m alm o d e lu s e sasf e wm o d e lc o e ﬃ c i e n t sasp o s s ibleto describe the system’sdynamicswith acceptableaccu- racy.Thisisalsoknownasthe principleofparsimony.Themostsuitablemodelorderisnotknownbeforehand.Foran FIR model the number of coeﬃcients necessary can be roughly estimatedby number of relevant time lags that need to be captured. If a more complex model structure is chosen such as ARX or BJ, the best model order of the auto-regressive part or the noise model is not evident. To ﬁnd a suitable model order for these model structures Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) (sub- section 5.02) and a residual analysis (subsection 5.03) will be used. Besides their robustness these methods have the advantage that conclusions on the identiﬁed model quality canbe drawn even without the knowledge of thetruemodels,which is usually the case in the LES/SI approach. 5.01. Calculationof noise model error The agreement between the reference noise model Href(j𝜔) a n dt h ei d e n t i ﬁ e dm o d e lf r o ms urrogate data can be expressed via the noise modelerrorΔas Δ ≡ ‖‖Href(j𝜔)− H(j𝜔,𝛉)‖‖2 ‖H(j𝜔,𝛉)‖2 (28) wherein ‖·‖2 denotes the2-norm given as ‖H(j𝜔)‖2 = √ 2𝜋 ∫ 𝜋 −𝜋 H(j𝜔)H H(j𝜔)d𝜔 (29) The error term is evaluated in the frequency domain and across all deﬁned frequencies. No weighting of certain frequencies is applied. The noise model errorΔ allows a quantitative comparison between the reference model and the estimated one. Thus conclusions on the accuracyand suitabilityofdifferent modelstructures can bedrawn. 5.02. Akaike’s Information Criterion Akaike’s Information Criterion can be used to determine the best model order for a certain model structure. Best refers here to the trade-off between the models accuracy and its variance. In its normalized from the AICreads as n AIC ≡ log ( det ( N N−1∑ i=0 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)(𝜖(iΔt,𝛉))T )) + 2 np N (30) herein𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)describesthemodelresidual,and np isthetotalnumberofestimatedcoeﬃcie nts.Themodelresidualisdescribed similar to Eq.(20) a st h ed i f f e r e n c eb e t w e e nt h er e a lo u t p u ta n dt h ep r e d icted one. It represents the portion of the real output time series, which is not explained by the identiﬁed model and is deﬁned as 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)= ̇′(iΔt)− ̇Q′(iΔt|(i−1)Δt,𝛉) (31) The ﬁrst term of the n AIC in Eq.(30)increases if the model residuals𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)increase, as it would be the case for an inaccurate model.Thesecondtermin Eq. (30)growswiththenumberofusedpolynomialcoeﬃcientsandgrowsthuswiththemodelorder. According to Akaike’s theory, the lower the AIC the better theselected model order. Consequently the AIC provides a quality metric that judges thementioned trade-offbetweenmodelaccuracyand itsvariance asit penalizes both,model inaccuraciesas well as high model orders. Results ofthe AIC areshown in Section 6.02. A.3 P APER -SI N OISE, J. Sound Vib. With permission from M. Merk, S. Jaensch, C.Silva, and W. Polifke.

Merk etal. / Journal of Sound and Vibration 422432–452 5.03. Residual analysis A second method helping to determine a suitable model order is based on a correlation analysis of the model residuals 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉). The residualanalysisconsistof two different tests:The Independence Test and the Whiteness Test. The Independence Test is basedon the cross-correlation between the model residuals𝜖and priors inputsudeﬁned as 𝛾𝜖u(k,𝛉)= 1 √ 𝐊uu(0,𝛉)𝐊𝜖𝜖(0,𝛉) N −k N−k∑ i=1 (( 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)− 𝜖 )( u((i+k)Δt)− u )) (32) herein 𝐊uu(0,𝛉)and𝐊𝜖𝜖(0,𝛉)are the ﬁrst elements of the auto-correlationvector of the model inputs and the model residuals, respectively. According to the Independence Test the residualsshould be uncorrelated to prior inputs, which is fulﬁlled if the cross-correlation values𝛾𝜖u(k,𝛉) are statistically insigniﬁcant. Statistical insigniﬁcance can be assumed if all values of𝛾𝜖u(k,𝛉) are within a certain conﬁdence region, e.g. the 99% conﬁdence region deﬁned as 2.058/ √ N. A signiﬁcant correlation between residuals and input means that the identiﬁed plant model G(t,𝛉) describes the system’s dynamics insuﬃciently. A value of 𝛾𝜖u(k,𝛉)outside the conﬁdence region at a certain time lagkimplies that the outpuṫQ′(iΔt,𝛉)that originates from the input at timeu((i−k)Δt)is not correctly described by the model because the residual contains input information. So the Independence Test allows primarily an estimation of the plant model order that should be chosen high enough to pass the Independence Test, but not higher in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. The Whiteness Test ensures that the residuals are an unpredictable random process. This is given if the auto-correlation values of the model residuals 𝛾𝜖𝜖(k,𝛉)= 1 𝐊𝜖𝜖(0,𝛉) N −k N−k∑ i=1 (( 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)− 𝜖 )( 𝜖((i+k)Δt)− 𝜖 )) (33) are always within a certain conﬁdence region. A signiﬁcant auto-correlation of the model residuals exhibits the possibility of predicting the residual dynamics that are not related to the input signal. These residual dynamics may e.g. correspond to a colored noise contribution. Especially in the framework of thermoacoustics this is of high relevance as combustion noise is known to be colored and only active in a certain frequency range. Hence, the model order of the stochastic model can be estimated by means of the Whiteness Test. Again, the stochastic model order should be selected high enough to pass the Whiteness Test, but not unnecessarily higher. Results of the Independence Test and the Whiteness Test for surrogate data time series are shown in Section 6.02. 6. Results The following result sectionis dividedinto two parts.Section 6.01 dealswith the questionof howdifferent models structures (FIR+PSD, regularized ARX, BJ) generally perform regarding different time series and system properties, namely the excitation amplitude,the reﬂection conditions and the time series length. After the investigation of different model structures Section 6.02 focusesontheestimationofthemodelorder,assumingthatthe truemodelorderisunknown. Them odelidentiﬁcationanddata processing is realized byusing the system identiﬁcationtoolboxof Matlab 2016 b. 6.01. Model structure In this ﬁrst subsection advantage is taken of the fact that thetrue FTF and noise model are known in the chosen surrogate data approach. This allows the computation of the noise model errorΔ made by the identiﬁed noise models compared to the reference model, see Section 5.01.T h e 9 5%conﬁdence interval of the noise model errorΔcan becomputed from the 100 Monte Carlo Samples of eachrealization. A similar study was already performed. However, therein only the evolution of the plant model error was investigated. Even for model structures as ARX or BJ the noise model part of the identiﬁed models was not further taken into account. But since also the noise model part contains valuable information on the physics of the system, especially in the framework of thermoacoustics, the focus within the current section is laid on the noise model estimates. Consequently only the errors made forthenoisemodelestimationareshowninthefollowingsections.Fortherespectivebehaviorofthe FTFmodelerrorthereader is referred to. This section aims to carve out the differences between the model structures and not yet the inﬂuence of the respective model order. Accordingly, the respective model orders are setconstantly equal to the reference model, described in Section 4. The used FIR models have a model order ofnb = 30 whereas the ARX models have an additional polynomial ﬁlter of order naarx = nc BJ = nd BJ = 5. 6.01.01. Inﬂuenceof excitationamplitude First the inﬂuence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the quality of the identiﬁed models is investigated. To get a behav- ior comparable to a real LES/SI application, the time series length is limited to 350 ms, which is a typically affordable length Reproduction of Papers With permission from M.

Non-reﬂective boundary conditions are applied with Ru = Rd = 0. The ampli- tude of the excitation signalfex in the surrogate data model is varied between 1%− 20% of the mean ﬂow velocity in order to realize different SNR. Note that in a LES/SI application the forcing amplitude is limited. If the forcing amplitude is cho- sen too high, the ﬂame response may become non-linear, which makes a linear identiﬁcation impossible. In the surrogate data approach, however, the system responds linearly by deﬁnition, thus also the behavior in the limit of large SNR may be investigated. The evolution of the noise model errorΔ with increasing excitation is shown in Fig. 5.B yﬁ r s tf o c u s i n go nt h e F I R+PSD model, it can be observed that it is inferior to the other two model structures over the entire amplitude range. It does not only result in larger mean noise model errors (dotted line in Fig. 5) but also provides the largest conﬁdence intervals (shaded area). Asdemonstratedin Ref.[ 25]forthermoacousticapplications,an FIRmodelforthe FTFyieldsbiasedplantmodelestimatesifthe noise contributionisnotwhite orthe systemexhibits afeedbackmechanism thatcausesacorrelationbetweeninput signaland noise term. Dueto the simplisticcomputationofthe noise contributioninthe FIR+PSDapproach,the plantmodelandthe noise modelare notindependent, see Eq. (6).Thesimplesubtractionin Eq. (6)is responsiblefor thefactthaterrors inthe plantmodel directly propagate into the noise model part resulting in poor estimates of the noise model. In the range of small excitation amplitudes (1%− 6%), the small SNR yields poorplant model estimations.This in turn results in noise model estimates of poor accuracy. Above a certain excitationamplitude the noise model errorΔremains at a constant level. Comparing the two remaining model structures, it can be observed that the noise model estimates of the regularized ARX model provide similar noise modelerrorsΔas the BJ model structurefor smallexcitationamplitudes.Dueto the regularization of the ARX model the conﬁdence intervals remain relatively narrow even for small forcing amplitudes. The non-regularized BJ model structure shows here signiﬁcantly wider conﬁdence intervals. However, if the forcing amplitude is increased, the BJ model structure yieldsmaller noise modelerrorsΔcomparedto the regularized ARX model. The narrower conﬁdence intervals of the regularized ARX model arebought by a slightly larger noise model errorΔ. 6.01.02. Inﬂuenceofacousticreﬂectionconditions In many applications the ﬂame is exposed to acoustic waves that are reﬂected at the acoustic boundaries of the system and subsequently fed back into the ﬂame. Besides the already present ﬂame inherent feedback mechanism, these acoustic reﬂections at the domain boundaries introduce an additional feedback mechanism. The strength of this feedback loop can be quantiﬁed e.g. bythe outlet reﬂection coeﬃcient Rd deﬁned as the fraction ofincoming to outgoing acousticwave Rd = gd fd (34) Depending on the values of the reﬂection coeﬃcient Rd, the system’s stability may change from stable to unstable working conditions, in which self-sustained thermo-acoustic oscillationsarise. Fig. 6 represents the inﬂuence of the downstream reﬂection coeﬃcient (see Fig. 2) on the identiﬁed noise model. The time series data for all Monte Carlo realizations have a length of 350 ms with a forcing amplitude of 10%.A g a i nt h e F I R+PSD model structureexhibitsthelargestnoisemodelerror Δthroughouttheparameterspaceexamined.Moreover,onlythe FIR +PSDmodel structureshowsadependencyofthenoisemodelerroronthedownstreamreﬂectioncoeﬃcient Rd.Thiscanbeexplainedbythe lackofanyauto-regressivetermsinthe FIRmodelstructure.The largertheoutletreﬂectioncoeﬃcient Rd becomes,thestronger the feedback loop across the acoustic boundaries gets and consequently the larger the error made by an FIR model structure. Again, the error of the plant model propagates then directly into the noise model part. The regularized ARX and the BJ model structure include an auto-regressive part and hence do not show a dependency of the noise model error on the outlet reﬂection coeﬃcient. A.3 P APER -SI N OISE, J.

For the LES/SI approach this implies an extension of the validity range. As long as the system remains linearly stable, com- pletely non-reﬂective boundary conditions are not needed inthe LES for a proper noise model identiﬁcation. Only a model structure has to be chosen that includes auto-regressive terms, such as ARX or BJ. The FIR+PSD approach still provides rea- sonable estimates for reﬂecting boundary conditions, however, a stronger increase of the noise model error with increasing reﬂection is observable. 6.01.03. Behaviorin thelimit of inﬁnite longtime series Inthis sectionthe inﬂuence ofthe timeseries length onthe noisemodelidentiﬁcationis examined.Whereas in experiments the measurement of relatively long time series is generally affordable,the time series length in LES is limited by the large com- putational effort. A study of the dependence of the model error on the time series length is thus important for the application of the LES/SI approach.Fig. 7 plots the noise model error over the length of the input-output time series used for the identiﬁca- tion.Theexcitationamplitudeamounts 10 %ofthemeanﬂowvelocity,non-reﬂective boundaryconditionsareapplied.Thetime serieslengthisnormalizedbytheimpulseresponselength 𝜏,whichdependsontheﬂamelengthandaconvectivevelocityclose to the mean ﬂow velocity. An usually affordable LES generated time series of 350 ms, as it was used in the two previous sections, corresponds approximatelyto 30𝜏. In accordance with, the noise model should converge towards the reference model in the limit of inﬁnitely long time series if a proper model structure is applied. Correspondingly, the BJ model in Fig. 7 converges towards a noise model errorΔ equal to zero. The respective conﬁdence intervals decrease with longer time series. However, the other two model structures yield biasedestimatesof the noise model even for very long time series, although their conﬁdence intervals decrease for longer timerseries.Since the ARXmodel structure comesupatleastwitha noisemodelestimation(thecommon A(q,𝛉)polynomialof FTF and noise model)its biasis smallerthan for the FIR+PSD modelstructure in the limit oflong timeseries. Yet, the constraint of the common polynomial A(q,𝛉) forces the plant model and the noise model to undergo the same dynamics, which is not Reproduction of Papers With permission from M. Merk, S.

An ARX model structure is used as reference model: FIR+PSD (dotted), regularized ARX(dash-dotted), BJ (solid). the case for the reference BJ model structure. Thus a bias for the regularized ARX model structure results compared to the BJ reference model. To underline the potential and the ﬂexibility of the BJ model structure, the reference model is now replaced by an ARX reference model withnb = 30 and na = 5. The same study as in Fig. 7 is carried out.Fig. 8 shows that also the ARX model structure is converging now towards the reference model for long timer series. This is not surprising as it agrees with the reference model structure in this case. But also the BJ models converge towards the correct solution, although the reference model has an ARX structure. This is possible as the BJ model structure is more ﬂexible than the ARX model structure. With its independent polynomials D(q,𝛉) and F(q,𝛉) it allows to cover also the case of shared dynamics between plant and noise model. In this case D(q,𝛉)≈ F(q,𝛉) holds. However, in the range of short time series it exhibits slightly larger errors than the ARX model structure since more polynomial ﬁlters (F(q,𝛉) and D(q,𝛉) instead of only A(q,𝛉)) and consequently more model coeﬃcients have to be estimated. As already observable in Fig. 7,t h e F I R+PSD model structure does not converge towards the correct solution in the limit of inﬁnitely long time series. In the framework of the LES/SI approach this means that the BJ model structure is the most ﬂexible one and has thus the largest range of validity. As especially the combustion noise dynamics are still unclear from a systems theory point of view, the BJ model structure is the most convenient choice. It provides unbiased estimates for independent plant and noise model dynamics as well as for a commondynamic behavior. 6.02. Model order Note thatin the previous section,the modelorder for all experiments and Monte Carlorealizations has been the sameasthe reference model order. This was only possible asthe reference model and its model order were knownap r i o r i. In a usual LES/SI application this is not the case. Therefore, the focus of the following section is laid on the estimation and determination of the mostsuitablemodelorderof FTFandnoisemodel.Twodifferentmethodswillbeusedincombinationtoestimatethemostsuit- able model order: Akaike’s Information Criterion (Section 5.02) and a model residualanalysis (Section 5.03).It is emphasized that both methods maybe used without the knowledge of thetruereference model and are thus applicablein the LES/SI approach. To investigate the different model orders, the BJ referencemodel is used to generate a data set of 100 time series with a time series length of 350 ms each. Subsequently, from this data set of time series BJ models with varying polynomial order are identiﬁed.Inaﬁrststep,themodelorderoftheplantmodel G(q,𝛉)isstudiedinmoredetail,see Section 6.02.01.The identiﬁcation is evaluated for a range of different polynomial ﬁlter orders of the plant model, namely the ordernb of the polynomial ﬁlter B(q,𝛉)andnc ofthepolynomialﬁlter C(q,𝛉)isvaried.Forevery combinationofpolynomialﬁlterorders a Monte Carlosetof 100 s am p l e si so b t ai n e d. Consequently in Section 6.02.02, the model order of the noise model H(q,𝛉) is further investigated. The plant model order of G(q,𝛉)is set tonb = 30 according to the reference model. Again, 100 Monte Carlo samples are generated for every combination of the polynomialmodel ordersnc and nd. 6.02.01. Plant modelorder As described already in Section 5.02, the AIC judges the trade-off between the model’s accuracy and its variance, depending onthechosenmodelorder:Thelowerthe AICvalue,the betterthetrade-off.The shadingin Fig.9 correspondstothemeann AIC value ofthe Monte Carlo dataset.Foranimprovedreadabilitythe globalabsoluteminimum value ofall combinationsis usedas an offset.

The mean values are computed from 100 Monte Carlo samples per combination. Due to the chosen normalization, theoverall best combinationhas a value equal to zero. the shading the respective numeric meanvalue percombinationis given in Fig. 9. The optimal n AIC value appears fornb = 30 andnc = 5, which is equal to the reference model order. For smaller values of nb the AIC values steeply increase. In this region the identiﬁed plant models are under-resolved and are not able to mimic the systems dynamics. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq.(30), which penalizes large model residuals, is dominant. The n AIC values alsoincrease again towardshigher modelorders of the studied parameterspace.Although the ﬁrst term in Eq.(30) becomes eventually smaller for higher model orders as the accuracy further increases, the second term on the right hand side of Eq.(30) becomesdominant. The large amountof modelparameters is penalized causingthe n AIC to rise. It is shown that the AIC converges towards the reference model order if enough data sets are evaluated. However, in the LES/SI approach usually only a few or even one time series is available. The AIC is thus rather a qualitative criterion for the chosenpolynomialordersincetherearevariationsintheidentiﬁ edmodelqualitywithineachcombinationofpolynomialorders. Consequently, if the AIC is applied only on one data set, it does not stringently provide the correct reference model order. So to ascertain the AIC predictions of the most suitable modelorder, a residual analysis may be used to judge whether the modelcapturesallrelevantdynamics.Theresidualanalysisallowstodetectmodelpartsthatarenotproperlyparametrized,e.g. which are under-resolved. To avoid over-ﬁtting the model order should be chosen as small as possible to still pass the residual tests. Moreover, the AIC does not allow conclusions on the absoluteerror made against a reference model. Hence, in the fol- lowing mean values and conﬁdence intervals of the identiﬁed models within a data set as well as a residual analysis for selected models are shown to underline the characteristics of certain combinations of polynomial model orders.Fig. 10(a) demonstrates the statistics for the data set withnb = 30 andnc = 5, represented by a square in Fig. 9. This combination cor- responds to the polynomial model order of the reference model. The mean value of the identiﬁed FTF and noise models agree well with the reference model. The model errors are small. For models with a higher model order than the reference model (not shown here) this would also be true, yet, these models would exhibit larger variance and consequently a wider conﬁdence interval. Fig. 10(b) depicts the residual analysis of the example model shown in Fig. 10(a) (dotted line). The cross-correlation values betweentheinput u′(iΔt)andthemodelresiduals 𝜖(iΔt,𝛉)donotexhibitanysigniﬁcance.Allvaluesfallintothe 99 %conﬁdence region,indicatingthatthereisnoremainingcorrelationbetween theinputandthemodelresiduals.Soallrelevantdeterministic processes are captured by the plant model and the Independence Test is passed. Also all auto-correlation values of the residual𝜖(iΔt,𝛉) lie within the shaded area of the 99%conﬁdence region, except the oneattimelagzero,which isequaltounityduetothe normalizationoftheauto-correlationvalues.Thisimpliesthatthere isno signiﬁcant auto-correlation within the model residuals and thatthe noise model thus captures all relevant dynamics contained in the process noise, e.g. a colored noise contribution. The chosen noise model order is high enough, the Whiteness Test is successful. If the Whiteness Test as well as the Independence Test are passed by an identiﬁed model, the model order can be assumed to be adequate. Again, an over-ﬁtted model would also pass the residual test. Therefore, the smallest possible model order, which still passes bothtests,should be chosen to avoidover-ﬁtting. In Fig. 11 the order of the FTF is reduced tonb = 20, the noise model order is kept equal to the reference model order with nc = nd = 5. This case is also represented in Fig. 9 by a square. From the statistics of the identiﬁed FTF, shown on top in Fig. 11(a), it can be observed that the conﬁdence intervals are slightly smaller than the ones of the case withnb = 30, but the meanvalue(solidline)showsadiscrepancytothereferencemodel(dashedline).The FTFisunder-resolvedandthusnotcapable of capturing all deterministic processes of the reference system. This is also observable in the Independence test in Fig. 11(b). The cross-correlation values for larger time lags fall outside the 99%conﬁdence region. This can be interpreted as follows: The outputof ̇Q′(iΔt)thatoriginatese.g.from the input u′((i−n)Δt)isnot correctlydescribedbythe model.This yieldsasigniﬁcant cross-correlation of the input signal and the model residual for time lags larger thann. This indicates that a higher model order for the plant model should be chosen. Reproduction of Papers With permission from M. Merk, S. Jaensch, C.Silva, and W. Polifke.

Accordingly, the mean values of the identiﬁed models, shown in Fig. 11(a), match the reference model and no signiﬁcant auto-correlation is observable in the model residuals, see bottom of Fig. 11(b). This example illustrates how the prediction of the AIC criterion regarding the plant model order may be assured by the residualanalysis. 6.02.02. Noise model order In a next step the noise model order shall be studied in detail. The polynomial model ordernb of the plant model G(q,𝛉) is held constant and set equal to the reference model order. The model ordersnc and nd of the noise model H(q,𝛉) are var- ied. In Fig. 12 it is conﬁrmed, that the AIC statistically converges to the reference model order. For the LES/SI approach this makes the AIC criterion a valuable qualitative metric as it serves as a quick screening of the parameter space and allows Fig. 10.Statistics of identiﬁed data set withnb = 30 andnc = 5 (a) and residual analysis of example model within the dataset (b).

Especially for the noise model, for which a sophisticated guess of the best model order is diﬃcult beforehand, the AIC can serve as a qualitative indicator. Again, certain model order combinations in Fig. 12 are investigated in more detail by means of their statistics and a residual analysis in order to get a more quan- titative insight on the identiﬁed models.Fig. 13(a) represents the statistics of the FTFs and noise models with a polyno- mial order ofnc = nd = 1. The estimates of the FTF is still in good agreement with the reference model as the plant model order is equal to reference model order withnb = 30. The Independence Test is consequently passed by the chosen example model (see Fig. 13(b)). However, very poor estimates of the noise model are obtained. This can also be observed in the failed Whiteness Test. The strong auto-correlation indicate that the model residuals are not following an unpredictable random pro- cessbutcontaincertainpredictabledynamics.This isalwaysthe caseifthenoisecontributioniscolored.The noisemodelorder should be increased to capture the dynamics contained in the noise contribution.Fig. 14 shows the results for a polynomial noise model order ofnc = 1 a n dnd = 5. Even though the polynomial C(q,𝛉) is under-resolved the mean value of the noise model predictions is in very good agreement with the reference model, see Fig. 14(a). Hence both residual tests are passed. If the overall noise model order is kept constant, but the model order of the auto-regressive noise model part is decreased, the situation is different. For a parametrization of the noise model equal tonc = 5 a n dnd = 1 the mean value of the noise model estimates differ stronger from the reference model, see Fig. 15(a). The insuﬃciently parametrized auto-regressive part of the noise model can also be observed in the Independence Test.

Conclusion Basedonasurrogatedatamodel,the Large E ddy Simulation/System Identiﬁcation(L ES/SI)approachisextendedtoallowthe additional identiﬁcation of a noise model. The identiﬁabilityof the noise model is systematically examined and the inﬂuence of different time series properties, such as time series length and signal-to-noise ratio is studied. It could be shown that the Box-Jenkins modelstructureissuperiortos implermodelstructures,especiallyifthe identiﬁedsystemcontainsanindependent colored noise contribution. This is expected in the case of identifying a turbulent ﬂame, which makes the Box-Jenkins model structure the most promising modeling approach for the simultaneous identiﬁcation of a ﬂame transfer function (FTF) and a respective noise model of a turbulent ﬂame. Even if the system is simpler and could be described by a model that exhibits shared dynamics ofplant and noise model (Autoregressive Exogenous Model, ARX),the Box-Jenkins model structure converges towards thetrue solution in the limit of inﬁnitive long time series. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the noise model of the Box-Jenkins model is not corrupted if reﬂecting boundary conditions are applied during the generation of the time series that are consequently used for the identiﬁcation. As long as the system studied remains linearly stable no dependency of the noise model error on the reﬂection coeﬃcient is observed. This increases the applicabilityof the LES/SI approach,since it can be used even ifperfectly non-reﬂective boundariesare not availablein the LES. The identiﬁabilityofthe noise model in setupsfeaturing a strong intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback is yet unclear and remains topic ofon-going research. Furthermore, two robust methods are demonstrated that allow the estimation of an adequate model order, which is espe- ciallyfor the noise model not evident beforehand. Akaike’s Information criterion provides qualitativeinformation on the model order of plant and noise model and judges the trade-off between a model’s accuracy and its variance. The subsequent residual analysisyields a moredetailed view on the respective parametrizationof FTFand noisemodel. The conducted study represents a solid basis for the application of advanced System Identiﬁcation techniques on real LES data.

Speciﬁcally, the incoming and outgoing characteristic wavesf and g extracted from the LES are used to determine the respective transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients via System Identiﬁcation (SI) techniques. (2) The ﬂame transfer function (FTF) is identi- ﬁed from LES time series data of upstream velocity and heat release rate. The transfer matrix of the reactive combustor is then derived by combining the FTF with the Rankine–Hugoniot (RH) relations across a compact heat source and a transfer matrix of the cold combustor, which is deduced from a linear network model. Linear algebraic transformation of the transfer matrix consequently yields the combustor scattering matrix. In a cross-comparison study that includes comprehensive experimental data, it is shown that both approaches successfully predict the scattering matrix of the reactive tur- bulent swirl combustor.[DOI: 10.01115/1.04040731] Introduction Increasing environmental awareness and stringent emission reg- ulations drive gas turbine manufacturers toward lean combustion technology. This technology comes with lower emissions of nitrogen oxides or unburnt hydrocarbons. Unfortunately, lean combustion systems are also susceptible to self-excited thermoa- coustic instabilities, which may generate pressure ﬂuctuations of intolerable amplitude, causing severe damage to an engine. For thermoacoustic stability analysis, a combustion system may conveniently be regarded as an assembly of elements, see Fig.1. The acoustic properties of individual combustor elements may be described in terms of the respectivetransfer matrix or alterna- tively the scattering matrix. Transfer and scattering matrices are interchangeable inasmuch as one may be transformed into the other by straightforward algebraic manipulation. However, as we shall elaborate below, these two descriptions of acoustic behavior are not fully equivalent to each other and there are situations where it is advantageous to use one instead of the other. The idea of describing individual elements of a complex acous- tic system by two-port matrices was introduced by Munjal. This approach has the advantage that the transfer behavior is inde- pendent of upstream and downstream impedance, which would not be true for a one-port element. For simple element types such as duct sections or area jumps, matrix coefﬁcients may be derived approximately by analytical methods. Coefﬁcient values for the geometrically more complex parts found in a combustor typically Fig. 1 Example of fragmenting a combustor into its acoustic elements 1 Corresponding author.

Indeed, sev- eral studies deduced matrix coefﬁcients for acoustically passive combustor parts of varying complexity, e.g. a single oriﬁce, a tandem oriﬁce, multiperforated liner plates, or a premixed nozzle. The acoustic transfer behavior of swirl generators, which are an unavoidable part in swirl stabilized combustion sys- tems, was numerically determined by Gikadi et al and Ni et al. A system of algebraic equations may be constructed from the collection of transfer (or scattering) matrices of the com- bustor elements. After closing this system with upstream and downstream boundary conditions, an “acoustic network model” or reduced order model (ROM) of the combustion system is obtained, which may be used, e.g. for linear stability analysis [9–11]. Experience has shown that this kind of analysis provides not only quantitative data on stability limits and dynamics of a combustion system but also important physical insight [9,11–16]. Several previous studies have concentrated on the transfer or scattering matrices of individual combustor elements such as a ﬂame, a burner, a swirl nozzle, or a dissipative element [3–6,8,9,11,13,14,17–19]. The present study concerns in an inte- grated fashion acombustor scattering matrixthat includes swirler, injection tube, and ﬂame as well as parts of the combustion cham- ber, see Fig.1. In the absence of a ﬂame, the passive parts of the combustor such as, e.g. swirler, area changes, or duct sections result in a cer- tain acoustic transmission and reﬂection behavior of the combus- tor, described by the nonreactive orcold combustor scattering matrix. Under reacting conditions, the ﬂame is anactive element that introduces an additional degree of complexity. This applies in particular to swirl ﬂames. Because of the swirling ﬂow, the com- plex geometries involved, and the intricacies of ﬂame dynamics with interaction of various physical processes, the assessed acoustic transfer relations will in general not be straightforward. The transfer matrix of a lean premixed gas turbine burner in a reactive or hot conﬁguration was studied experimentally by Paschereit et al. Transfer matrix coefﬁcients were meas- ured by successive monofrequent excitation of the combustor ﬂow with a two-source scheme. However, suchdirect measurement of a hot transfer matrix is very challenging and can be tedious. A careful calibration of the diagnostics is required for precise measurements of the acoustic variables and the downstream conditions in the reacting case are not conducive for precise measurements. Therefore, alternative methods for determining the transfer matrix of a burner or combustor under hot conditions are desira- ble. One possibility is the use of large eddy simulation (LES) to directly deduce the combustor transfer or scattering matrix from simulations with acoustic forcing, where a pre- scribed acoustic signal is imposed at the inlet or outlet of the LES domain. Considering that successive monofrequent excitation in LES entails very signiﬁcant computational costs, the LES/system identiﬁcation (SI) is the method of choice here. This approach is computationally efﬁcient, as it allows to identify transfer func- tions or matrices over a range of frequencies from a single simula- tion with broadband acoustic forcing. An indirect approach for determining a hot burner transfer matrix from a ﬂame transfer function (FTF), which relates upstream velocity ﬂuctuations to resulting heat release rate ﬂuctu- ations, is proposed by Keller and Polifke et al. Speciﬁ- cally, the hot burner transfer matrix is computed as the product of the transfer matrix of the cold burner and the transfer matrix of the ﬂame, which is deduced from the Rankine–Hugoniot (RH) equations that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across an acoustically compact zone of heat release. This composition method for the reactive conﬁguration has been applied successfully in several studies [ 13–15] and is also employed in the present study: the FTF is coupled via the RH rela- tions into a ROM of the full cold combustor, which is built from simpler acoustic elements (ducts, area jumps, ﬂame element, …, see Fig. 1), in order to determine the hot combustor transfer matrix. The direct as well as thecomposed approach come with certain advantages, but also limitations. The composed combustor scatter- ing matrix is valid only for systems that respect the modeling assumptions of the RHþFTF coupling, such as, e.g. acoustic compactness of the ﬂame and a dominant sensitivity of the ﬂame to upstream velocity perturbations. The latter is not always the case for technically premixed ﬂames. Moreover, simpliﬁcations due to the one-dimensional (1 D) acoustics assumption are made in the composed approach. All these limitations are nonexistent in the direct approach, as all relevant effects are fully described within the LES. This means that, e.g. for noncompact or techni- cally premixed ﬂames, only the direct approach is applicable. On the other hand, if the composed approach is applicable, it requires signiﬁcantly less computational effort than the direct approach. Even though both approaches require a computationally demand- ing LES in the ﬁrst place, the identiﬁcation offour frequency- dependent scattering matrix coefﬁcients requires longer LES time series data for accurate estimation than one FTF model. More important though, as long as changes in the combustor geometry do not have an impact on the FTF, they may be easily taken into account in the respective element of the network model. So, once the FTF is identiﬁed, scattering matrices for a wide parameter space may be derived by a simple re-evaluation of the adapted ROM. In the direct approach, new LES runs need to be carried out if the geometry within the computational domain is changed. The current work aims for a one-to-one comparison between the two different numerical methods of determining the scattering matrix of a turbulent swirl combustor in reacting conditions. This comparison provides valuable insight to which extent results of the two methods coincide for a case where the composed approach is applicable. Modeling results are also validated against and com- pared to experimental measurements of the FTF and the combustor scattering matrix. Note that a direct computation of a turbulent combustor scattering matrix with LES/SI constitutes a novelty and that a one-to-one comparison between the aforementioned methods is still lacking in literature for turbulent combustors. Transfer and Scattering Matrices Formally, the transfer matrix representation and the scattering matrix counterpart are mutually interchangeable. The transfer matrix deﬁnes the dynamic relation of the acoustic ﬁelds upstream and downstream of an element and is expressed in terms of primi- tive acoustic variables, i.e. the ﬂuctuation of pressure p 0 and velocity u 0 p 0 d qc u 0 d 75 ¼ T 11 T 12 T 21 T 22 \"# p 0 u qc u 0 u 75 (1) On the other hand, the scattering matrix is deﬁned in terms of the characteristic waves or Riemann invariants f ¼ 1 p 0 qc þ u 0 /C 18/C 19 (2 a) g ¼ 1 p 0 qc /C 0 u 0 /C 18/C 19 (2 b) and relates the outgoing characteristic waves (fd, gu) to the incom- ing counterparts (fu, gd) fd gu hi |ﬄ{zﬄ} response ¼ S 11 S 12 S 21 S 22 /C 20/C 21 fu gd hi |ﬄ{zﬄ} signal (3) As both representations are interchangeable, the scattering matrix coefﬁcients can be computed from the transfer matrix coefﬁcients by a simple algebraic transformation 021035-2 / Vol. 141, FEBRUARY 2019 Transactions of the ASME Reproduction of Papers M.

As shown in Eq.(3) and Fig. 2, the scattering matrix coefﬁ- cients S 11 and S 22 describe the transmission from upstream to downstream andvice versa. The scattering matrix coefﬁcients S 12 and S 21 deﬁne the reﬂection of characteristic waves impinging from downstream and upstream, respectively. Compared to the transfer matrix representation, the scattering matrix representation respects the causality of the system. The characteristic wavesf and g have a distinct propagation direction, which in turn allows to establish a causal relation between the inputsignal and the sys- tem’sresponse, see Eq.(3). A certain input signal causes a certain response of the system. This in turn means that the present output of the system only depends on the present and previous inputs. Even though the transfer matrix is related to the scattering matrix by simple algebraic relations, see Eqs. (4 a)–(4 d), it does not respect causality since the primitive acoustic variables, in which the transfer matrix is expressed, do not have a distinct propagation direction. Thus, a strict separation between inputsignal and sys- tem’s response is no longer possible. For further details on the causality of the respective representations, the reader is referred to Ref. Although only the scattering matrix respects causality, both representation exhibit certain advantages and disadvantages—so it makes sense to use both. On the one hand, the transfer matrix representation allows a ﬂuid dynamical interpretation of its coefﬁ- cients in terms of inertia and losses. The T 22 coefﬁcient, which relates upstream to downstream velocity perturbations, mainly characterizes the thermoacoustic interaction. On the other hand, the scattering matrix allows to set up an acoustic energy bal- ance determining the ampliﬁcation or damping across the scatter- ing object. Based on that, the system’s stability may be judged or possible feedback mechanism may be revealed. The scattering matrix representation is also helpful when it comes to the deﬁnition of a combustion noise source vector, as shown by Paschereit et al. In regard to the costs of determination, both representations are comparable. In experiments, often the transfer matrix is measured since the primitive acoustic variablesp 0 and u 0 can be assessed directly. In the LES/SI approach, the scattering matrix is easier to identify as it respects causality and allows thus to apply a causal ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) model. In the current work, the comparison between experimental and numeri- cal results is presented in terms of the scattering matrix represen- tation, since it provides a straight forward interpretation of the acoustic processes involved compared to the one given by the transfer matrix. Hence, the experimentally measured transfer mat- rices are transformed into the scattering matrix representation via Eqs. (4 a)–(4 d). Experimental Setup The investigated swirl combustor, shown in Fig.3, is located at EM 2 C laboratory, Paris. A mixture of methane and air is injected in a tranquilization box (not shown in Fig. 3). A loudspeaker (Monacor SP-6/108 PRO - 100 W RMS) is added at the bottom of the tranquilization box and generates the acoustic forcing corre- sponding to 10% of the mean inlet velocity. A plenum followed by a converging nozzle (contraction ratio: 8.073) generates a lami- nar ﬂow with a top-hat velocity proﬁle in the reference plane where a hot-wire probe HW (Dantec Dynamics Mini-CTA 54 T 30 with a 55 P 16 probe) is used to measure the velocity signalu 0 u (in the top-hat region of the proﬁle). At the same location, a micro- phone MHW (Bruel & Kjaer 4938) is used to measure the acous- tic pressure ﬂuctuationsp 0 u. A swirler (see Fig.4) comprising six off-centered radial vanes of radius R ¼ 3 mm (contraction ratio: 7.041) produces a ﬂow with a swirl number S ¼ 0.08 that was meas- ured by Laser Doppler Velocimetry in the conﬁnement chamber, just after the injector tube exit. A bluff body of conical shape is used to stabilize the ﬂame inside the conﬁnement chamber. A sec- ond convergent (contraction ratio: 2.003) is placed at the top of the combustion chamber, followed by an exhaust tube. The ﬂame investigated in this study is a perfectly premixed methane/air ﬂame with an equivalence ratio/ ¼ 0.082 and a thermal power of 5.05 k W. The associated bulk velocity at the hot-wire location is ub ¼ 5.04 m/s in a tube of diameter D ¼ 22 mm, yielding a Reyn- olds number of approximately Re/C 25 7000. Three microphones (Bruel & Kjaer 4938) are mounted on water-cooled waveguides in the hot gases region. The small Fig. 3 Sketch of the EM 2 C turbulent swirl combustor.

The ﬁrst two micro- phones, ME and ME 0 in Fig.3, are located directly opposed in the exhaust tube, 35 mm downstream of the second convergent. A third microphone, ME 00 in Fig. 3, is located 85 mm downstream the second convergent. In addition to the acoustic pressure ﬂuctu- ations p 0 d measured by ME 00 in the downstream region, the three- microphone method is used to reconstruct the acoustic veloc- ity ﬂuctuations u 0 d at the same axial position. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, all experiments are made twice: one in the original conﬁguration presented in Fig.3 and another one with the microphones ME 0 and ME 00 switched. Moreover, coher- ence functions are also adopted when reconstructingu 0 d. Equation system (1) contains four unknowns T 11, T 12, T 21, T 22 but only two equations, which explains why two independent acoustic states are needed. In most experiments, the two source method is used. Here, the two loads method is retained. Both methods are based on the same physical pro- cess, namely a modiﬁcation of one or more acoustic boundary conditions. For reactive conditions, the two loads used in this study consist of an exhaust tube of length L ¼ 220 mm and the same exhaust tube with a perforated plate added at the top of it. For nonreactive conditions, the ﬁrst load consists again of an exhaust tube of length L ¼ 220 mm, whereas the second load makes use of two exhaust tubes with a total length of L ¼ 440 mm. The conﬁgurations used in both cases are independent for all fre- quencies of interest. Large Eddy Simulation/System Identification Approaches Two different approaches are applied to obtain the scattering matrix for cold and hot conditions. First, in the direct approach, the scattering matrix is directly computed from the LES time series. Second, only the FTF is identiﬁed from LES generated time series data. The identiﬁed FTF is then coupled via the RH jump equations into a ROM of the passive combustor. The hot combustor scattering matrix is consequently obtained from the composed model. Before the individual approaches are described in detail, the LES setup and the SI method as used in both approaches are introduced. Large Eddy Simulation/System Identification Methodology. Compared to the studies of Polifke and coworkers, which were based on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulation, a compressible LES is used in the present study. Giauque et al showed that LES provides a better esti- mation of the time lag between heat release ﬂuctuations and upstream velocity ﬂuctuations than a RANS computation. Simi- larly, Tay-Wo-Chong et al stated that LES yields more accu- rate estimates of the FTF than unsteady RANS. The LES is performed with the solver AVBP. The fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved on an unstruc- tured grid consisting of approximately 19 million cells with a maximum cell size of 0.06 mm in the ﬂame region. The shaded area in Fig. 3 indicates the domain resolved by the LES. The rather complex geometry of the swirler shown in Fig.4 is fully resolved by the LES. No geometrical simpliﬁcations are applied. The six off-centered radial swirler vanes, which have a diameter of 6 mm, are resolved by approximately 18 cells in the diameter that are reﬁned toward the walls. In total, the section containing the swirler is resolved by about 4 million cells. For handling subgrid scales in the LES, the WALE model is applied due to its capacity to recover turbulent subscale sta- tistics in near wall regions. Turbulence–ﬂame interaction is taken into account by the dynamically thickened ﬂame model with seven cells resolving the laminar ﬂame thickness. The chemistry of the perfectly premixed methane/air ﬂame is described by a global two-step scheme. Nonreﬂecting boundary conditions are applied at the inlet and outlet by using plane wave masking. For further details and a proper validation of the LES setup, the reader is referred to Ref. Instead of computing discrete values of the scattering matrix or the FTF by forcing the ﬂow monofrequently and repeatedly over a certain frequency range, the ﬂow is forced with an acoustic broad- band signal. As forcing signal, a wavelet type signal is used, see Fig. 5. The forcing amplitude is set to 10% of the mean inlet velocity and the signal has a constant power spectral density and a low auto-correlation up to the cut-off frequency of approximately 800 Hz. Having no peak values in the broadband forcing signal above 10% of the mean inlet velocity ensures that the ﬂame response remains in the linear regime. Two independent data sets with a respective time series length of 350 ms are created. The chosen time series length of 350 ms represents a compromise. Generally, longer time series yield a more accurate identiﬁcation but are also computationally more expensive. A value of 350 ms results thus from best practice as it allows a proper and robust identiﬁcation with reasonable computational effort. For the ﬁrst data set, the acoustic forcing signal is applied at the inlet (fu) and the resulting signals are extracted from the measurement planes P 1 (gu) and P 2 (fd). The second data set is generated analogously by applying a downstream forcing (gd) and measuring the time series (gu, fd). From the generated time series data, models can be identiﬁed that relate respective inputs and outputs. Depending on the choice of input and output signals, the four scattering matrix coefﬁcients or the FTF can be identiﬁed. In both cases, every transfer expres- sion is modeled by a causal FIR, which relates present outputs to prior inputs. Note that for a noncausal system represen- tation, as, e.g. the transfer matrix, a noncausal FIR model needs to be applied that requires both prior and future inputs in order to estimate the model output. The causal FIR model reads as yðtÞ¼ Xnb i¼0 bi xðt /C 0 i DtÞþ eðtÞ (5) Herein, the model outputy(t) is computed by convoluting the prior inputs x(t – i Dt) and the FIR coefﬁcientsbi. The number of prior input samples that are taken into account via the impulse coefﬁ- cients bi and thus the length of the FIR are speciﬁed by the model order nb. Conversely, this means that the model ordernb deter- mines how many model FIR coefﬁcientsbi have to be estimated from the time series data. The higher the chosen model ordernb, the longer the time series needed for an accurate and robust identi- ﬁcation of the respective FIR coefﬁcientsbi. The terme(t) repre- sents a white noise perturbation on the outputy(t). Direct Approach for Scattering Matrix. In the direct approach, the characteristic wavesf and g are extracted from the LES measurement planes P 1 and P 2, see Fig.3. These two mea- surement planes coincide with the inlet and the outlet of the LES domain and contain all combustor parts shown in Fig. 3 in between them. Note that the location of the downstream measure- ment ME 00 does not coincide with the measurement plane P 2 in the LES domain. This discrepancy stems from the fact that the Fig. 5 Forcing signal: time series (left) and spectral distribu- tions (right) 021035-4 / Vol. 141, FEBRUARY 2019 Transactions of the ASME Reproduction of Papers M.

However, the need in the current study of properly measuring the acoustic ﬂuctuations downstream requires the test rig to be equipped with an additional pipe that contains the mounted microphones ME, ME 0, and ME 00 (see Fig.3). Since the additional pipe has a constant cross section area, its only effect on the measured acoustic waves is the introduction of an additional time lag compared to the plane P 2. To take this into account and to guarantee a proper comparison between measurements and numerical results, the numerically extracted time series in the direct approach are shifted by the aforementioned time lag in a ﬁrst postprocessing step. This has an inﬂuence on the phase of the computed scattering matrix coefﬁcients from the direct approach. The time lag Dt can be computed via the distance between the numerical measurement plane P 2 and the microphone ME 00 Dx ¼ 0.0085 m and the respective speed of soundcc (nonreactive case) orch (reactive case). In order to separate acoustic from tur- bulent ﬂuctuations, a characteristics-based ﬁlter is applied, which improves the quality of the SI. Flame dynamics, ﬂame- acoustic interactions, as well as acoustic propagation in the com- plex combustor geometry are directly resolved by the LES. From the upstream forced data set, the scattering matrix coefﬁcients S 11 and S 21, which describe the reﬂection and transmission of charac- teristic waves impinging from upstream, are directly identiﬁed via the SI procedure. Analogously, the coefﬁcients S 12 and S 22 are estimated from the data set with downstream forcing applied. In theory, it is also possible to get the four scattering matrix coef- ﬁcients from one single data set, in which independent upstream and downstream forcing is applied simultaneously. Although this technique yielded accurate results for cold conditions, unsatisfac- tory results were obtained in the reactive case for a time series length of 350 ms. One possible reason might be that the generated time series was too short in the reactive case for the simultaneously identiﬁcation of all four scattering matrix coefﬁcients. Moreover, other than in the nonreactive case, combustion noise corrupts the time series data. This means that acoustic ﬂuctuations, generated by turbulent velocity perturbations impinging on the ﬂame front, over- lay the forced ﬂame response resulting from the acoustic broadband forcing. It is emphasized that this issue applies not only for a broad- band forcing method but also in cases of a monofrequent forcing of the ﬂow. The totally recorded acoustic ﬂuctuations may thus be dis- tinguished into two contributions: First, a contribution that results from the acoustic forcing and second, a contribution that stems from turbulent combustion noise. Note, the second contribution is by deﬁnitionuncorrelated to the deterministic ﬂame response and hinders thus the identiﬁcation in hot conditions [ 16]. For consistency, two independent data sets (upstream and downstream forcing) are thus used in the current study for both reactive and nonreactive conditions. F l a m e T r a n s f e r F u n c t i o n 1 Reduced Order Model Approach. The ROM is based on a linear acoustic network model as it was used, e.g. in Refs. and. It describes the main elements of the combustor and is implemented in the open-source acoustic network tool ta X. The model is depicted in Fig.6. The geo- metrical and thermodynamical parameters of the ROM are sum- marized in Table 1. Every element of the linear network model is deﬁned by a 2/C 2 2 transfer matrix that relates the upstream characteristic wavesfu and gu to the characteristic wavesfd and gd downstream of the ele- ment. Note that instead of using a network model based on trans- fer matrices, the respective elements could also be described equivalently by their scattering matrix. The connection of two ele- ments would then be either realized by using the Redheffer Star- Product, which combines two scattering matrices to form an overall scattering matrix through simple algebraic combination of the respective subelements, or by converting the scattering matri- ces into a transfer matrix representation before connecting them by simple concatenation. Duct sections like the injection tube or the convergent part downstream of the combustion chamber only introduce a time lag between the upstream and the downstream characteristic waves and are described as fd gd /C 20/C 21 ¼ e/C 0 ixl=c 0 0 eixl=c /C 20/C 21 fu gu /C 20/C 21 (6) with x as angular frequency,l as respective duct length, andc as the mean speed of sound in the respective duct section. The area jumps within the network model are described in a simplistic manner fd gd /C 20/C 21 ¼ 1 þ Au=Ad 1 /C 0 Au=Ad 1 /C 0 Au=Ad 1 þ Au=Ad /C 20/C 21 fu gu /C 20/C 21 (7) wherein Au/Ad describes the area ratio from upstream to down- stream section. The area jumps are assumed to be loss free and have no end correction. Since the complex radial swirler geometry is only insufﬁciently approximated by simple duct and area jump elements, it is replaced by a 2/C 2 2 scattering matrix that is converted into a trans- fer matrix representation. The swirler scattering matrix is Fig. 6 Reduced order model: the swirler is replaced by an identiﬁed scattering matrix Table 1 Summary of the geometrical and thermodynamical parameters used in the ROM Injection tube Flame Comb. chamber Convergent linj ¼ 0.0034 m Tc ¼ 293 K lcc ¼ 0.0154 m lconv ¼ 0.0185 m Ainj ¼ 3.052 /C 2 10/C 0 4 m 2 Th ¼ 1550 K Acc ¼ 6.073 /C 2 10/C 0 3 m 2 Aconv ¼ 3.032 /C 2 10/C 0 4 m 2 uinj ¼ 7.01 m/s qc ¼ 1.0205 kg/m 3 qh ¼ 0.0235 kg/m 3 Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power FEBRUARY 2019, Vol. 141/ 021035-5 A.4 P APER -SM, J.

From the generated time series, the scattering matrix is determined via SI techniques. For brevity, the resulting swirler scattering matrix is not explicitly shown here. The FTF is identiﬁed from a time series of velocity ﬂuctuations at the reference positionu 0 ref, which coincides with the experimen- tal reference position as shown in Fig.3, and total heat release rate ﬂuctuations _Q 0, both extracted from the upstream forced data set F xðÞ ¼ _Q = _Q u 0 ref=u (8) The comparison between the experimentally measured FTF and the one deduced from the LES/SI approach is depicted in Fig.7. The error bars for the measured FTF are deduced from three experimental data sets for the same operating conditions and rep- resent the maximum error in reproducibility of the experiment. The model order of the identiﬁed FTF is equal tonb ¼ 30. In the following step, the identiﬁed FTF is coupled into the ROM via the linearized RH equations that describe the jump con- ditions across a thin zone of heat release at low Mach number p 0 d ¼ p 0 u (9 a) u 0 d ¼ u 0 u þ c /C 0 1ðÞ cp A _Q (9 b) where c represents the heat capacity ratio and A the cross section area of the ﬂame region.

The coupling of the FTF into the ROM is indicated by the addi- tional arrow in Fig.6. Note that this coupling approach only holds if certain constraints are respected: (1) The ﬂame is assumed to be compact with respect to the acoustic wavelength considered. (2) Inﬂuence of pressure ﬂuctuations on the ﬂame response is insigniﬁcant. For the given working conditions, the ﬂame length is aboutlf /C 25 0.004 m. The scattering matrices are evaluated in the low frequency region up to a frequency of 400 Hz resulting in a maximum Helmholtz number of He< 0.005. The Helmholtz num- ber is thus much smaller than unity, implying that the ﬂame may be assumed to be acoustically compact. As mentioned in the experimental description, methane and air are already premixed before their injection into the plenum. For perfectly premixed ﬂames, velocity sensitivity is a valid assumption. From these considerations, it is concluded that the FTF þROM approach should provide valid predictions for the scattering matrix coefﬁ- cients in the hot conﬁguration. Results First, the combustor scattering matrix from experiment, the direct approach, and the ROM prediction are compared for the cold case. This validates the LES/SI procedure and the ROM of the cold combustor to a certain extent and derives the results of the reactive case on a solid basis. In a second step, the hot conﬁgu- ration is investigated. Nonreactive Case. Figure 8 depicts the four scattering matrix coefﬁcients deduced from experiment, the direct LES approach without combustion, and the ROM prediction for the cold conﬁguration. In the ROM, the downstream temperature Th is set equal to the upstream temperature Tc resulting inh ¼ 0. The second term on the r.h.s in Eq.(10) thus vanishes: the ﬂame does not have any inﬂuence. In the direct approach, the model order for each of the four scattering matrix coefﬁcients is set tonb ¼ 10. The conﬁdence intervals for the direct approach that come from the SI procedure are not shown in Fig.8. Due to the low model order of nb ¼ 10 and the high signal-to-noise ratio, the 95% Fig. 7 Comparison between measured FTF with respective error bars and FTF from LES/SI.

In Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, 2018. Reprinted with permission from ASME. conﬁdence intervals of the estimated scattering coefﬁcients are very small and could hardly be recognized in Fig.8. Considering the two reﬂection coefﬁcients S 12 and S 21 as well as S 11, i.e. the transmission coefﬁcients from upstream to down- stream all three methods are in fairly good agreement. In particu- lar, the phase matches excellently. On the other hand, the absolute values exhibit subtle differences. In contrast to the ROM, the direct LES approach takes acoustic losses into account. Therefore, the coefﬁcients’ magnitudes obtained by the direct LES approach are slightly smaller than the ones from the ROM. It can be observed that the magnitude of the transmission coefﬁcient from downstream to upstream S 22 exceeds unity for low frequencies. This results from the cross section area ratio between downstream measurement plane P 2 and the upstream measurement plane P 1 that is also above unity, see Fig.3. Due to mass conservation, the ratio gu/gd, which is exactly described by the S 22 coefﬁcient, becomes larger than unity. For the same reason, the transmission coefﬁcient S 11 is distinctively below unity. The magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcients S 12 and S 21 is of order unity. This strong reﬂection within the combustor geometry is caused by the large area jump between the injection tube and the combustion cham- ber, denoted as “area jump 1” in Fig.6. An evaluation of its scat- tering behavior, see Eq.(7), shows that the largest parts of the incoming waves are reﬂected, whereas only a small part is trans- mitted across the area jump. Even though the phase of all three methods matches well for the transmission coefﬁcient S 22, the var- iations measured in the absolute value are observed neither by the direct LES approach nor by the ROM. This discrepancy might be caused by inaccuracies in describing the acoustic transmission from the combustion chamber into the injection tube. However, the general trend and the magnitude ofj S 22 j are in fairly good agreement for all three methods. To show the effect of the swirler scattering matrix within the ROM, it was replaced by a simple duct element having the same length as the swirler element, see in Fig.8. Compared to the ROM containing the swirler scattering matrix, a larger devi- ation to experimental results and to the direct approach is observ- able. It can be concluded that the use of a nontrivial swirler scattering matrix increases the accuracy of the ROM. Overall, several conclusion may be drawn from the results of the cold conﬁguration: (1) The compressible LES correctly describes the acoustic propagation within the complex combustor geometry, allowing the LES/SI procedure to extract all four scat- tering matrix coefﬁcients from the broadband time series data over a range of frequencies. (2) The ROM based on a linear net- work model is able to correctly reproduce the main features of the cold scattering matrix. This means that the passive combustor parts are modeled by the ROM with sufﬁcient accuracy, despite the simpliﬁcations made such as 1 D acoustics or the simpliﬁed geometry. (3) The area jump between injection tube and combus- tion chamber reﬂects most of the incoming waves. (4) The swirler is acoustically not completely transparent. (5) The direct LES approach and the ROM correctly capture the time lag between ingoing and outgoing characteristic waves as the phase is in excel- lent agreement with experimental measurements. This in turn means that the time lag correction due to the differing measure- ment locations in experiment and direct approach is valid and yields satisfying results. Conclusions (1) to (5) put the following study of the hot conﬁg- uration on a solid basis and allow to exclude some reasons for any discrepancies between the methods in the reactive conﬁguration. Reactive Case. Figure 9 shows the scattering matrix coefﬁ- cients for the reactive conﬁguration obtained by experiment, the direct LES approach with combustion, the FTFþROM approach, and a ROM withpassive ﬂame. In the last case, the temperature increase across the ﬂame is taken into account, but the unsteady heat release as represented by the FTF is not, i.e. the ﬂame is inactive. For the direct approach, the FIR model order is now increased to nb ¼ 30 for each of the four scattering matrix coefﬁcients, as the presence of the ﬂame results in a more complex scattering behavior and the ﬂame time lag is quite large compared to acoustic scales. The direct and the FTFþROM approaches yield results for the four scattering matrix coefﬁcients that are largely consistent with each other and show overall satisfactory agreement with measure- ments. However, the downstream reﬂection coefﬁcient S 12 (top- right subplot) exhibits pronounced discrepancies between the numerical results and experiment, especially in the low-frequency region. A possible explanation for the discrepancy might be that the acoustic signals in experiment as well as in LES are overlaid by combustion noise emitted from the turbulent ﬂame, which is known to be active predominantly in the low-frequency region. One should expect that combustion noise is most detrimental for determination of the S 12 coefﬁcient, since it describes reﬂection of a wavegd coming from downstream into a wavefd propagating in the downstream direction. For the determination of this coefﬁ- cient, both signals are extracted downstream of the ﬂame in the combustion chamber, where combustion noise amplitudes higher than in the plenum must be expected.2 Consistently, the measure- ment variation observed is largest in the S 12 coefﬁcient. Note that forcing amplitudes should not be increased arbitrarily, in order to avoid a nonlinear ﬂame response. A decrease in the signal-to-noise is thus unavoidable, which worsens the reliability of the SI results. Indeed, the conﬁdence intervals of the scattering coefﬁcient S 12 estimated with the direct approach are quite wide, see Fig. 9(b). However, the conﬁdence intervals are not wide enough to account for the discrepancies between simulation and experiment. One should also consider that in the experiments, the acquisition time per frequency measurement was ﬁxed. Thus, measurements for higher frequencies are statistically more Fig. 9 Combustor scattering matrix for hot conditions. Experi- ment, direct LES approach and FTF 1 ROM and ROM with passive ﬂame.

The signal-to-noise ratio is thus favorable in this case, yielding reliable results also for S 12.

Indeed, the agreement between numerical predictions and measurements improves with frequency. Conversely, with decreasing forcing frequency, fewer and fewer cycles were recorded and agreement deteriorates. Dif- ferences in measurement principle—two-source with broad-band forcing and nonreﬂection boundary conditions in LES/SI versus two-load with monofrequent forcing and partial reﬂection in experiment—may also contribute to the discrepancies. The 95% conﬁdence intervals shown for the FTF þROM approach are determined by propagating the uncertainties in FTF magnitude (see Fig.7) through the ROM. By comparing the width of conﬁdence intervals obtained with the FTFþROM approach, it becomes evident that in particular the upstream transmission coef- ﬁcient S 11 exhibits signiﬁcant uncertainties. The interpretation of this behavior is the following: If the ﬂow is forced upstream, sig- niﬁcant velocity perturbations are generated at the reference posi- tion, see Fig. 6. Via the FTF and the RH coupling, these ﬂuctuations cause acoustic waves at the ﬂame position, see Eq. (10). On the other hand, due to the aforementioned reﬂective area jump in between the injection tube and the combustion cham- ber (area jump 1 in Fig.6), only a small part of the initial forcing signal reaches the outlet of the combustor. It follows that the sig- nal at the outlet should be dominated by the acoustic waves gener- ated at the ﬂame position caused by velocity perturbations at the reference position. These arguments are corroborated by the fol- lowing observations: (1)S 11 as predicted by the ROM with pas- sive ﬂame differs strongly from the prediction with active ﬂame, (2) the magnitude of S 11 shows a similar succession of local maxima and minima as the FTF at corresponding frequencies, (3) the phase of S 11 is dominated by the ﬂame time lag and not by the acoustic scales (as it is the case for the ROM with passive ﬂame). Consequently, uncertainties in FTF identiﬁcation impact notice- ably the prediction of the S 11 transmission coefﬁcient. The impact of the ﬂame dynamics on the remaining scattering coefﬁcients is weaker. The coefﬁcients are closer in magnitude to the predictions of the ROM with passive ﬂame while the phase is dominated by acoustic time scales and matches thus the phase of the ROM with passive ﬂame. This can be explained again through the reﬂective area jump between the injection tube and the combustion chamber. If the ﬂow is forced from downstream, only a small portion of the acoustic forcing signal reaches the ref- erence position upstream, since the largest part of the signal is reﬂected at the area jump. Accordingly, the contribution of the ﬂame generated acoustic waves remains relatively small. The impact of the ﬂame on the scattering coefﬁcients S 12 and S 22 is only moderate. The same holds for the upstream reﬂection coefﬁ- cient S 21. Even though the ﬂame response is considerable—the upstream acoustic forcing directly causes velocity perturbations at the reference position—only a small part of the upstream traveling acoustic waves generated at the ﬂame position reach again the upstream end of the combustor. To conclude, uncertainties in the determination of the scattering coefﬁcients in the FTFþROM approach are largest, where the ﬂame modulates the passive scattering matrix the most. Summary and Conclusions The aim of this paper is a one-to-one comparison between two alternative numerical approaches for deducing the scattering matrix of a turbulent swirl combustor under nonreactive as well as reactive conditions. The respective approaches combine LES, SI and ROM. Numerical results for thecold and hot combustor scat- tering matrix are compared against each other and against experi- ment. The ﬁrst approach identiﬁes scattering matrix coefﬁcients directly from broadband time series data that are generated by a compressible LES with broadband forcing. The second approach identiﬁes only the FTF from the compressible LES, which is then coupled into a ROM of the combustor acoustics via the RH equa- tions in order to compose the scattering matrix. The results for the nonreactive scattering matrix show excellent agreement between simulation and experiment. This suggests that the 1 D acoustic assumption made in the ROM is justiﬁed. More- over, it becomes evident that the radial swirler is acoustically not completely transparent. Consequently, the use of nontrivial swir- ler scattering matrix further increases the accuracy of the ROM. The scattering matrices for the reactive setup also exhibit satis- factory agreement, even though the downstream reﬂection coefﬁ- cient S 12 shows a distinct discrepancy between the numerical predictions—which coincide with each other—and the measure- ments. Possible reasons for the discrepancies are the small signal- to-noise ratio of the time series data extracted in the burnt gas region and the ﬁnite time series length available. In the direct approach, a ﬁnite time series length introduces uncertainties in the identiﬁcation process in particular at low frequencies, in experi- ment fewer cycles can be recorded for low forcing frequencies due to the ﬁxed acquisition time. Nonetheless, considering the good agreement between the two quite different numerical approaches and the overall good agreement with the measurements of the nonreactive and the reactive scattering matrix, it is princi- pally shown that both numerical approaches are capable of deter- mining the scattering matrix of a complex combustor. Moreover, the comparison to the ROM with a passive ﬂame highlights the impact of the ﬂame on the acoustic scattering matrix of the combus- tor. It is shown that the transmission coefﬁcient from upstream to downstream S 11 is dominated by the ﬂame dynamics, i.e. the FTF. The composed approach yields accurate results, as long as the constraints of the coupling between FTF and ROM via the Rankine–Hugoniot equations are respected. The perfectly premixed ﬂame investigated in this study is indeed predominantly velocity sen- sitive and acoustically compact. One may conclude that the other simpliﬁcations implied by the composed approach, such as 1 D acoustics or a constant temperature distribution in the hot gas region, do not introduce signiﬁcant errors. The applicability of the composed approach in this case would allow the computationally efﬁcient determination of the combustor scattering matrix for a wide parame- ter space, as changes could be easily implemented in the ROM. However, there are situations in which the constraints of the com- posed approach are no longer respected. The mixture might be tech- nically premixed introducing a pressure sensitivity of the ﬂame or the ﬂame might be no longer acoustically compact. In these situa- tions, the more general direct LES approach would be necessary to accurately predict the reactive scattering matrix, as it allows to drop the constraints of the composed approach. All relevant mechanisms are directly resolved within the compressible LES. The comparisons and analysis carried out in this study thus pro- vide valuable insight to which extent both numerical methods yield coinciding results for a conﬁguration, where the composed approach is applicable.

The analysis is based on the understanding that sound is generated by unsteady heat release resulting from turbulent ﬂuctuations on the one hand, and from the response of the ﬂame to incoming acoustic perturbations on the other. The former effect is described by a source term for combustion noise, i.e. a spectral distribution of unsteady heat release rate, the latter by the ﬂame transfer function. Both quantities are identiﬁed from time series data for ﬂuctuating velocity and heat release rate, generated with large eddy simulation of premix swirl burner. The combustion noise source term and the ﬂame transfer function are then introduced in an acoustic network model of the test rig in order to compute the spectral distribution of the sound pressure level at a certain location in the combustion chamber. Results for the noise spectrum are in good agreement with experiment, showing a broadband component and well-deﬁned peaks. The frequencies of the peaks correspond to either acoustic cavity or ITA resonances. The acoustic network model is used for parametric studies, where the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcient at the combustor exit is varied. Remarkably, it is found that the magnitude of the ITA peak increases with decreasing values of the acoustic reﬂection coeﬃcient, and vice versa. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of combustion chamber length on resonance frequencies is explored. It is observed that the frequency of the ITA resonance is insensitive to combustor length. This behaviour is observed qualitatively also in experiments. ©2 0 1 7 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Combustion noise results from unsteady volumetric expansion generated by ﬂuctuations of the heat release rate. A turbu- lent ﬂame should be considered as a broad-band source of com- bustion noise, with a spectral distribution that is governed by the length and time scales of the turbulent reacting ﬂow ﬁeld. In the case of enclosed ﬂames, it is well understood that resonances with acoustic eigenmodes of the enclosure will lead to peaks in the spectral distribution of pressure ﬂuctuations [3–5]. Moreover, it is to be expected that acoustic waves generated by unsteady heat re- lease are reﬂected at the acoustic boundaries, such that they sub- sequently perturb the ﬂame. It is not always appreciated that this feedback from the acoustics to the ﬂame generates a two-way cou- pling, which may modify the strength of resonance peaks, or give rise to additional resonances between the source of combustion noise and the combustor acoustics [6–11]. ∗ Corresponding author.

Intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback has only recently been identiﬁed as a ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interaction mechanism that can give rise to important and sometimes paradoxical effects in com- bustion dynamics. The structure of the ITA feedback loop was ex- plained by Bomberg et al as follows: ﬂuctuations of the heat release rate radiate acoustic waves in both the downstream and upstream directions. The upstream traveling wave perturbs the ve- locity ﬁeld upstream of the ﬂame, which subsequently will inﬂu- ence the heat release produced by the ﬂame, especially so for pre- mixed ﬂames, which are velocity sensitive. The acoustic ﬁelds in combustion chamber and plenum are not part of this feedback loop. Intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback adds corresponding ITA modes to the spectrum of thermoacoustic eigenmodes, which need not lock on to acoustic eigenmodes of a combustor. Re- markably, simple low-order models suggest that ITA modes may be unstable even in anechoic conﬁgurations [15–17]. Such insta- bilities have been observed in numerical simulations of laminar ﬂames, corroborated by experiment on laminar and tur- bulent ﬂames [12–14]. Furthermore ITA feedback can cause pro- nounced peaks in the acoustic response and the instability poten- tiality of premixed ﬂames. http://dx.doi.org/10.01016/j.combustﬂame.2017.004.0015 0010-2180/© 2017 The Combustion Institute.

Silva et al / Combustion and Flame 182 269–278 Fig. 1. Schematic representation of Eq. (1). A turbulent ﬂame is considered as an element that transmits and reﬂects incoming acoustic waves f u, g d and in addition generates acoustic waves f s, g s. Overall, the outgoing waves f d, g u result from scat- tering, i.e. transmission and reﬂection, plus generation of sound. The present paper investigates the contribution of ITA feed- back to the spectral distribution of combustion noise generated by an enclosed, turbulent ﬂame. It is found that resonance peaks in the combustion noise spectrum of a conﬁned, turbulent, premixed, swirl ﬂame can be related to either acoustic cavity modes, or the ITA feedback loop. The analysis is based on the understanding that turbulent ﬂuctuations will perturb the heat release rate of a ﬂame and thereby give rise to a combustion noise source term and a corresponding acoustic source vector. The former is quantiﬁed in terms of the spectral distribution of ﬂuctuations of overall heat re- lease rate, the latter in terms of the strength of acoustic waves that travel away from the ﬂame in the down- and upstream directions, respectively. In order to capture the two-way coupling described above, the response of the ﬂame to upstream velocity perturba- tions is described in terms of the ﬂame transfer function. More- over, the acoustic properties of the combustor –s p e e d of sound, length of plenum, burner and combustion chamber, reﬂection co- eﬃcients, etc. –s h a p e the spectral distribution of pressure ﬂuc- tuations and must also be taken into account in order to predict combustion noise. This paper is organized as follows: The next section explains how a turbulent ﬂame may be characterized acoustically by a combustion noise source term, as introduced above, plus the ﬂame transfer function. The third section describes the combus- tion system under investigation, while the fourth section exposes a methodology, previously suggested by Silva et al, to ob- tain both the combustion noise source term and the ﬂame transfer function from time series data generated by Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of combustion, with broad-band acoustic excitation and non- reﬂecting boundary conditions. Subsequently in the ﬁfth and sixth section, an acoustic network model with combustion noise source term is presented and the proper interpretation of the solutions of this model is discussed. Finally, the sound pressure level spectrum of combustion noise produced at a location close to the outlet of the combustor under investigation is estimated. This is achieved by implementing the acoustic network model of the combustion test rig under study, including the previously obtained ﬂame response and noise source. A careful analysis shows that one of the reso- nance peaks exhibited by the noise spectrum results from ITA feed- back. Its frequency is independent of both the combustion cham- ber length of the system and its acoustic boundary conditions. Re- sults are satisfactorily compared against experiment. 2. Acoustic characterization of a turbulent ﬂame As discussed above, the acoustic characteristics of a turbulent ﬂame can be described by coeﬃcients of transmission and reﬂec- tion of incoming acoustic waves on the one hand, and a source term for combustion noise on the other, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Schuermans et al and Paschereit et al express this concept mathematically as follows: [ f d g u ] = [ S 11 S 12 S 21 S 22 ]    Acoustic Scattering [ f u g d ] + [ f s g s ],    Acoustic source vector (1) where f and g denote acoustic waves traveling in the down- and upstream directions, respectively. The indices d, u and s stand for ‘downstream of the ﬂame’, ‘upstream of the ﬂame’, and ‘acous- tic source’, i.e. acoustic waves produced by unsteady heat release driven by turbulent ﬂuctuations. The coeﬃcients S ij of the scat- tering matrix, as observed in Fig. 1, may be interpreted as coef- ﬁcients of transmission and reﬂection of incoming acoustic waves f u, g d. For an acoustically compact ﬂame, the scattering matrix co- eﬃcients S ij depend on mean ﬂow properties such as temperature, density and speed of sound up- and downstream of the ﬂame, re- spectively, and on the response of the ﬂame to ﬂow perturbations, which may be expressed in terms of the ﬂame transfer function (FTF). The fundamental premise of the model expressed in Eq. (1) is that the acoustic source vector manifested by the acoustic waves f s, g s is uncorrelated with the incoming acoustic waves f u and g d. This assumption is reasonable, because the source of combustion noise can be considered as random process driven by the stochas- tic activity of the turbulent ﬂow, resulting in corresponding turbu- lent unsteadiness of heat release. The description of the ﬂame acoustics given by Eq. (1) can be introduced in an acoustic network model to evaluate the acoustic pressure at given locations of the system, provided that both the scattering matrix co- eﬃcients S ij and the acoustic source vector f s and g s are known. Lavrentjev et al and Paschereit et al discuss techniques to obtain these quantities experimentally by using two or three inde- pendent acoustic states. In keeping with the concept expressed in Fig. 1 and Eq. (1), the present study distinguishes between two contributions to the global unsteady heat release rate ˙ Q ′ : ﬁrstly a term ˙ Q ′ c, which re- sults from incoming acoustic waves and can be related to upstream velocity perturbations u ′ ref by the FTF F(ω), and secondly a term ˙ Q ′ s that is uncorrelated with incoming acoustic perturbations. As- suming harmonic oscillations, with [ ] ′ = ˆ [ ] e iωt, we express ˆ ˙ Q(ω) as ˆ ˙ Q(ω) ¯˙ Q = ˆ ˙ Q c (ω) / ¯˙ Q    F(ω) ˆ u ref ¯u ref    Flame response + ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) ¯˙ Q    Comb. noise source (2) where ¯[ ] represents the temporal average of a quantity, and u ref stands for the velocity at a reference position upstream of the ﬂame. Note that there may be cases where the global heat release rate ˆ ˙ Q is not strongly inﬂuenced by the incoming acoustic waves, such that ˆ ˙ Q ≈ ˆ ˙ Q s, see e.g. It will be shown, however, that it is mandatory to account for the complete description of ˆ ˙ Q accord- ing to Eq. (2) in order to capture the resonance associated with two-way coupling and ITA feedback. 3. Combustion test rig with BRS burner A schematic of the swirl-stabilized combustor investigated in this study is shown in Fig. 2.

The BRS burner itself is simply an an- nular ﬂow passage formed by a bluff body with an outer diameter of 16 mm, and a duct with an inner diameter of 40 mm. An ax- ial swirler with eight vanes and characterized by a swirl number equal to 0.074 is mounted on the bluff body, see Fig. 2. The ﬂame is stabilized predominantly by the central recirculation zone down- stream of the bluff body, which is strong thanks to the swirl im- posed on the ﬂow. This test-rig was investigated experimentally by Komarek and Polifke, who studied and modeled the response of a premixed swirl ﬂame to swirl ﬂuctuations. The burner was operated under perfectly premixed conditions of methane and air with an equiva- lence ratio φ = 0. 77 and a range of thermal power between 30 k W and 70 k W. For different swirler positions the ﬂame transfer func- tion F(ω) and the respective noise spectra were measured. The experimental validation data used in the present work always refer to operating conditions of 30 k W thermal power, with the swirler mounted at a position l 4 = 45 mm upstream of the burner mouth. The combustor outlet is equipped with a perforated plate, which reduces the magnitude of the downstream acoustic reﬂec- tion coeﬃcient r out below unity, see Fig. 3. Unfortunately, the mea- sured values of the reﬂection coeﬃcient exhibit considerable un- certainty. Consequently, in this study we deﬁne a ‘reference’ case with constant absolute value of the reﬂection coeﬃcient | r out | equal to 0.07 (red line in Fig. 3 ). The phase is approximated by a linear dependence on frequency, with a slope that ﬁts measure- ment values quite well in the range of frequencies of interest. LES of the BRS burner at the aforementioned operating condi- tions was performed by Tay-Wo-Chong et al using the numer- Fig. 4.

The inter- action between turbulence and combustion were modeled by the dynamically thickened ﬂame model. The walls were consid- ered non-adiabatic, whereas the inlet and outlet boundaries were made to be acoustically non-reﬂecting. For that purpose Navier Stokes characteristic boundary conditions with characteristic based ﬁltering and plane wave masking were accounted for. Besides mean velocity and mean heat release distributions, the FTF F(ω) was identiﬁed and compared to experimental measurements. 4. System identiﬁcation Time series data of u ′ = [ u ′ 0, u ′ N ] at the reference position ‘ref’ (see Fig. 2 ) and of the global heat release rate ˙ Q ′ = [ ˙ Q ′ 0, ˙ Q ′ N ] were generated with LES over a time intervall of 0.035 s at a sam- pling rate of 800 k HZ by Tay-Wo-Chong et al. The present study makes use of this LES data. In view of System Identiﬁcation, these signals, displayed in Fig. 4, are down-sampled to a rate of 2200 Hz. It should be remarked that u ′ is obtained after applying Characteristic Based Filtering to velocity ﬁelds at four adja- cent, transversal planes in order to remove perturbations that are not of acoustic nature. In the following, we will summarize how Tay-Wo-Chong et al obtained the ﬂame transfer function F(ω) by correlation analysis of this data. Furthermore, we will show how the combus- tion noise source term ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) over the entire frequency range of interest can be also estimated from the same data set. 4.01. Identiﬁcation of ﬂame transfer function F(ω) The linear ﬂame response to incoming acoustic perturbations can be modeled either by the FTF in frequency domain (see ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. (2) ) or by a Finite Impulse Re- sponse (FIR) model in the time domain. Both methods are fundamentally equivalent. In the FIR model, the input signal u ′ is convoluted with the impulse response h to create the output ˙ Q ′ c. If any (uncorrelated) noise ˙ Q ′ s is present, it is added to the ﬂame re- sponse, such that for a discrete times t = n /Delta 1 t ˙ Q ′ n ¯˙ Q = ¯u ( h 0 u ′ n + h 1 u ′ n −1 + ···+ h n h u ′ n −n h ) + ˙ Q ′ s,n ¯˙ Q, (3) where h k denotes the coeﬃcients of the impulse response h. Note that the subscript ‘ref’ in the signal u ′ has been dropped to ease readability. In compact form one writes ˙ Q ′ n ¯˙ Q = ¯u n h ∑ k =0 h k u ′ n −k + ˙ Q ′ s,n ¯˙ Q, n = n h, N (4) A.5 P APER -2 WAY, Combust. Flame With permission from C. Silva, M. Merk, T. Komarek, and W.

Silva et al / Combustion and Flame 182 269–278 The impulse response h = [ h 0, h n h ] ⊺ may be estimated from time series data [ u ′ ], [ ˙ Q ′ ] by a suitable optimization technique. In the case of a FIR structure, a minimum-least-square method yields h = /Gamma 1−1 c, (5) where auto-correlation matrix /Gamma 1 and cross-correlation vector c are deﬁned as /Gamma 1 kl ≡ N ∑ n = n h u ′ n −k u ′ n −l k, l = 0, n h, (6) c k ≡ N ∑ n = n h u ′ n −k Q ′ n k = 0, n h. (7) Details are given by Polifke and references cited therein. In statistics and system identiﬁcation, the bias (or bias error) of an estimate is the difference between the true value and the expected value –i. e. the value that one obtains in the limit of an inﬁnitely long time series –o f the parameter being estimated. Eq. (5) is guaranteed to give an unbiased estimate of the impulse response h only if any stochastic contributions to the output are white noise. Combustion noise is in general colored noise, with a power spectral distribution related to turbulent statistics. Nevertheless, we argue that in the present case Eq. (5) gives a suﬃciently accurate estimate of the impulse response with a mi- nor bias. This argument is developed as follows: Recall ﬁrst that the source of combustion noise is described as a sum of correlated and stochastic contributions to unsteady heat release rate, ˙ Q ′ = ˙ Q ′ c + ˙ Q ′ s. Then consider that the LES of Tay-Wo-Chong et al employed non-reﬂecting boundary conditions, and thus the acoustic waves impinging upon the ﬂame were dominated by the imposed exci- tation signal. Furthermore, a fairly strong excitation with a signal- to-noise ratio larger than 10 was imposed (while maintaining lin- ear ﬂame dynamics). These circumstances ensure ﬁrstly that the source of noise ˙ Q ′ s is not strongly correlated with the upstream ve- locity u ′, and secondly that ˙ Q ′ s < ˙ Q ′ c. Rewriting Eq. (7) as c k = N ∑ n = n h u ′ n −k Q ′ c,n + N ∑ n = n b u ′ n −k Q ′ s,n, (8) it follows that in the present case the estimate of the cross- correlation vector c, cannot be strongly inﬂuenced by the noise source term ˙ Q ′ s, because the second term on the r.h.s. of the above equation is small. The impulse response is converted to the FTF F(ω) by the z - transform, F(ω) = n h ∑ k =0 h k e −i ωk /Delta 1 t, where ω ∈ C. (9) The frequency response of the ﬂame –i. e. the ﬂame transfer func- tion F(ω) evaluated for real-valued frequencies ω ∈ R –i s shown in Fig. 5. The agreement with experimental measurements, which employed harmonic forcing and did not rely on system identiﬁ- cation, is very good –i n particular at frequencies below 250 Hz, where the gain of the frequency response is signiﬁcant. This conﬁrms that in the present case the non-white character of the noise does not lead to a signiﬁcant bias in the estimation of the impulse response h and the source of noise ˙ Q ′ s. In closing this section it is remarked that there are model struc- tures such as the Box–Jenkins model, which model both the impulse response h and the noise source ˙ Q ′ s. The application of such advanced methods to the acoustic characterization of turbu- lent ﬂames with colored combustion noise is beyond the scope of the present study. Fig. 5.

Estimate of noise source ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) If an FIR model is used to estimate the impulse response h of the ﬂame –s e e Eq. (5) –t h e source of combustion noise ˙ Q ′ s may be estimated as the residual ˙ Q ′ s,n ¯˙ Q = ˙ Q ′ n ¯˙ Q − 1 ¯u n h ∑ k =0 h k u ′ n −k t = n h, N. (10) This simple estimate is justiﬁed by the premise that the com- bustion noise source term ˙ Q ′ s results from turbulent ﬂuctuations, which are uncorrelated with the acoustic excitation signal. Fur- thermore, in LES there are no other signiﬁcant sources of (mea- surement) noise, which could contribute to ﬂuctuations not repre- sented by the FIR model. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the noise source ˙ Q ′ s, here denoted S QQ and deﬁned as S QQ (ω) = 2/Delta 1 t N ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐ N−1 ∑ n =0 ˙ Q ′ s,n e −i ωn /Delta 1 t ⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐, (11) is then obtained by using Welch’s method with 16 Hamming Win- dows. The magnitude of the unitary discrete Fourier transform, ob- tained by means of LES data and shown in Fig. 6, is ﬁnally com- puted from S QQ as ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) = √ S QQ (ω) 2/Delta 1 t. (12) 5. Acoustic network model In this section we formulate a linear acoustic network model of the combustion test rig under investigation, with the objective of predicting the noise levels at a given location of the conﬁned system. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the downstream traveling acoustic wave Reproduction of Papers With permission from C. Silva, M. Merk, T. Komarek, and W. Polifke.

Silva et al / Combustion and Flame 182 269–278 273 f and upstream traveling acoustic wave g by f = ( ˆ p ¯ρ ¯c + ˆ u ) and g = ( ˆ p ¯ρ ¯c − ˆ u ). (13) The quantities p, u, ρ and c stand for pressure, velocity, density and sound speed, respectively. Let us also deﬁne a 2 × 2 transfer matrix T, which relates the acoustic waves f and g at a downstream location ‘d’ with respect to those at an upstream location ‘u’ as [ f d g d ] = T [ f u g u ]. (14) Note that instead of using a network model based on scattering matrices (as the one given by Eq. (1) ), we use here a network model based on transfer matrices, because it allows the assem- bly of multiple system elements by simple concatenation. We can acoustically describe the elements of the swirled burner (see in- dices in Fig. 2 ) by the corresponding acoustic transfer matrices T. The ducts ‘D’ are described by T D x,j = [ e −i ωl j / ¯c x 0 0 e i ωl j / ¯c x ], (15) where ‘x’ can take either a cold ‘c’ or a hot ‘h’ value, whereas the ﬁrst and second cross changes (‘AC 1’ and ‘AC 2’) are characterized by T AC 1 = [ 1 + α1 − ¯M in ζ 1 − α1 + ¯M in ζ 1 − α1 − ¯M in ζ 1 + α1 + ¯M in ζ ] (16) T AC 2 = [ 1 + α2 1 − α2 1 − α2 1 + α2 ] (17) where α1 = A P /A Mid and α2 = A Mid /A CC represent the area changes ‘1’ and ‘2’, respectively. The quantity ¯M stands for the Mach num- ber and ζ denotes a loss coeﬃcient. In a similar way, the swirler is acoustically described by T S = [ 2 − ¯M mid ζS ¯M mid ζS − ¯M mid ζS 2 + ¯M mid ζS ]. (18) The acoustic reﬂection at the inlet and outlet of the system are characterized, respectively, by R in = [ 1 −r in (ω) 0 0 ] and R out = [ 0 0 −r out (ω) 1 ], (19) where r in ( ω) and r out ( ω) represent the frequency depending re- ﬂection coeﬃcient. Note that we keep terms ¯M ζ for aero-acoustic losses, because they are of ﬁrst order in mean ﬂow Mach number ¯M, while we have neglected the contributions of non-zero Mach number on acoustic wave propagation in Eq. (15), because their ef- fect on the eigenfrequencies is only second order in Mach number. The plenum of the test rig is closed on the upstream side by a porous plate with high pressure loss, thus the inlet reﬂection coef- ﬁcient r in may be considered equal to unity for the entire range of frequencies. For the combustor exit coeﬃcient r out the ‘reference’ case from Fig. 3 is used. Let us now introduce the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across the ﬂame, which up to second order in Mach number read ˆ p df = ˆ p uf, (20) ˆ u df = ˆ u uf + (γ − 1) γ ¯p A CC ˆ ˙ Q(ω), (21) where γ stands for the heat capacity ratio, and ‘uf’ and ‘df’ rep- resents a location immediately ‘upstream’ or ‘downstream’ of the ﬂame, respectively. Inserting now the deﬁnition of f and g of Eq. Fig. 7. Schematic representation of Eq. (22). The ITA feedback loop is illustrated in orange, whereas acoustic waves are displayed in blue. The shaded region features the Flame as ˆ ˙ Q(ω) = ˆ ˙ Q c (ω) + ˆ ˙ Q s (ω). Empty blocks represent constant multiplica- tors. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). (13) in Eq. (20) and Eq. (21), and recalling that ˆ ˙ Q(ω) = ˆ ˙ Q c (ω) + ˆ ˙ Q s (ω), we obtain [ f df g df ] = [ ξ + 1 ξ − 1 ξ − 1 ξ + 1 ]    T PF [ f uf g uf ] + α2 θF(ω) [ 1 −1 −1 1 ]    T AF [ f ref g ref ] − S, (22) where we have introduced the sources S as S ≡ 1 (γ − 1) γ ¯p A CC ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) [ −1 ]. (23) Furthermore, ξ = ρc c c /ρh c h and θ = (T df /T uf − 1) denote the speciﬁc acoustic impedance and the relative temperature incre- ment, respectively. T PF stands for the transfer matrix of the “pas- sive ﬂame”, i.e. the temperature discontinuity across the ﬂame, while T AF denotes the ”active ﬂame” transfer matrix, i.e. the effect of unsteady ﬂame heat release in response to ﬂow perturbations. A schematic representation of Eq. (22) is given by Fig. 7. Note that in Eq. (22) the ﬂame transfer function is deﬁned with respect to the reference position ‘ref’ and not with respect to ‘uf’. We deﬁne now, considering the illustration of the system in Fig. 2, the transfer matrices ‘sys 1’, ‘sys 2’ and ‘SYS’ T sys 1 ≡ T D c, 2 T AC 1 T D c, 1, (24) T sys 2 ≡ T D c, 5 T AC 2 T D c, 4, T S T D c, 3 (25) T SYS ≡ ( T PF T sys 2 + T AF ) T sys 1, (26) and wave vectors W n ≡ [ f n g n ], (27) so that Eq. (22) may be written in compact form W df = T SYS W in − S. (28) Finally, system element transfer matrices, reﬂection coeﬃcients and the source S are assembled to form an inhomogeneous system of equations, ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ R in R out T SYS −I T D d, 6 −I T D d, 7 −I ⎤ ⎥ ⎦    M ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ W in W df W mic W out ⎤ ⎥ ⎦    x = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ S ⎤ ⎥ ⎦    b, (29) A.5 P APER -2 WAY, Combust.

In ﬁnishing this section is useful to remark that the acoustic source vector (see Eq. (1) ) is related to S by [ f s g s ] = 1 + ξ [ −ξ 0 0 1 ] S. (30) 6. Interpretation of solutions of the network model The inhomogeneous system of equations (29) may be written as M(ω) x = b(ω) for ω ∈ R. (31) The restriction to real-valued frequencies results from the combus- tion noise source term ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) contained in the vector b, which is deﬁned only for ω ∈ R. The vector of unknowns x –i. e. the charac- teristic wave amplitudes f n, g n at the network nodes –m a y be de- termined as x (ω) = M −1 (ω) b(ω), provided that the matrix M ( ω) at frequency ω is non-singular. The system (31) behaves in many aspects analogously to a forced oscillator, but some peculiarities result from the facts that the combustion noise source term is broad-band in nature; that thermo-acoustic system may develop self-excited instabilities due to feedback; and that nonlinear effects will become signiﬁcant at large oscillation amplitudes. Ramiﬁca- tions for the proper interpretation of peaks in the spectral distri- bution of pressure ﬂuctuations predicted by the model (31) result, which are discussed in this section. Consider ﬁrst that the inhomogeneous system of equations (31) will be ill-deﬁned with singular matrix M ( ω) for speciﬁc fre- quencies ω ∗, det (M(ω ∗)) = 0 with ω ∗ ∈ C. (32) These frequencies are associated with eigenmodes 1 of the corre- sponding homogeneous system M x = 0, with non-trivial eigenvec- tors x ∗ ̸ = 0. As discussed by Emmert et al, the complete set of eigenvectors of a thermoacoustic system M should be interpreted as the sum of cavity acoustic and ITA eigenmodes. If the imaginary part of an eigenfrequency is positive, imag( ω ∗) > 0, the amplitude 1 Note that this is not a standard linear algebra eigenvalue problem, because in general some of the coeﬃcients of the matrix M depend on frequency ω. Fig. 8. Association of resonant peaks in the SPL spectrum with the eigenfrequencies ω ∗ of the homogeneous system model. A source S with a PSD that is uniform in frequency is assumed. of that mode will decay ∼ exp {−imag (ω ∗) t}, and the mode is con- sidered stable. This is analogous to an oscillator without driving, where oscillation amplitude will decay due to friction. If the imagi- nary part of all eigenfrequencies is positive, the system M is judged to be linearly stable. Conversely, if imag( ω ∗) < 0 for one (or sev- eral) of the eigenmodes, the mode is thermoacoustically unstable and amplitudes will grow exponentially until nonlinear effects – such as saturation of ﬂame response, or increases losses – lead to an asymptotic state, e.g. a limit cycle. These considerations apply to both cavity acoustic and ITA modes. The case of exact marginal sta- bility with imag (ω ∗) = 0 is very unlikely and not considered fur- ther. Now let us discuss under which circumstances the model (31) will produce peaks in the spectral distribution of the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in the combustor. The ﬁrst possibility is that the spectral distribution of the combustion noise source term ˆ ˙ Q s and accordingly the acoustic source vector itself exhibit a peak at a certain frequency. For a linear system, enhanced forcing results in increased amplitudes, such that the SPL spectra should exhibit a corresponding peak at the same frequency. However, the spec- tral distribution of the combustion noise source term ˆ ˙ Q s is related to turbulent statistics, which in general will not generate pro- nounced peaks. A more relevant mechanism is resonant driving of a stable eigenmode. This scenario is straightforward to understand, in ob- vious analogy to a forced oscillator with damping, where for given forcing amplitude the amplitude of oscillation will increase as the forcing frequency approaches the oscillator eigenfrequency. Thus even with a broad-band source of combustion noise without any peaks, the model (31) will generate peaks in the SPL spectra at fre- quencies real( ω ∗), where the ω ∗’s are the eigenfrequencies of the homogeneous system M x = 0. As sketched in Fig. 8, we should ex- pect a pronounced peak if the imaginary part of an eigenfrequency imag( ω ∗) is small, because in that case the determinant det( M ( ω)) will be close to zero. This behaviour is quite intuitive: persistent forcing of a mildly damped mode can result in large oscillation am- plitudes. On the contrary, a strongly damped mode with imag( ω ∗) ≫ 0 will only exhibit a mild peak, as depicted in Fig. 8 for the modes at higher frequencies. The reader should appreciate that for a stable eigenmode, the inhomogeneous linear system model (31) will in principle afford a quantitative prediction of the sound Reproduction of Papers With permission from C.

What to expect if one of the eigenmodes is unstable? In this case, combustion noise or some other kind of initial perturbation triggers oscillations, which subsequently grow (without the need of a driver) until nonlinear effects lead to saturation. The magnitude of the combustion noise source term is most likely irrelevant for the limit cycle oscillation amplitudes. Furthermore, a linear model is not capable of predicting sound pressure levels in the limit cycle, and it might seem that the model (31) provides no useful informa- tion whatsoever about unstable modes. However, growth rates of thermoacoustic instabilities are in general not very large – realis- tic values correspond to cycle increments of a few percent. This implies that the imaginary part of the eigenfrequency ω ∗ of un- stable modes will be small, i.e. the modes are located close to the real axis Fig. 8, and the inhomogeneous model (31) will produce a pronounced resonance peak at the frequency real( ω ∗) and thereby indicate the presence of an unstable mode. This justiﬁes the use of the inhomogeneous model (31) for thermoacoustic stability anal- ysis. However, the magnitude of the resonance peak should not be equated with the oscillation amplitude in the limit cycle. The discussion in this section may be summarized as follows: the linear, inhomogeneous model M x = b can identify frequencies, where one should expect large oscillation amplitudes. If one de- termines in addition the eigenfrequencies ω ∗ of the homogeneous model M x = 0, one is able to distinguish between peaks in the SPL spectra that result from resonant driving of a stable mode, and those that result from self-excited instability. For the former, am- plitude levels predicted by the liner model may be quantitatively accurate, for the latter a nonlinear model is required to predict limit cycle amplitudes. 7. Results According to elementary considerations, the fundamental ITA mode should occur close to a frequency where the phase of F(ω) equals −π, as argued by Hoeijmakers et al, Emmert et al, and Courtine et al. By inspection of the phase plot in Fig. 5, one estimates this frequency to be near 100 Hz. Indeed, the sound pressure level measured at the combustor exit shows a distinct peak at a frequency of 98 Hz (see Fig. 9 and/or Fig. 10 ). The prox- imity in frequency suggests that this peak may be associated with the ﬁrst mode of the ITA feedback loop. However, the agreement in frequency by itself does not rule out the possibility that by co- incidence we have encountered a cavity acoustic mode of the test rig. In the following, we shall present results of parametric stud- ies carried out with the network model presented in the previ- ous section and considering the ﬂame transfer function F(ω) and Fig. 10. TWC case: Noise spectrum at position ’mic’ predicted by the network model with two-way-coupling and varying values of | r out |: 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 1.00, experimental results. combustion noise source ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) estimated with LES data ( Figs. 5 and 6 ). We shall explore how frequency and strength of resonance peaks, but also frequency and growth rate of eigenmodes of the system matrix M (see Eq. (29) ) vary due to the inclusion of two- way-coupling, and due to changes in exit reﬂection coeﬃcient r out and combustor length l cc. This will allow us to ascertain that in- deed the resonance peak at 98 Hz is due to the ITA feedback loop. A second pronounced peak in sound pressure level is observed at 370 Hz. The network model study will conﬁrm that this peak is related to an acoustic cavity mode (see below). Note that a narrow, low-frequency (130 Hz) peak in the com- bustion noise spectrum of the BRS burner was previously observed and discussed by Weyermann at different operating condi- tions. Unfortunately, at that time the concept of ITA feedback was not yet known. Thus a proper interpretation of this observation and further implications were not developed. 7.01. SPL spectra with one- and two-way coupling In this section we compare the spectral distribution of sound pressure level (SPL) measured in experiment with the results of the network model Eq. (29), for the case in which the combustion chamber length l CC = l 5 + l 6 + l 7 (see Fig. 2 ) is equal to 0.03 m. In addition we study the inﬂuence of the reﬂection coeﬃcient r out ( ω) on the results, which also impacts the complex eigenfrequencies ω ∗ of the system matrix M of Eq. (29). The SPL spectrum observed in experiment at the location ‘mic’ (see Fig. 2 ), which is shown in blue in Fig. 9 and also in Fig. 10, exhibits two prominent peaks around 98 Hz and around 370 Hz. 2 For the low-order network model, let us ﬁrst consider a model variant in which the inﬂuence of the acoustic waves on the un- steady heat release rate of the ﬂame is neglected by setting T AF = [0 0; 0 0] in Eq. (26). Recalling the discussion in the intro- duction, we label this case as OWC for ‘One-Way-Coupling’. In Fig. 9 we show in shades of gray the curves that represent the acoustic pressure estimated by the network model, for the range 0.05 < | r ( ω)| < 1.00. Results of the case where | r(ω) | = 0. 7, which correspond to the ‘reference’ value of | r out | illustrated in Fig. 3, are plotted in red. Remarkably, the peak observed in experiment at 98 Hz is not predicted at all by the network model with OWC. On the other hand, the physically motivated model of ‘Two-Way-Coupling’ (TWC), where the response of the ﬂame to acoustic perturbations 2 In order to avoid confusion, the reader should be aware that these measure- ments are performed on the same experimental setup (see measurements of F(ω) in Fig. 5 ), but considering no external acoustic forcing.

(22), recovers a peak near 98 Hz, see Fig. 10. These results indicate unequivocally that the peak at 98 Hz re- sults not from coupling to a cavity acoustic mode, but from ITA feedback. Let as assume, for the sake of the argument, that a cav- ity acoustic mode exists at 98 Hz. Both OWC and TWC account for the combustion noise source term ˙ Q ′ s as the driving mechanism, thus both models would produce a peak in the SPL as the result of resonance of the noise source term ˙ Q ′ s, which is quite strong in this frequency range (see Fig. 6 ), with the acoustic mode. However, the OWC result does not exhibit a peak in this frequency range, while the TWC result does. Let as assume the alternative, i.e. that an ITA mode exists at 98 Hz. In the OWC model, the ITA feedback loop is broken, because the link between upstream velocity ﬂuctuations u ′ ref and unsteady heat release rate ˙ Q ′ c is severed. Thus the combus- tion noise source term ˙ Q ′ s cannot produce a peak due to resonance with an ITA mode in the OWC model. On the other hand, the TWC model retains the link between u ′ ref and ˙ Q ′ c and consequently, the combustion noise source term ˙ Q ′ s can go in resonance with the ITA feedback loop. We conclude with conﬁdence that the presence of the peak in the TWC model, and its absence in the OWC model, supports the hypothesis that this peak results from ITA feedback. A second peak around 400 Hz is associated with the quarter- wave mode of the combustion chamber and corresponds well with the peak at 370 Hz observed in experiment. Note that the mis- match of 30 Hz is likely due to an overestimation of the hot gas temperature ( T h = 1930 K) obtained by LES and used in the acous- tic network model. The strength of the peak increases with in- creasing magnitude of the exit reﬂection coeﬃcient, as one would expect for a forced oscillation at resonance when acoustic losses decrease. Conversely, the strength of the peak at 98 Hz related to ITA feedback decreases with an increase of the magnitude of the exit reﬂection coeﬃcient. This will be discussed further in the fol- lowing. In closing this section we note that the maxima in the spectral distribution of the combustion noise source ˆ ˙ Q s (ω) –s e e Fig. 6 – do not correspond with the peaks in the SPL spectrum in the com- bustor. This lends further support to our argument that in conﬁned systems resonant coupling between the noise source term and the acoustic environment as well as the ITA feedback loop shape the spectral distribution of combustion noise in a decisive manner. 7.02. Relation between SPL spectra and the poles of M –s t a b l e case In order to further analyze the nature of the resonances near 100 Hz and 400 Hz, Figs. 11 and 12 show pole maps of the system matrix M of the network model (see Eq. (29) ), obtained by solving the characteristic equation det (M(ω ∗)) = 0, where ω ∗ ∈ C, for the eigenfrequencies ω ∗ of the homogeneous system (without driving Fig. 12. TWC case: Pole map of the system matrix M with two-way-coupling for values of | r out |: x 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 1.00. by combustion noise). As mentioned in Section 6, real( ω ∗) is asso- ciated to the resonance frequency whereas -imag( ω ∗) deﬁnes the growth rate of the mode under investigation. The pole map Fig. 11 of the OWC case shows eigenfrequen- cies around 50 Hz and 400 Hz. The 50 Hz mode corresponds to a Helmholtz mode, where the plenum acts as the resonator ‘volume’, and the burner annulus as the ‘neck’ of a Helmholtz resonator. The 400 Hz mode can be identiﬁed as a quarter wave mode of the combustion chamber. The pole map shows clearly that the growth rate of this mode increases as the outlet reﬂection coeﬃcient | r out | increases. This is expected for a cavity acoustic mode, since for larger values of | r out |, the loss of acoustic energy at the outlet boundary decreases. This corresponds to the observation that with larger | r out |, the amplitude of the resonance peak at 400 Hz in- creases, see Figs. 9 and 10. Results for the TWC case, where feedback from the acoustics on the ﬂame is taken into account, are shown in Fig. 12. Additional poles around 100 Hz, 250 Hz, 300 Hz and 450 Hz are observed. In this work, we exclusively concentrate on the mode at 100 Hz, because this is the one with larger growth rate (although still neg- ative) and, therefore, the one that dominates the noise spectrum. A more comprehensive analysis of the nature of the various modes is given by Emmert et al. Again it is very interesting to see the inﬂuence of the magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient | r out | on the eigenfrequencies. The growth rate of the 100 Hz mode increases as | r out | decreases, as seen in Fig. 12. This behavior might seem counter-intuitive at ﬁrst sight, but it does correspond with the de- crease in strength of the SPL peak in Fig. 10. In contrast to acoustic cavity modes, the growth rate of an ITA mode may increase when the acoustic reﬂection at the boundaries is reduced, as already ob- served by Hoeijmakers et al. Speciﬁc ﬂame/burner properties determine whether the growth rate of an ITA mode increases or decreases when lowering acoustic reﬂection at the boundaries. In order to further understand the nature of the resonance at 100 Hz, we will consider a system where no cavity acoustic modes are possible. This is achieved by setting r in, r out = 0 and by disre- garding the plenum from the system by setting T sys 1 = I. In order to fully simplify the resulting expression we consider all lengths l of the system equal to zero. The eigenfrequencies ω ∗ of the simpli- ﬁed system are now easily obtained from the solution of the char- acteristic equation det (M(ω ∗)) = ξ + α2 + α2 θF(ω ∗) = 0, where ω ∗ ∈ C. (33) For the fundamental mode, we obtain a frequency real (ω ∗) = 2 π (106) s −1 and a growth rate −imag (ω ∗) = −18 s −1. We can consider the frequency 106 Hz to be close enough to the one pre- dicted by the complete network model (case TWC) at 100 Hz and observed in experiments at 98 Hz. We conclude, therefore, that the peak at 100 Hz is of ITA nature. Following a similar analysis, Reproduction of Papers With permission from C. Silva, M. Merk, T. Komarek, and W. Polifke.

They are labeled ‘ITA 2’, ‘ITA 3’, ‘ITA 4’ in Figs. 12 and 13. It should be remarked that in order to obtain valid solutions of Eq. (33), the ﬂame transfer func- tion F(ω) must be well-deﬁned for ω ∈ C. This is guaranteed by computing F(ω) as the z -transform of the impulse response, see Eq. (9). 7.03. Relation between the SPL spectra and the poles of M – unstable case In the previous section, we have recognized the presence of the ITA feedback loop in the SPL spectrum of noise. In addition, we have analyzed the inﬂuence of the magnitude of the reﬂection co- eﬃcient | r out | both on the strength of the peaks of the noise spec- trum and on the growth rate of the two main acoustic modes (of cavity resonance and ITA nature, respectively). We study now the inﬂuence of the combustion chamber length l CC on the eigenfre- quencies ω ∗ of these two acoustic modes. Figure 13 shows the trajectories of the eigenfrequencies on the complex plane when varying l CC. The eigenfrequencies that corre- spond to the case l CC = 0. 3 m where | r| = 0. 7 are displayed in red. We observe that an increment of l CC in the range 0.03 m < l CC < 0.07 m changes the resonance frequency of the cavity mode by 50 Hz. This is naturally expected, because a longer combustion chamber can be associated with a longer wavelength of the corresponding cavity mode. In contrast, the frequency of the ITA resonance is only shifted by 5 Hz (see Fig. 13 ) by this change in combustion cham- ber length. The increment of l CC inﬂuences signiﬁcantly also the growth rate of the modes under investigation: Whereas the cavity resonance mode exhibits a reduced growth rate for larger values of l CC, the growth of the ITA mode increases as l CC gets larger. The network model predicts that for l CC > 0.06 the system becomes un- stable due to the positive growth rate of the ITA mode. This trend corresponds well with experiment: Fig. 14 shows measurements of the SPL for the case l CC = 0. 7. We observe a large peak of the fundamental mode at 100 Hz, with corresponding har- monics at multiples of the fundamental frequency. Since this case is recognized as unstable, the amplitude of the peaks caused by the combustion instability correspond to the amplitude of the as- sociated limit cycle. Because the model given by Eq. (29) is based 3 For small values of |imag( ω)| it can be demonstrated that F(ω) = F( real (ω), imag (ω)) is a dilated (or contracted) version of F( real (ω), 0). On the contrary, for large values of |imag( ω)|, the function F( real (ω), imag (ω)) cannot be easily mapped from F( real (ω), 0). In the system under investigation |imag( ω ∗)| is small for the fundamental ITA mode and is large for the modes ITA 2, ITA 3 and ITA 4. Consequently, the value of F( real (ω ∗ ), imag (ω ∗ )) cannot be easily presumed from F( real (ω ∗ ), 0). A further consequence is that the intrinsic eigenfrequencies ω ∗, la- belled ITA 2, ITA 3 and ITA 4 are not found at ∠ F( real (ω), 0) = −3 π, −5 π, −7 π. Fig. 14.

Unstable regions are further sepa- rated in unstable cavity modes and an unstable ITA mode. on linear acoustics and linear ﬂame dynamics, it cannot predict the amplitude of this limit cycle. Nevertheless, the results of the network model can give a good estimate of the frequency of the limit cycle. We observe that the peak measured in experiments corresponds well to the frequency of the unstable ITA mode near 100 Hz. The parametric study is completed by presenting in Fig. 15 the inﬂuence of both reﬂection coeﬃcient | r out | and combustor length l CC on the growth rates of the acoustic modes. We observe that for values of | r out | close to unity the mode corresponding to acoustic cavity resonance is triggered, whereas for lower values of | r out | the ITA mode is predominant. 8. Conclusions and outlook We have studied numerically and experimentally the combus- tion noise produced by a turbulent ﬂame. Peaks in the spectral distribution of sound pressure level were found to result not from corresponding peaks in the spectral distribution of the combus- tion noise source term, but from resonances with acoustic cavity modes or intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) modes. This observation holds for stable as well as unstable conﬁgurations, although peaks in SPL spectra are much more pronounced if thermoacoustic insta- bility occurs. It is concluded that in order to predict combustion noise and resonances of conﬁned turbulent ﬂames, acoustic mod- els must in general account for the two-way-coupling between the sources of noise and the surrounding acoustic ﬁeld. Further impli- cations result for sound radiated by open turbulent ﬂames, where acoustic cavity modes cannot exist due to the anechoic environ- ment. Nevertheless, ITA feedback will be present in general, and the spectrum of noise may be determined by both the broadband nature of the noise source term of the ﬂames, as well as by reso- nance peaks that correspond to ITA feedback.

Silva et al / Combustion and Flame 182 269–278 Furthermore, our results show that ITA modes do not necessar- ily lock on to cavity acoustic modes, as already observed in the studies of Hoeijmakers et al and Emmert et al. Instead, modes of different nature coexist in the test rig investigated in this study, one associated with cavity resonance and another associated with ITA resonance. In this study, these two types of modes are inﬂuenced by acoustic boundaries in a rather different way: While the growth rate of the cavity mode becomes larger with increas- ing magnitude of the downstream reﬂection coeﬃcient | r out |, the growth rate of the ITA mode decreases. Similarly, a change in the length of the combustion chamber l CC – which can be also seen as a change in the argument of r out – causes a large shift in the fre- quency of the cavity mode, whereas it has almost no impact on the frequency of the ITA mode. These ﬁndings are quite important for passive control of thermoacoustic instabilities, because it is classi- cally believed that changes in magnitude or the phase of acoustic boundaries of a combustion system should imply a corresponding shift in the growth rate or resonance frequency of the associated acoustic mode. We have shown that the latter is not always the case if the acoustic mode is of ITA nature. A more in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the nature and the interactions of cav- ity vs. ITA modes was presented by Emmert et al. In this study we have for the ﬁrst time deduced concurrently the ﬂame transfer function and the combustion noise source term of a turbulent ﬂame from LES time series data with system iden- tiﬁcation. The application of advanced system identiﬁcation tech- niques for this task is the topic of ongoing work.

A Box-Jenkins model structure allows SI of both the noise source and the flame dynamics from time series data generated with single LES. The models that result from this ‘black-box’ SI approach are purely data-driven and do not rely on estimates of characteristic flow or flame parameters, such as turbulence intensity or flame length. In confined combustion systems the spectral distribution of combustion noise is strongly modulated by the cavity acoustics and the flame dynamics. By incorporating the identified models into a network model for the combustor acoustics, a linear Reduced Order Model (ROM) is built to predict the spectral distribution of sound pressure within the combustor for two different outlet reflection conditions. The identified flame transfer function as well as the ROM-based predictions of the pressure spectra in the combustor are compared with satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement against measurements. An interpretation of the pressure spectra based on eigenmode analysis elucidates the interplay between combus- tion noise generation, flame dynamics and cavity resonances. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.

The fluctuations of heat release rate may be seen as the sum of two contributions ˙ Q ′ = ˙ Q ′ c + ˙ Q ′ s. (1) Following the nomenclature of, ˙ Q ′ c denotes per- turbations of heat release rate that result from acoustic velocity fluctuations upstream of the flame. This flame dynamic response may be taken into account via a Flame Transfer Function (FTF). Flame dynamics play a key role in self-excited ther- moacoustic instability –w hich is not discussed fur- ther in the present paper –b u t can also shape the spectrum of combustion noise, as will be shown in the following. The second term ˙ Q ′ s describes a broadband source of combustion noise, which re- sults from stochastic activity of the turbulent flow field and is understood to be uncorrelated with in- coming acoustic perturbations. Regarding the spectral distribution of noise generated by turbulent flames, one should distin- guish between unconfined and enclosed configu- rations. In unconfined configurations, the sound pressure spectrum strongly correlates with ˙ Q ′ s and is thus of broadband nature. Nevertheless, even in this case ˙ Q ′ c cannot be neglected: flame intrin- sic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback may establish a two-way coupling between flame and acoustics, where the acoustic field generated by the flame causes velocity fluctuations upstream of the flame. These fluctuations in turn perturb the flame, caus- ing a contribution ˙ Q ′ c to the fluctuations of heat re- lease rate that may go in constructive or destructive interference with the noise source term ˙ Q ′ s. Conse- quently, the sound pressure spectrum is modulated. In case of an enclosed flame, acoustic reflections at the system boundaries constitute an additional feedback loop, which may modulate the shape of the sound pressure spectrum in a distinctive man- ner. The noise source ˙ Q ′ s may excite an acoustic cav- ity mode, causing resonance peaks in the pressure spectrum. Hence, the sound pressure level and its spectral distribution depend in general strongly on the acoustic boundaries of the combustion sys- tem. To reduce the overall sound pressure level in ap- plied confined systems and to better understand the nature of the sound spectrum, accurate, re- liable and flexible prediction methods are neces- sary, which take all relevant thermo-acoustic mech- anisms into account. ‘Flexible’ here means that it should be possible to assess in a convenient and af- fordable manner the effect of changes in the acous- tic boundary conditions, say, or the combustor ge- ometry on the pressure spectrum. Obviously, sound pressure levels in a combus- tion system may be determined by measurement [6–8]. However, experiments are rather laborious and inflexible in regard to changes in the acous- tic boundaries. Reactive compressible Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) resolves directly the combustion noise generation as well as the acoustic propaga- tion and reflection within the cavity and has proven itself to be capable of reproducing accurately the sound pressure spectra in confined systems [8–10]. Even though changes in the acoustic boundaries are feasible to implement, the computational ef- fort of LES is considerable, and the investigation of a wide range of parameters, say, is prohibitively expensive. Linear acoustic network models, on the other hand, are computationally much less demanding. Acoustic propagation, reflection and dissipation are described by network elements that relate the acoustic field up- and downstream of each ele- ment. In combination with an FTF, which de- scribes the flame dynamics, and a model for the generation of combustion noise, a Reduced Order Model (ROM) can be formulated that should allow quantitative estimation of the sound pressure level for thermoacoustically stable configurations. Whereas acoustic propagation, damping and reflec- tion within the network model are rather straight- forward to describe, the determination of the FTF and the noise source is more challenging. A combustion noise source vector in terms of emitted characteristic wave amplitudes may be ex- tracted experimentally, but the experimental assessment of the combustion noise source is dif- ficult and laborious. An alternative approach re- lies on a Strouhal number scaling for the noise source [12–14]. These models predict an increase of the combustion noise source strength towards a peak frequency, with a subsequent roll-off to higher frequencies. These estimations rely on various as- sumptions that depend on the flame type and re- quire detailed information about the flow field and the flame shape as model input. The reader is reminded at this point that accord- ing to Eq. (1) the determination of only the noise source ˙ Q ′ s is not sufficient for an accurate prediction of combustion generated sound via a ROM. The possibility of two-way coupling requires to take into account also the flame response to acoustic fluctuations ˙ Q ′ c, i.e. to incorporate also the FTF into the ROM. In the current work the FTF as well as a noise source model are derived from a LES / System Iden- tification (LES/SI) approach. Instead of the widely used Finite Impulse Response (FIR) identi- fication, which only estimates the FTF from broadband LES time series data, a Box-Jenkins (BJ) model identification is applied. In addition to a deterministic part, the BJ model includes also the estimation of a stochastic process. This model structure corresponds directly to the two contri- butions of the heat release fluctuations shown in Eq. (1) and makes possible the simultaneous identification of the FTF and the noise source from Please cite this article as: M.

Application of BJ identification in the field of thermoacoustics was explored by Silva et al in a numerical study of a laminar flame, where stochastic combustion noise was mimicked by im- posed equivalence ratio fluctuations. Merk et al investigated on the basis of surrogate data the general applicability of BJ identification to thermoacoustic systems, with emphasis on optimal model order, error margins and confidence levels. The present study is the first to apply BJ identifica- tion to actual LES time series data of a turbulent combustor and to juxtapose the subsequent ROM- based predictions of sound pressure spectra with a unique set of experimental results, where the flame dynamics (i.e. the FTF), the spectral distribution of sound pressure and the acoustic boundary condi- tions were measured with quantitative accuracy. 2. Experimental configuration The turbulent swirl combustor shown in Fig. 1 was developed at EM 2 C laboratory, Paris. A methane and air mixture of equivalence ratio equal to φ = 0. 82 is injected at the bottom of the plenum. After flowing through the upstream plenum, a first convergent (contraction ratio: 8.073), a radial swirler and an injection tube, the mixture enters the com- bustion chamber. In the injection tube of diameter D = 20 mm, which has a reduced cross section due Fig. 2. Measured modulus (top) and phase (bottom) of the outlet reflection coefficients for an open end ( ) and a perforated plate ( ). Solid lines ( ) show the fitted transfer functions used in the ROM. to the central bluff body, a bulk flow velocity of u b = 7. 1 m/s is reached yielding a Reynolds number of Re = u b D / ν ≈ 7000 at p = 1 atm and T = 20 °C. In the combustion chamber a swirl stabilized V- shaped flame develops with a thermal power of P th = 5. 5 k W. The burnt gases leave the combus- tion chamber through a small convergent exhaust (contraction ratio: 2.003) without indirect combus- tion noise production. In order to measure the FTF, acoustic forc- ing is applied with a loudspeaker (Monacor SP- 6/108 PRO - 100 W RMS) mounted at the plenum bottom. At the reference position “HW”in Fig. 1, the resulting velocity fluctuations u ′ ref are mea- sured by a hot-wire probe (Dantec Dynamics Mini- CTA 54 T 30 with a 55 P 16 probe). Combustion chamber walls made of quartz glass provide opti- cal access to the flame. A photomultiplier mounted with an interferometric filter centered on 310 ± 10 nm records the OH ∗ chemiluminescence signal of the flame, which is assumed to be proportional to the heat release rate. The FTF is deduced from the photomultiplier and hot-wire signals by sweeping the excitation frequency while maintaining a per- turbation level of 10% of the mean flow speed at the hot wire probe. The acoustic pressure within the combustion chamber is measured by the microphone “MC”in Fig. 1. It is mounted on a water-cooled waveguide, which is connected to the backplate of the com- bustion chamber. A fully reflecting rigid wall ter- minates the upstream end of the combustor. On the downstream side the combustor is either open- ended or equipped with a perforated plate having the same outer diameter as the convergent exhaust and a square pattern of 12 holes of radius R = 2.05 mm with an inter-hole spacing d = 20 mm. For both conditions, the reflection coefficient is mea- sured with the three-microphone method. Re- sults are shown in Fig. 2.

Simultaneous identification of Flame Transfer Function and noise model from LES To determine the FTF and the noise source nu- merically, the time series data of a compressible LES is post-processed via advanced SI techniques. Flame dynamics, noise generation and acoustic propagation are all accounted for in the compress- ible LES by means of the solver AVBP. The LES domain, represented by the shaded area in Fig. 1, fully resolves the radial swirler and the com- bustor geometry without geometric simplifications. An unstructured mesh with approximately 19 mil- lion tetrahedral cells exhibits a maximum cell size of 0.06 mm in the flame region and 1.05 mm the burnt gas region, respectively. A dynamically thickened flame model resolves the flame thickness with at least 7 cells. A global 2-step chemical reaction mechanism optimized for premixed methane/air mixture is used. Non-reflective boundary con- ditions using a wave masking technique are ap- plied. The upstream plenum is not part of the LES domain. From experiments, however, it is known that the flow after the first convergent is laminar. Thus, a laminar velocity profile is imposed at the inlet. For further details and validation of the LES setup, the reader is referred to. Instead of deducing laboriously the flame re- sponse at discrete frequencies from repeated LES runs with harmonic flow forcing, a broadband ex- citation signal is applied at the LES inlet. The wavelet type excitation signal used has a constant power spectral density up to a cut-off frequency of 1000 Hz. As in experiment the forcing amplitude corresponds to 10% of the mean inlet velocity. Note that a trade-off has to be made, regarding the forc- ing amplitude. A small forcing amplitude yields a low signal-to-noise ratio with possibly unsatisfac- tory results of the identification procedure. A large forcing amplitude may trigger a non-linear flame response, which can not be adequately de- scribed by the linear identification techniques used. Time series data of the acoustic velocity fluctua- tions at the reference position u ′ ref (t) (input) and of the total heat release rate fluctuations ˙ Q ′ (t) (out- put) are extracted from the LES. The length of the generated input-output time series amounts to 350 ms, which is down sampled to a cut-off fre- quency of 1000 Hz for the subsequent BJ identi- fication. As shown in Eq. (1) the key concept is to sepa- rate the fluctuations of total heat release rate into two contributions: a part resulting from the acous- tic excitation ˙ Q ′ c, and a second term ˙ Q ′ s that is un- correlated to the acoustic forcing, but instead ac- counts for the contribution of combustion noise. By definition, a BJ model is composed of a deter- ministic sub-model plus a sub-model for stochastic noise –a structure that corresponds exactly to the modeling approach implied by Eq. (1). Formally, one writes ˙ Q ′ (t, θ) = B(q, θ) F (q, θ)    G u ′ ref (t) + C(q, θ) D (q, θ)    H e (t). (2) The deterministic model G represents the FTF and establishes a causal relation between the in- put u ′ ref (t) and the deterministic part of the out- put ˙ Q ′ (t, θ). Conversely, the noise model H filters a Gaussian White Noise input signal e ( t ), which is uncorrelated to the input signal. The filters B ( q, θ), F ( q, θ) and C ( q, θ), D ( q, θ) that appear in the above equation are polynomials in the time shift operator q, defined as q −i u ′ ref (t) ≡ u ′ ref (t − i/Delta 1 t). The filters B and C relate prior in- puts to the current output ˙ Q ′ (t, θ). F and D can describe possible auto-regressive behavior, as they relate prior outputs q −i ˙ Q ′ (t) to the current out- put. The vector of polynomial coefficients θ = { b 0. b n b, f 0, d n d } weighs the relations between present as well as prior input and output signals. The number of prior samples taken into account is determined by the polynomial filter orders { n b, n c, n d, n f }. This becomes apparent when rewriting the above equation as follows ˙ Q ′ (t, θ) = ∑ n b i=0 b i q −i ∑ n f i=0 f i q −i u ′ ref (t)    ˙ Q ′ c + ∑ n c i=0 c i q −i ∑ n d i=0 d i q −i e (t)    ˙ Q ′ s. (3) This equation also makes explicit the structural equivalence of the BJ model to Eq. (1). During identification of a BJ model, the vector of poly- nomial model coefficients θ is estimated by a non- linear least-squares problem that minimizes the er- ror between estimated and actual output. To summarize, the model output ˙ Q ′ (t, θ) results from a convolution of the respective polynomial fil- ters with prior input and output samples, see Eq. (3). Note that if the polynomial filters F, C and D are set to unity, the widely used FIR model struc- ture is recovered. The FIR describes the combustion noise problem in a less comprehen- sive manner than the BJ model structure. Although combustion noise is known to be colored, the FIR approach does not identify a noise model, but instead treats the noise contribution as a white noise disturbance. The BJ identification, however, drops the white noise assumption by explicitly fil- tering a generic Gaussian White Noise signal e ( t ) through the estimated noise filter H resulting in a Please cite this article as: M.

This contri- bution mimics directly the effect of colored turbu- lent velocity fluctuations that would cause a cer- tain spectral distribution of heat release rate fluc- tuations, by shaping the same stochastic contribu- tion from the generic Gaussian White Noise signal. Further details on the BJ model and its implica- tions in the field of thermoacoustics can be found in. By applying the BJ identification on the LES time series, the FTF ( G ) and the noise model ( H ) are identified simultaneously. Auto-regressive behavior within the FTF is not expected, thus n f is set equal to n f = 1. The remaining polynomial orders are set to n b = 30, n c = 6, n d = 6. The data processing and the model identification are realized via MATLAB 2016 b. In Fig. 3 the identified FTF ( ) is shown and compared against measured values ( ). Error bars for the measured FTF values stem from three ex- perimental data sets for the same operating con- ditions and represent reproducibility of the exper- iment. For further comparison the FTF is also identified with the established FIR model structure ( ), in which the model order is chosen as the sum of n b + n c + n d. The number of estimated pa- rameters is hence equal in both approaches. For the FTF gain both identified models yield sim- ilar values and describe the measured FTF val- ues with slight deviations. The phase values of the identified models are in excellent agreement with the measured values. Comparable results be- tween BJ and FIR identification suggest that de- viations from experimental results stem not from the BJ identification procedure. Rather uncertain- ties in the experimental measurement itself (see in- creasing error bars for increasing frequencies in Fig. 3 ) or inadequacies in the LES for the flame dynamics description might be responsible for the deviations. Fig. 4. Noise model identified via BJ identification ( ) with 95% confidence interval represented by the shaded area. Figure 4 depicts the identified noise model H. It shows that the noise source peaks slightly above 200 Hz. The amplitude of H has to be interpreted in ter ms of nor malized heat release rate fluctuations, meaning that e.g. at 200 Hz, the noise source am- plitude amounts to about 13% of the mean heat re- lease rate. For the further usage of the noise model, the absolute level of noise fluctuations is conse- quently fixed by specifying the mean heat release rate. As the BJ identification results in a data-driven model, a prerequisite for a reliable noise model identification is that the LES, from which the time series data is extracted, correctly reproduces the combustion noise generation. If the SI procedure is fed with erroneous data (e.g. if the LES generates spurious heat release rate fluctuations), erroneous noise models will result, independent of the chosen model structure. For the current study the validity of the LES with respect to the combustion noise generation was validated in by comparing LES results against measured sound pressure spectra. Note that to a certain extent the combustion noise generation is independent from the flame dynam- ics. The generation of combustion noise strongly depends on the incoming turbulent velocity field, which in turn only plays a secondary role for the flame dynamics. This means that inaccuracies in the FTF identification are not directly transferable to the estimated noise model. In closing this section it is remarked that the BJ identification could be applied to any signal in par- ticular experimentally measured broadband data. However, since broadband forcing is not available in the test-rig facility, a one-to-one validation of the identified noise source model H for the com- bustion noise source is not possible. Nonetheless, the comparison presented below of measured and predicted sound pressure spectra, where the latter directly depends on the identified noise model H, corroborate the accuracy of the noise model H. 4. Reduced order model The identified FTF and the noise model are in- corporated into a linear acoustic network model of the combustor. The network model, which is Please cite this article as: M.

The expressions for duct sections and area jumps, which are derived from linearized Euler equations, are written in terms of length and cross section ra- tio, respectively. No loss coefficients are introduced in order to avoid uncertain modeling parameters. For a detailed formulation of these elements the reader is referred to. At the downstream end the reflection coefficient is taken into account by [ f d g d ] = [ 0 0 −R out (ω) 1 ][ f u g u ] (4) Depending on the outlet condition studied, the out- let reflection coefficient R out is adapted according to the polynomial fits shown in Fig. 2. At the com- bustor upstream end, the rigid plate is assumed to be fully reflecting with R in = 1. The acoustic trans- fer behavior of the complex radial swirler geometry is represented by a 2 × 2 scattering matrix identi- fied from LES on a domain that only comprises the swirler geometry. Note that the compressible LES takes acoustic losses across the swirler into account such that they are implicitly included in the identi- fied scattering matrix of the radial swirler. Conse- quently, acoustic losses are only taken into account across the swirler element and at the downstream end via R out. By means of the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across a thin reaction zone, the identified FTF and the noise model are coupled into the linear network model across the flame ele- ment by [ f d g d ] = [ ξ + 1 ξ − 1 ξ − 1 ξ + 1 ][ f u g u ] + A inj A cc /Theta 1 G(ω) [ 1 −1 −1 1 ][f ref g ref ] − S, (5) where the noise source S is introduced as S = A inj A cc ¯u inj /Theta 1 H (ω) e [ −1 ] (6) Furthermore, ξ denotes the specific acoustic impedance and /Theta 1 the temperature jump across the flame /Theta 1= T b /T c − 1. The transfer matrix of the passive flame, i.e. the temperature discontinu- ity across the flame, is taken into account by the first term on the rhs. of Eq. (5). The second term describes the active flame part and hence the effect of unsteady flame heat release in response to ve- locity perturbations at the reference position. The third term S accounts for the contribution from the combustion noise source term. Note that this for- mulation implicitly recovers the two-way coupling between noise source and flame dynamics. All parameters used in the network model are given in Table 1. The eigenfrequencies predicted by the network model ( ) agree with measured eigenfrequencies for non-reactive conditions, see Fig. 6. The FTF is not taken into account here. Only the fourth eigenmode shows a slight discrepancy. Thus, it is concluded that the acoustic network model fairly well captures the eigenmodes of the combustor cav- ity, which is a prerequisite for the following sound pressure prediction of the reactive setup. Moreover, in Fig. 6 it gets evident that an increase of the mean temperature in the combustion chamber T h mainly affects the second eigenmode. This eigen- mode corresponds predominantly to a λ/4 wave mode within the combustion chamber. Hence, its frequency is strongly modulated by an increased combustion chamber temperature and the thereof resulting increase in the speed of sound. The first and third eigenmode are associated with the com- bustor Helmholtz mode and a λ/2 plenum mode, respectively. Both are predominantly active in the plenum and consequently hardly affected by the in- crease of T h. 5. ROM based sound pressure predictions The ROM, now including the identified FTF model G ( ω) and the noise model H ( ω), is evalu- ated in the frequency domain and the spectrum of the acoustic pressure fluctuations in the combus- tion chamber (p’ MC in Fig. 5 ) is compared with cor- responding measurements. The 95% confidence in- terval is computed by propagating the uncertainties of the identified noise model through the network model. The influence of the uncertainties in the FTF identification on the sound pressure predic- tion are found to be small and are thus neglected. Fig. 7 shows excellent agreement between the experimental spectrum ( ) and the ROM pre- diction ( ). Note that due to the cavity acous- tics, the sound pressure spectrum differs markedly from the spectral distribution of the combustion Please cite this article as: M.

Measured sound pressure spectrum ( ) and ROM prediction for the configuration equipped with a perforated plate: two-way coupling ( ) with confidence interval, one-way coupling ( ). here, such that the cavity is only excited by the noise source. Hence, the feedback from the acous- tic field onto the upstream velocity field and the thereof resulting heat release rate fluctuations are neglected. Overall, one-way coupling produces ac- ceptable results, with the exception of amplitude and frequency of the spectral peak that results from acoustic resonance. Similar behavior is reported in. Note that taking ˙ Q ′ c into account, as it is done with two-way coupling ( ), does not necessarily imply an increase in the sound pressure spectrum. The relative phase between ˙ Q ′ s and ˙ Q ′ c determines whether interference is constructive or destructive. Figure 8 shows the sound pressure spectra that result if the downstream end of the combustor is equipped with the perforated plate. Note that jet noise generated by the flow crossing the perforated plate causes a less smooth experimental spectrum compared to the open-ended configuration shown in Fig. 7. From evaluating the mode shapes de- picted in Fig. 6, it is evident that a change of the outlet reflection condition mainly affects the sec- ond cavity mode. Indeed, the sound pressure peak observed in the open-ended configuration vanishes when the combustor is terminated by the perforated plate. A decreased outlet reflection reduces acous- tic reflections at the system boundary and conse- quently weakens the modulation of the sound pres- sure spectrum by the cavity acoustics. As a result the sound pressure spectrum follows more closely the spectral distribution of the combustion noise source shown in Fig. 4. Note that a change in the acoustic boundary of the combustor does neither modify the flame dynamics nor the combustion noise source. Thus, the same models for G ( ω) and H ( ω) are used and the experimental results can be reproduced with negligible computational cost by merely adjusting the cavity of the network model. 6.

The Box-Jenkins model does not assume white noise and allows thus the addi- tional identification of a data-driven noise model, which provides insight into the amplitude and spec- tral distribution of the combustion noise source. Combined with a linear network model for the cav- ity acoustics of the combustor, a reduced order model is built to predict sound pressure spectra and their associated confidence intervals. Two different configurations are studied that differ by their re- spective outlet reflection coefficient. Since a change in the acoustic boundary does not affect the flame dynamics and the combustion noise source, only the outlet reflection coefficient of the reduced order model has to be adopted to represent the two con- figurations. Convincing agreement with measure- ments of flame transfer function and sound pres- sure spectra is found. Compared to stand-alone LES, the proposed methodology allows the evalua- tion of the sound pressure spectrum across a large parameter space with reduced computational ef- fort. Even if the flame operating conditions change, only one additional LES computation is required to derive again models for the flame dynamics and the noise source. Although it would also be possible to directly extract the sound pressure level for one cer- tain configuration from LES, the ROM approach provides additionally valuable insight into the in- terplay between generation of combustion noise, flame dynamics and cavity resonances. Hence, a computational efficient approach is retained that offers a comprehensive examination of the nature of sound pressure peaks and allows the optimiza- tion of the combustor in terms of combustion noise levels reached.
